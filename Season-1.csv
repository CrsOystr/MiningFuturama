1, 1, Fry, Space. It seems to go on and on forever. But then you get to the end and the gorilla starts throwing barrels at you.
1, 1, Fry, And that's how you play the game!
1, 1, Boy, You stink, loser!
1, 1, Panucci, Hey, Fry. Pizza goin' out! C'mon!!
1, 1, Fry, Michelle, baby! Where you going?
1, 1, Michelle, It's not working out, Fry.   I put your stuff out on the sidewalk!
1, 1, Fry, I hate my life, I hate my life, I hate my life.
1, 1, Bike Thief, Happy new year!
1, 1, Fry, Hello? Pizza delivery for, uh ...  ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud! I always thought at this point in my life I'd be the one making the crank calls!  Here's to another lousy millennium.
1, 1, Crowd, Ten!
1, 1, Crowd, Neuf!
1, 1, Crowd, Otto!
1, 1, Crowd, Saba!
1, 1, Crowd, Eksi!
1, 1, Crowd, Wu!
1, 1, Crowd, Char!
1, 1, Crowd, Thathu!
1, 1, Crowd, Nee!
1, 1, Crowd, One!
1, 1, Fry, What the--?
1, 1, Fry, My God! It's the future. My parents, my co-workers, my girlfriend; I'll never see any of them again. Yahoo!
1, 1, Terry, Welcome to the world of tomorrow!
1, 1, Lou, Why do you always have to say it that way?
1, 1, Terry, Haven't you ever heard of a little thing called showmanship?   Come, your destiny awaits!
1, 1, Lou, Have a nice future.
1, 1, Fry, Cool! Just like in Star Trek!  Ow!
1, 1, Leela, Good afternoon, sir.  Name?
1, 1, Fry, Uh, Fry.
1, 1, Leela, I'm Leela. Now, it's New Year's Eve so I'd like to decide your fate quickly and get out of here.
1, 1, Fry, Can I ask you a question?
1, 1, Leela, As long as it's not about my eye.
1, 1, Fry, Uh...
1, 1, Leela, Is it about my eye?
1, 1, Fry, Sort of.
1, 1, Leela, Just ask the question.
1, 1, Fry, What's with the eye?
1, 1, Leela, I'm an alien, alright? Now let's drop the subject.
1, 1, Fry, Cool, an alien! Has your race taken over the Earth?
1, 1, Leela, No, I just work here.
1, 1, Fry, Wait a minute! Is that blimp accurate?
1, 1, Leela, Yep. It's December 31st, 2999.
1, 1, Fry, My God! A million years!
1, 1, Leela, I'm sure this must be very upsetting for you.
1, 1, Fry, Y'know, I guess it should be but, actually, I'm glad. I had nothing to live for in my old life. I was broke, I had a humiliating job and I was beginning to suspect my girlfriend might be cheating on me.
1, 1, Leela, Well, at least here you'll be treated with dignity. Now strip naked and get on the probulator.
1, 1, Leela, Interesting. Your DNA test shows one living relative. He's your great-great-great-great-great-great-great...
1, 1, Leela, ...great-great-great-great-great nephew.
1, 1, Fry, That's great! What's the little guy's name?
1, 1, Leela, Professor Hubert Farnsworth.
1, 1, Fry, Eurgh!
1, 1, Fry, Y'know, I'm the luckiest guy in the whole future. I've been given a second chance and this time I'm not going to be a total loser.  What's that?
1, 1, Leela, Your permanent career assignment.
1, 1, Fry, Delivery boy? No! Not again! Please! Anything else!
1, 1, Leela, Take your hands off me! You've been assigned the job you're best at just like everyone else.
1, 1, Fry, What if I refuse?
1, 1, Leela, Then you'll be fired--
1, 1, Fry, Fine!
1, 1, Leela, Out of a cannon into the Sun!
1, 1, Fry, But I don't like being a delivery boy.
1, 1, Leela, Well that's tough! Lots of people don't like their jobs but we do them anyway.  You gotta do what you gotta do. Now hold out your hand. I'm gonna implant your career chip. It'll permanently label you as a delivery boy.
1, 1, Fry, Keep that thing away from me!
1, 1, Leela, Hold still, dammit. I don't have good depth perception!  You've got until the count of five to let me out of here. One--
1, 1, Fry, See you in a thousand years!  You owe me one.
1, 1, Fry, Whoa!
1, 1, Man #1, JFK Jr. Airport.
1, 1, Man #1, Radio City Mutant Hall.
1, 1, Fry, Cool!  Um. Cross Town Express?
1, 1, Man #2, Pft! Tourist!
1, 1, Fry, Hey! A phone booth! I can call my nephew.  Wow! A real live robot! Or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?
1, 1, Bender, Bite my shiny metal ass.
1, 1, Fry, It doesn't look so shiny to me.
1, 1, Bender, Shinier than yours, meatbag!
1, 1, Bender, Listen, buddy, I'm in a hurry here. Let's try for a two-fer!
1, 1, Booth Voice, Please select mode of death
1, 1, Fry, Yeah, I'd like to place a collect call.
1, 1, Booth Voice, You have selected
1, 1, Bender, Great choice!  Bring it on, baby!
1, 1, Bender, C'mon, c'mon! Kill me already! By the way, my name's Bender!
1, 1, Fry, Help! What's happening?
1, 1, Booth Voice, You are now dead. Thank you for using Stop-N-Drop, America's favourite suicide booth since 2008.
1, 1, Bender, Lousy, stinking rip-off!  Well, I didn't have anything else planned for today. Let's go get drunk!
1, 1, Leela, Two, three-- Hey!
1, 1, Terry, Welcome to the world of tomorrow!
1, 1, Leela, Shut up, Terry.
1, 1, Ipgee, This is unacceptable, Leela. You must find this Mr. Fry and install his chip.
1, 1, Leela, Look, he's just a nobody who doesn't want to be a delivery boy. I'd really rather not force it on him.
1, 1, Ipgee, Well that's your job, whether you like it or not. And it's my job to make you do your job whether I like it or not, which I do, very much! Now get to work!  Life is good!
1, 1, Fry, Why would a robot need to drink?
1, 1, Bender, I don't need to drink, I can quit anytime I want!  So they made you a delivery boy, huh? Man, that's as bad as my job.
1, 1, Fry, Really? What do you do, Bender?
1, 1, Bender, I'm a bender. I bend girders, that's all I'm programmed to do.
1, 1, Fry, You any good at it?
1, 1, Bender, You kidding? I was a star! I could bend a girder to any angle
1, 1, Fry, What?
1, 1, Bender, Suicide booths!  Well, Fry, it was a pleasure meeting you. I'm gonna go kill myself.
1, 1, Fry, Wait! You're the only friend I have!
1, 1, Bender, You really want a robot for a friend?
1, 1, Fry, Yeah, ever since I was six.
1, 1, Bender, Well, OK. But I don't want people thinking we're robo-sexuals. So, if anyone asks, you're my debugger.
1, 1, Fry, Oh, no, it's the Cyclops!  Don't look! Don't look!
1, 1, Bender, I'm not looking!
1, 1, Leela, This is officer 1B-DI requesting back-up.
1, 1, Smitty, We'll be there in five minutes.
1, 1, Bender, We can hide in here. It's free on Tuesdays!
1, 1, Nimoy, Welcome to the Head Museum. I'm Leonard Nimoy.
1, 1, Fry, Spock? Hey! Hey... Do the thing!
1, 1, Nimoy, I don't do that anymore.
1, 1, Fry, This is unbelievable! What do you heads do all day?
1, 1, Nimoy, We share our wisdom with those who seek it. It's a life of quiet dignity.
1, 1, Woman, Feeding time!
1, 1, Leela, Hmm.  I'm sorry, Fry, but I have to install your career chip.
1, 1, Fry, Yeah, well, if you're sorry why are you doing it?
1, 1, Leela, It's my job. You gotta do what you gotta do!  Watch it!
1, 1, Nixon, That's it! You just made my list!
1, 1, Fry, Ow! Stop it! Down, boy! Bad president!
1, 1, Smitty, Alright, buddy, step away from the head!
1, 1, URL, I'm gonna get 24th century on his ass!
1, 1, Leela, Please, officers, there's no need to use force.
1, 1, URL, Let us handle this, weird-y.
1, 1, Leela, Oh, come on, he's just a poor kid from the Stupid Ages.
1, 1, Smitty, Keep your big nose out of this, eyeball!
1, 1, Leela, No-one makes fun of my nose.
1, 1, URL, Damn!
1, 1, Leela, You guys were totally out of control.
1, 1, Smitty, It's our job. We're peace officers.
1, 1, URL, Yeah, you know the law
1, 1, Bender, Oh, we're trapped!
1, 1, Fry, Wait a second. You're a bender, right? We can get out of here if you just bend the bars.
1, 1, Bender, Dream on, skin tube. I'm only programmed to bend for constructive purposes. What do I look like, a de-bender?
1, 1, Fry, Who cares what you're programmed for. If someone programmed you to jump off a bridge would you do it?
1, 1, Bender, I'll have to check my program ... yep.
1, 1, Leela, Open up!
1, 1, Fry, C'mon, Bender! It's up to you to make your own decisions in life. That's what separates people and robots from animals ... and animal robots.
1, 1, Bender, You're full of crap, Fry!  You make a persuasive argument, Fry.
1, 1, Fry, Come on, Bender! You can do it.
1, 1, Bender, Can't ... I ... can't ... do ... it!
1, 1, Fry, Yes!
1, 1, Bender, You were right, Fry! From now on I'm going to bend what I want, when I want, who I want! I'm unstoppable!
1, 1, Fry, I don't know how you did that.
1, 1, Leela, Wait!
1, 1, Bender, No, thanks.
1, 1, Bender, Looks like one of us will have to bend this grate.
1, 1, Fry, Good Lord! What is this?
1, 1, Bender, It's the decaying ruins of Old New York. Welcome home, pal!
1, 1, Fry, It's my old neighbourhood. Man, this brings back a lot of memories.
1, 1, Bender, Keep 'em to yourself, Pops!
1, 1, Fry, This is where I brought my girlfriend on our very first date.
1, 1, Fry, My God! She's gone. Everyone I ever knew or cared about is gone.
1, 1, Bender, Wait! There's someone you know!
1, 1, Fry, Oh, can't you leave me alone? I'm miserable enough already.
1, 1, Leela, Look, I know it's not much consolation but I understand how you feel.
1, 1, Fry, No, you don't. I've got no home, no family--
1, 1, Bender, No friends.
1, 1, Fry, My whole world is gone. You can't possibly understand what it feels like to be so alone.
1, 1, Leela, I understand. I'm the only one-eyed alien on this whole planet. My parents abandoned me here as a baby and I don't even know what galaxy they were from. I know how it feels to be alone.
1, 1, Fry, Look, Leela, I don't understand this world but you obviously do, so I give up. If you really think I should be a delivery boy, I'll do it.  Your chip. What are you doing?
1, 1, Leela, Quitting.
1, 1, Fry, Why?
1, 1, Leela, Because I've always wanted to. I just never realised it before I met you.
1, 1, Fry, What is the matter with you?
1, 1, Bender, I just wanted to be part of the moment.
1, 1, Leela, Hey! He stole my ring!
1, 1, Bender, Sorry.  Well, that solves the mystery of the missing ring. This calls for a drink.
1, 1, Leela, I don't wanna spoil the party but we're all job deserters now. We're unemployed and we have nowhere to go.
1, 1, Fry, Correction
1, 1, Clark, Hello, I'm Dick Clark's head. Welcome to a special year 3000 edition of New Year's Rockin' Eve!
1, 1, Farnsworth, Who are you?
1, 1, Fry, I'm your dear old Uncle Fry.
1, 1, Farnsworth, I don't have an Uncle Fry.
1, 1, Bender, You do now!
1, 1, Farnsworth, By God, I am your nephew! This is absolutely incredible!
1, 1, Bender, Can we have some money?
1, 1, Farnsworth, Oh, my, no.
1, 1, Farnsworth, Let me show you around. That's my lab table and this is my work-stool. And over there is my intergalactic spaceship!  And here's where I keep assorted lengths of wire.
1, 1, Fry, Whoa! A real live spaceship!
1, 1, Farnsworth, I designed it myself. Let me show you some of the different lengths of wire I used.
1, 1, Smitty, Attention, job deserters! Come out with your hands up. We have you partially surrounded.
1, 1, Fry, No!
1, 1, Nixon, Get those bums!
1, 1, Bender, Well, we're boned!
1, 1, Leela, Can't we get away in the ship?
1, 1, Farnsworth, I suppose it is technically possible. Though I am already in my pyjamas.
1, 1, Fry, I'll get us out of here.
1, 1, Farnsworth, Can anyone drive stick?
1, 1, Leela, I can. As long as I don't have to parallel park.
1, 1, URL, If they try to take off, give 'em an ass-ful of laser.
1, 1, Leela, Prepare for lift-off. Ten.
1, 1, Crowd, Nine!
1, 1, Crowd, Amania!
1, 1, Crowd, Seven!
1, 1, Aliens, Six.
1, 1, Terry, Five!
1, 1, Nimoy, Four.
1, 1, Farnsworth, Three.
1, 1, Bender, Two.
1, 1, Leela, One!
1, 1, Fry, Blast-off!
1, 1, Nixon, Fire! Fire!
1, 1, Smitty, I can't see nothing. Pretty though!
1, 1, Fry, So, I guess, without jobs, we'll be fugitives forever.
1, 1, Farnsworth, Not necessarily. Are you three, by any chance, interested in becoming my new spaceship crew?
1, 1, Bender, New crew? W-What happened to the old crew?
1, 1, Farnsworth, Of those poor sons of-- But that's not important. The important thing is I need a new crew. Anyone interested?
1, 1, Fry, Yes! Yes! That's exactly the job I've always wanted!
1, 1, Leela, Thanks for the offer, Professor, but we don't have the proper career chips.
1, 1, Farnsworth, Oh, that won't be a problem. As luck would have it, I saved the chips from my previous crew.
1, 1, Fry, This is awesome! Are we gonna fly through space fighting monsters and teaching alien women to lurve?
1, 1, Farnsworth, If by that you mean transporting cargo then yes. It's a little home business I started to fund my research.
1, 1, Fry, Cool! What's my job gonna be?
1, 1, Farnsworth, You will be responsible for ensuring that the cargo reaches its destination.
1, 1, Fry, So, I'm gonna be a delivery boy?
1, 1, Farnsworth, Exactly!
1, 1, Fry, Alright! I'm a delivery boy!
1, 2, Farnsworth, As new employees, I'd like your opinion on our commercial. I paid to have it air during the Super Bowl.
1, 2, Fry, Wow!
1, 2, Farnsworth, Not on the same channel, of course.
1, 2, Announcer, Interplanetary deliveries - what a headache!
1, 2, Horrible Gelatinous Blob, Evans! Where's that package from Earth?
1, 2, Man, Uh...   I'm not Evans!
1, 2, Horrible Gelatinous Blob, He should've used Planet Express!
1, 2, Announcer, When those other companies aren't brave or foolhardy enough to go, trust Planet Express for reliable, on time delivery.
1, 2, Evans, Here's your package, Mr. Horrible Gelatinous Blob.
1, 2, Horrible Gelatinous Blob, Good work, Evans! You've got a future around here.
1, 2, Evans, Thank you, sir!
1, 2, Announcer, Planet Express
1, 2, Fry, Are there really giant birds like that?
1, 2, Farnsworth, No, no! That was all just special effects! Now let's have breakfast. I hope everyone likes eggs.
1, 2, Fry, I'm never going to get used to the 31st century.  Caffinated bacon? Baconated grapefruit? Admiral Crunch?
1, 2, Leela, Well, if you don't like that, try some Archduke Chocula.
1, 2, Farnsworth, Ah, Hermes! Crew, meet Hermes Conrad. He manages my delivery business, pays the bills, notifies next of kin, what have you.
1, 2, Hermes, Someone come and dropped this package through the slot last night. Now which one of you is the captain?
1, 2, Farnsworth, Oh, my! I haven't picked a new captain yet. It's always so hard to choose.
1, 2, Fry, Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh!
1, 2, Farnsworth, Hmm, you!
1, 2, Hermes, OK, Captain, this is just a standard legal release protecting Planet Express from lawsuits in the event of the unforeseen.
1, 2, Leela, Death by airlock failure.
1, 2, Hermes, Mm.
1, 2, Leela, Death by brain parasite.
1, 2, Hermes, Yeah.
1, 2, Leela, Death by sonic diarrhoea?
1, 2, Hermes, Oh, you don't want that!
1, 2, Leela, Look, I don't know about any of your previous captains but I intend to do as little dying as possible.
1, 2, Hermes, Sign the paper!
1, 2, Farnsworth, Now, Fry, before you go into space you'll need to see our staff doctor. I should warn you though, he's a little ... unusual.  He wears sandals!
1, 2, Fry, Hi--
1, 2, Farnsworth, Dr. Zoidberg, this is Fry, the new delivery boy. He needs a physical.
1, 2, Zoidberg, Excellent, excellent!
1, 2, Farnsworth, You'll be fine.
1, 2, Zoidberg, Now open your mouth and let's have a look at that brain.  No, no, no, no, no, not that mouth!
1, 2, Fry, I only have one.
1, 2, Zoidberg, Really?
1, 2, Fry, Uh, is there a human doctor around?
1, 2, Zoidberg, Young lady, I'm an expert on humans. Now pick a mouth, open it and say...  What? My mother was a saint! Get out!
1, 2, Farnsworth, Dear Lord, Bender, you're filthy.
1, 2, Bender, Yeah, like you don't have crap in your neck!
1, 2, Farnsworth, Amy, why don't you give his body a going over with the cleaning pick?
1, 2, Amy, OK. Does it hurt when I go like this?
1, 2, Leela, Ow!
1, 2, Bender, A little.
1, 2, Fry, Well, the doctor says I'm as healthy as a crab. Can I go into space now?
1, 2, Farnsworth, As soon as we finish cleaning Bender. Oh, and Fry, this is our intern, Amy Wong. She's an engineering student of mine.  I like having her around because she's the same blood type as me.
1, 2, Amy, Hey! You're the unfrozen guy! From the 20th century, right?
1, 2, Fry, Last time I checked.
1, 2, Leela, Hang on. Amy Wong? Of the Mars Wongs?
1, 2, Amy, Look, we're not as rich as everybody says.
1, 2, Leela, Uh-huh! What sorority do you belong to?
1, 2, Amy, Kappa Kappa Wong.
1, 2, Bender, Hey, rich girl. Look over here! It's me, Bender. I'm being entertaining.   Look at my head. It's all painted! Look at my head! I got a big, old head, hey! Ho!   Alright, show's over, I'm tired.
1, 2, Farnsworth, Ah, to be young again. And also a robot. Now, as I recall, you youngsters have a package to deliver.
1, 2, Fry, Finally! Come on, Bender. Let's mosey!
1, 2, Bender, Nice catch, idiot!
1, 2, Fry, So where are we going anyway?
1, 2, Leela, Nowhere special. The moon.
1, 2, Fry, The moon? The moon moon? Wow! I'm gonna be a famous hero just like Neil Armstrong and those other brave guys no one ever heard of!
1, 2, Amy, Oh, I love stuff like the moon! Can I come, Leela?
1, 2, Leela, Well ... I guess so. Just be careful. I'd like to hold off any major screw-ups until at least my second day as captain.
1, 2, Farnsworth, Nothing will go wrong.   If something goes wrong, bring back the blood.
1, 2, Fry, Can I do the countdown?
1, 2, Leela, Huh? Oh, sure. Knock yourself out.
1, 2, Fry, Ten ...  ... nine--
1, 2, Leela, OK, we're here!
1, 2, Fry, Eightsevensixfivefourthreetwooneblastoff!
1, 2, Fry, Hurry up! I wanna see the moon!
1, 2, Leela, Relax. It's open till 9.
1, 2, Fry, That's one small step for Fry--
1, 2, Man, And one giant line for admission!
1, 2, Fry, Wow!  Um, can I have cuts?
1, 2, Man, Hmm ... no!
1, 2, Fry, You're not gonna believe this but they landed an amusement park on the moon!
1, 2, Amy, Guh! It's the happiest place orbiting Earth.
1, 2, Fry, Let's go, already!
1, 2, Leela, Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
1, 2, Fry, Let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.
1, 2, Bender, Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.
1, 2, Leela, OK, if everyone's finished being stupid--
1, 2, Fry, I had more but you go ahead.
1, 2, Leela, We'll deliver that crate like professionals and then we'll go home.
1, 2, Fry, But I've never been to the moon before.
1, 2, Leela, Alright. We'll deliver that crate like professionals ... and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.  Amy, why don't you help Fry hoist down the crate. Then lock up when you're done. Just be careful.
1, 2, Amy, Aye, aye, Captain! I mean only one eye. I mean, yes, sir-- Um, ma'am!
1, 2, Amy, Clear?
1, 2, Fry, Clear!
1, 2, Amy, Ready to hoist?
1, 2, Fry, Ready!
1, 2, Amy, Ow!
1, 2, Fry, My first space delivery.
1, 2, Fry, Uh, greetings, Moon Man. We come in peace. I am Fry from the planet Earth.
1, 2, Sal, Wise guy, huh? If I wasn't so lazy I'd punch you in the stomach.
1, 2, Fry, But you are lazy, right?
1, 2, Sal, Oh, don't get me started.
1, 2, Craterface, Hi, I'm Craterface! Welcome to Luna Park. I'll have to confiscate your alcohol, sir.
1, 2, Bender, Better mascots than you have tried.
1, 2, Craterface, At least I still have my self respect!
1, 2, Leela, Who buys this trash?
1, 2, Bender, Idiots who need gifts for other idiots.
1, 2, Fry, Hey, I got you guys refrigerator magnets.
1, 2, Bender, Get it off! Get it off! Get it-- Uh-oh!   How many roads must a man walk down, before you--   Keep those things off of me! Magnets screw up my inhibition unit!
1, 2, Fry, So you flip out and start acting like some crazy folk singer?
1, 2, Bender, Yes. I guess a robot would have to be crazy to wanna be a folk singer.
1, 2, Whalerbots, We're whalers on the moon,We carry a harpoon,But there ain't no whales,So we tell our tall tale,And sing our whaling tune!
1, 2, Whalerbot, Bender, hey, Bender! Over here!
1, 2, Bender, Oh, jeez! I went to high school with that guy!
1, 2, Announcer, Monsanto presents
1, 2, Gopher #1, Why does a moon rock taste better than an Earth rock?
1, 2, Gopher #2, Because it's a little meteor!
1, 2, Fry, This is weak!
1, 2, Gopher #1, Address all complaints to the Monsanto corporation.
1, 2, Leela, What's wrong, Fry?
1, 2, Fry, I don't know. This place is great and all but its just so artificial. The gravity, the air, the gophers. You might as well stay on Earth.  That's what I came to see! I wanna go out there and jump around like an astronaut. Screw this phoney stuff!
1, 2, Leela, But the phoney stuff is what's fun. It's boring out there.
1, 2, Bender, Yeah! You're the kind of guy who visits Jerusalem and doesn't want to see the Sexeteria!
1, 2, Leela, Maybe I should take Fry on the Luna Rover ride. You get to wear a space suit and drive around on the surface. And the line's short because it's educational.
1, 2, Fry, I don't care how educational it is. Let's do it!
1, 2, Bender, Next year in Jerusalem!
1, 2, Fry, Finally! Get ready for some serious moon action.
1, 2, Narrator, The story of lunar exploration started with one man. A man with a dream.
1, 2, Ralph Kramden-bot, One of these days, Alice. Bang! Zoom! Straight to the moon!
1, 2, Leela, Wow, I never realised the first astronauts were so fat!
1, 2, Fry, That's not an astronaut, it's a TV comedian. And he was just using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife.
1, 2, Amy, Wow! I could swear I was really playing virtual skeeball!  Hm?
1, 2, Bender, Look, it's that crate we were gonna throw in the sewer.
1, 2, Amy, The keys to the ship!  They must have fallen into the crate! Leela's gonna kill me!
1, 2, Bender, Nah. She'll probably make me do it.
1, 2, Amy, Mister? Could you please get those keys out for me?
1, 2, Sal, What do I look like? A guy who's not lazy?
1, 2, Narrator, No one knows where, when or how Man first landed on the moon.
1, 2, Fry, I do.
1, 2, Narrator, But our fun-gineers think it might have happened something like this
1, 2, Whalerbots, We're whalers on the moon,
1, 2, Gophers, We carry a harpoon,
1, 2, Whalerbots, and   But there ain't no whales so we tell a tall tale...
1, 2, Leela, And sing a whaling tune. We're whalers on the moon--
1, 2, Fry, That's not how it happened.
1, 2, Leela, Oh, really? I don't see you with a fun-gineering degree!
1, 2, Fry, This is stupid. I'm taking this thing out to the real moon.
1, 2, Leela, Fry, no. This is my first mission and I'm not gonna let us get in any trouble. Besides, the car's on a track.
1, 2, Fry, Not for long!
1, 2, Whalerbot, Ooh! Ah! I died doin' what I loved.
1, 2, Leela, OK, you're on the surface. Now I'll give you 10 minutes. Then you'll get bored, turn around and apologise for being such a jerk. Agreed?
1, 2, Fry, Agreed.  Yeah! Crank up the radio!
1, 2, Whalerbots, We're whalers on the--
1, 2, Fry, Yee-haw!
1, 2, Leela, Time's up. Make a U-turn at the next crater.
1, 2, Fry, No, not yet. How 'bout we go look for the original moon landing site?
1, 2, Leela, That's crazy! It's been lost for centuries!
1, 2, Fry, Well I'm feelin' lucky!  Uh ... I'm ready to go back now.
1, 2, Fry, We're gonna die! It's every man for himself!  Help me, Leela!  You did it! We're safe!
1, 2, Leela, No. Now we're gonna die.
1, 2, Fry, It's every man for himself.
1, 2, Bender, Hey, look what I won from a tourist's pocket!
1, 2, Amy, Shut up. You're distracting me.
1, 2, Bender, Come on, it's just like making love. Y'know
1, 2, Amy, I know how to make love!
1, 2, Bender, Here, let me do it.  Ah, lousy arm. Must be rigged!  That's her, officers!  Uh, that's the woman who programmed me for evil!
1, 2, Bender, Yeah, well, I'm gonna go build my own theme park, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the park!
1, 2, Fry, I'm sorry, Leela, I can't go on any further. Just leave me to die in that barn over there.
1, 2, Leela, Thank God!
1, 2, Hydroponic Farmer, Trespassers, eh?
1, 2, Fry, No, sir. We're amusement park patrons.
1, 2, Farmer, Ooh, that's a wicked sinful place. Tilt-a-whirl's OK, but the rest is mighty wicked.
1, 2, Leela, Our car broke down and we're out of oxygen. Can we borrow some?
1, 2, Farmer, Huh, borry? Looky here, city girl, oxygen don't grow on trees. You'll have to earn it doing chores on my hydroponic farm. You can go back to your precious theme park at sun up.
1, 2, Fry, I guess we could do chores for a few hours.
1, 2, Leela, Fry, night lasts two weeks on the moon.
1, 2, Farmer, Yup. Drops down to -173!
1, 2, Fry, Fahrenheit or Celsius?
1, 2, Farmer, First one, then th'other. And them spacesuits ain't a-heated so you ain't goin' nowhere till sunrise. You can sleep in the barn. Just don't be a-touchin' my three beautiful robot daughters. Y'hear?
1, 2, Fry, Robot daughters?
1, 2, Farmer, This here is Lulabelle 7.
1, 2, Lulabelle 7, Yoo-hoo!
1, 2, Farmer, Daisy-Mae 128K.
1, 2, Daisy-Mae 128K, Yoo-hoo!
1, 2, Farmer, And the Crushinator.
1, 2, Crushinator, Yoo-hoo.
1, 2, Fry, Whoa!
1, 2, Leela, I told you to turn around and go back to the park. But oh, no, the park was too phoney. We had to see the real moon.
1, 2, Fry, And it was great! We got to see craters and rocks and that one incredible rock that looked like a crater and ... and these fellas.
1, 2, Leela, Fry, face it
1, 2, Fry, I guess I can't.
1, 2, Farmer, I'll learn ye to sleep with my robot daughters!
1, 2, Bender, He'll never find me in here.
1, 2, Leela, Bender?
1, 2, Fry, Oh, Bender. You didn't touch the Crushinator, did you?
1, 2, Bender, Of course not. A lady that fine you gotta romance first.
1, 2, Farmer, Oh, no you don't! C'mere, Crushinator.
1, 2, Crushinator, Yes, Pa.
1, 2, Fry, It's too low.
1, 2, Leela, Hang on. Hang on. Jump!  Hold on to your helmet!
1, 2, Farmer, God darn it, Crushinator, jump!
1, 2, Crushinator, No, Pa. I love him.
1, 2, Fry, Hey, cool! Dark side of the moon!
1, 2, Leela, Nightfall's coming.  Hurry, before we freeze.
1, 2, Bender, What do you mean we, mammal?
1, 2, Farnsworth, Oh, dear! I really ought to do something. But I am already in my pyjamas.
1, 2, Leela, We can't outrun it forever.
1, 2, Fry, Over there! Look! It's the moon landing site! We found it!
1, 2, Leela, Quick, get in.
1, 2, Fry, It's that flag from MTV! And Neil Armstrong's footprint!  Hey! My foot's bigger! Leela, isn't this the greatest thing you've ever seen?
1, 2, Leela, Fry, look around. It's just a crummy plastic flag and a dead man's tracks in the dust.  Now get in here before you freeze.
1, 2, Bender, Oh, no room for Bender, huh? Fine! I'll go build my own lunar lander, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the lunar lander and the blackjack. Ah, screw the whole thing.
1, 2, Leela, Well if the oxygen holds out we might live long enough to starve to death.
1, 2, Fry, Look, Leela, I'm sorry. I never should have dragged you out here.
1, 2, Leela, That's right, you shouldn't have. I still don't get what the big attraction is.
1, 2, Fry, I never told anybody this but a thousand years ago I used to look up at the moon and dream about being an astronaut. I just didn't have the grades. Nor the physical endurance. Plus I threw up a lot and nobody liked spending a week with me.
1, 2, Leela, A week would be a little much.
1, 2, Fry, The moon was like this awesome, romantic, mysterious thing, hanging up there in the sky where you could never reach it, no matter how much you wanted to.  But you're right. Once you're actually here it's just a big dull rock. I guess I just wanted you to see it through my eyes, the way I used to.
1, 2, Leela, Fry, look. . It really is beautiful. I don't know why I never noticed before.
1, 2, Farmer, Had to come back for the Crushinator, eh, robot? Well I got you this time.
1, 2, Fry, It's Amy! We're saved!
1, 2, Leela, Amy? Where'd she learn to operate the controls like that?
1, 2, Bender, Not the magnet! No! No! No--  Uh-oh!
1, 2, Bender, She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes,She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes-- I'll kill you Amy! She'll be comin' round the mountain,She'll be comin' round the mountain,She'll be comin'--
1, 2, Farmer, Aw, dang it!
1, 2, Bender, She'll be riding six white horses when she comes,She'll be riding six white horses when she comes-- Hey, I'm pretty good! She'll be riding six white horses...
1, 2, Leela, So, Fry, was the real moon anything like the moon you used to dream about?
1, 2, Fry, Well ... close enough!
1, 2, Bender, Well I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun,Oh, I'll shoot her with my ray gun,Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,When she comes!I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world,I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world, I'll be blastin' all the humans, I'll be blastin' all the humans, I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world,In the world! One more time!
1, 3, Bender, Hey!
1, 3, Hermes, Fry, mon, if you're going to be living in the office you could at least be on time for work.
1, 3, Fry, I'm sorry. I was up really late poking through people's desks.
1, 3, Hermes, Alright, people. I will now outline today's 12-point agenda. We'll begin with point one, then race forward--
1, 3, Hermes, Concerning our pest problem
1, 3, Leela, What the hell are you doing? You're getting a huge dose of radiation!
1, 3, Fry, And great lift!
1, 3, Leela, Do you know how long it's going to take me to recalibrate these engines?
1, 3, Fry, Hey! When you look this good, you don't have to know anything.
1, 3, Leela, Professor, We need to talk to you about Fry.
1, 3, Bender, That's right, we want some money— Wait. What's this about Fry?
1, 3, Leela, He's a nice guy but we think it's about time he got his own place.
1, 3, Farnsworth, Oh, fuff! He's not causing any trouble. Now, if you don't mind, I'm rather busy. I seem to have mislaid my alien mummy.  This sarcophagus should contain the remains of Emperor Nimballa, who ruled Zuban 5 over 29 million years ago.
1, 3, Fry, Hey, Professor, great jerky!
1, 3, Farnsworth, My God, this is an outrage! I was going to eat that mummy! Fry has got to go!
1, 3, Announcer, Bachelor Chow, now with flavour!
1, 3, Commentator, And Bigfoot is down!
1, 3, Fry, Sheesh! 40,000 channels and only 150 have anything good on.
1, 3, Announcer, All My Circuits is brought to you by Robo Fresh
1, 3, Calculon, I've been processing this for some time, Monique, and, well, will you marry me?
1, 3, Monique, Oh, Calculon!  It fits! Then you must know that I'm--
1, 3, Calculon, Metric? I've always known. But for you, my darling, I'm willing to convert.
1, 3, Fry, Hmm, must be a friend of theirs.
1, 3, Bender, Fry, we've got to discuss your living arrangements.
1, 3, Leela, We've all talked it over and--
1, 3, Bender, Hey, All My Circuits! Move over.
1, 3, Leela, Fry, sometimes in close quarters, people do inconsiderate things without realising it.
1, 3, Fry, I know but I forgive you.
1, 3, Leela, No, Fry, by close quarters I mean this office--
1, 3, Fry, Uh-huh.
1, 3, Leela, And by people I mean you!
1, 3, Fry, Right.
1, 3, Leela, And by inconsiderate I mean--
1, 3, Fry, Leela! We're trying to watch TV.
1, 3, Bender, Yeah. Would you kindly shut your noise hole?
1, 3, Fry, So, who's that weird-looking guy?
1, 3, Bender, That's a human.
1, 3, Fry, What's he do?
1, 3, Bender, Eh, the usual human stuff. He laughs, he learns, he loves.
1, 3, Fry, Boring!
1, 3, Human Friend, Calculon? I thought you were in a coma.
1, 3, Calculon, That's what I wanted you to think with your soft, human brain.
1, 3, Fry, Hey, uh, why is the TV getting smaller?
1, 3, Hermes, We'll bill you for the couch.
1, 3, Bender, Cheer up, meatbag. You've barely touched your amoeba.
1, 3, Fry, It looked good but I just don't feel like eating. You want it?
1, 3, Bender, Nah, I'm trying to watch my input. I need plenty of wholesome, nutritious alcohol.  The chemical energy keeps my fuel cells charged.
1, 3, Fry, What are the cigars for?
1, 3, Bender, They make me look cool.
1, 3, Fry, I can't believe they threw me out like that. I must have been really acting like a jerk.
1, 3, Bender, Yeah, but everybody's a jerk. You, me, this jerk.  That's my philosophy. So, where you gonna stay?
1, 3, Fry, I don't know. Do refrigerators still come in cardboard boxes?
1, 3, Bender, Yeah, but the rents are outrageous. Why don't you just come move in with me?
1, 3, Fry, Really? That'd be great! You sure I won't be imposing?
1, 3, Bender, Nah, I've always wanted a pet.
1, 3, Bender, Here we are. Your new home.
1, 3, Fry, Cool! Y'know, I've never even seen a robot's apartment before.
1, 3, Bender, Come on in, I'll give you the tour!
1, 3, Bender, Let's see, where to start. OK, this is the TV area, that over there's the breakfast nook, and over here is where you'll be living which is great because, until now, it's just been wasted space.
1, 3, Fry, It's kinda cramped in here. I don't even have room to hang my clothes.
1, 3, Bender, Look, pal, you've only got one set of clothes and you're not taking them off while I'm here. Well, I'm bushed. G'night.
1, 3, Fry, Wait, Bender. Bender?
1, 3, Bender, Kill all humans ... kill all humans ... must kill all the humans.
1, 3, Fry, Bender, wake up!
1, 3, Bender, I was having the most wonderful dream. I think you were in it.
1, 3, Fry, Uh, listen, Bender. Uh, where's your bathroom?
1, 3, Bender, Bath what?
1, 3, Fry, Bathroom.
1, 3, Bender, What room?
1, 3, Fry, Bathroom!
1, 3, Bender, What what?
1, 3, Fry, Ah, never mind!
1, 3, Bender, Hey, sexy mama, wanna kill all the humans?
1, 3, Leela, We sure are cheerful this morning.
1, 3, Bender, Yeah, this past week with Fry's been a blast! Y'know, beneath this warm, sunny exterior beats the cold, mechanical heart of a robot.
1, 3, Leela, What happened to you?
1, 3, Fry, Oh, it's Bender's apartment. He put in carpeting yesterday so now my head hits the ceiling. Hey, do you realise you're standing at a weird angle?  Now you're OK.
1, 3, Leela, Look at yourself. You're a wreck! You've got to find a new place to live.
1, 3, Fry, Is that an invitation?
1, 3, Leela, Love your optimism, Fry. But seriously, you've got to tell Bender you're moving out.
1, 3, Fry, Yeah, but he might get kind of upset. I don't think I can do that to him.
1, 3, Bender, Hey, there's my little space heater.
1, 3, Fry, Well, I'm moving out!
1, 3, Bender, What?
1, 3, Fry, I'm sorry, Bender, but there's just not enough room.
1, 3, Bender, Not enough room? My place is two cubic metres and we only take up 1.5 cubic metres. We've got room for a-whole-nother two-thirds of a person.
1, 3, Leela, What if I just helped the two of you find a bigger apartment?
1, 3, Bender, I don't know. I've got a lot of great memories in my old place.  And now they're gone.
1, 3, Underwater house salesman, Sure, it ain't one of them la-de-da above-ground places. But if you like dank, hey, forget about it!
1, 3, Leela, At least it's got a great view.
1, 3, Bender, What the--?
1, 3, Underwater House Salesman, Excuse me. I gotta go change a lightbulb.
1, 3, Leela, Wow! Now this is fantastic!
1, 3, Fry, Hmm. I'm not sure we want to pay for a dimension we're not going to use.
1, 3, Fry, Well, I give up. What's the catch?
1, 3, Suspiciously fantastic apartment salesman, Oh, no catch. Although we 'are technically in New Jersey.
1, 3, Fry, Not one place even remotely liveable.
1, 3, Farnsworth, Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? To shreds, you say. Very well then.  Sad, sad, terrible, gruesome news about my colleague, Dr. Mbutu.
1, 3, Leela, Was his apartment rent-controlled?
1, 3, Leela, Wow. This is beautiful.
1, 3, Bender, What's with all the crap?
1, 3, Leela, It's not crap.
1, 3, Hattie, Dr. Mbutu collected this crap while he was exploring the watcha-call-it ... universe!
1, 3, Fry, Well, this place has everything except the only thing I care about
1, 3, Hattie, It's got a TV, you young watcha-call-it ... idiot!
1, 3, Fry, Ooh!
1, 3, Bender, Whoa, slow down! This place just doesn't feel like home. It just isn't ... cosy.  Ah. I can barely move!  (from inside) It's perfect!
1, 3, Fry, Man, it's a total sty! For the first time in a thousand years, I feel like I'm home.
1, 3, Bender, Yeah! It's gonna be fun on the bun! Y'know, Fry, of all the friends I've had, you're the first.
1, 3, Hermes, Hey, mon!
1, 3, Leela, Happy housewarming, Fry!  It's a miniature fruit salad tree.
1, 3, Fry, Ooh!  Hey, Amy!
1, 3, Amy, Hey!
1, 3, Farnsworth, This is for you, Fry  Zevulon the Great. He's teriyaki style.
1, 3, Bender, Wow! Heavy-drinking crowd!  I'd better go out for more beer.
1, 3, Fry, Hey, hang on, All My Circuits is about to start!
1, 3, Bender, I know, but I need alcohol to power up my batteries. If Calculon's wedding doesn't go just right I'll be emotionally and electrically drained.
1, 3, Fry, Hey!
1, 3, Hermes, These are mighty tasty!
1, 3, Zoidberg, Thank you. I made them myself.
1, 3, Fry, Sh! The wedding's about to start!
1, 3, Preacherbot, If anyone here objects to this union, let them speak now or forever hold their—
1, 3, Fry, Is he objecting or backing up?
1, 3, Amy, Looks like both.
1, 3, Calculon, I'm afraid my half-brother is correct. You see, I have a terrible secret and that secret is--
1, 3, Amy, Oh, this isn't right.
1, 3, Hermes, Oh, come on!
1, 3, Farnsworth, Fix it!
1, 3, Bender, Hey, what happened to the TV?
1, 3, Fry, It just went out.
1, 3, Bender, This is an outrage! I'm gonna go yell at the manager!
1, 3, Hermes, Alright!
1, 3, Fry, Come back, Bender! It's working!
1, 3, Calculon, To reiterate, my terrible secret is--
1, 3, Fry, It's out again.
1, 3, Bender, What? That's the last straw!
1, 3, Fry, It's back on!
1, 3, Hattie, Pardon me. I don't mean to pry into what you're doing in here with the crab and the one-eyed lady and the Chinese girl but everyone on this floor is having trouble with their TV reception.
1, 3, Bender, Yeah! And you'd better get rid of whatever's causing it or we're outta this dump!
1, 3, Hattie, Relax, sonny. This kajigger'll find the source of the interference.
1, 3, Tenant #1, What's going on?
1, 3, Tenant #2, We want our TV back!
1, 3, Hattie, There's your problem.
1, 3, Amy, Oh, my God! Bender, it's your thingy!
1, 3, Randy, Then get rid of it!
1, 3, Tenant #1, Get out!
1, 3, Bender, You people are nuts. My antenna never interfered with my old TV.
1, 3, Leela, You had cable. This is satellite.
1, 3, Farnsworth, Obviously your thoughts are being transmitted on the same frequency.
1, 3, Huge-assed woman, They're on my cell phone too.
1, 3, Bender, Madam, I believe you're mistaken!
1, 3, Bender, Wow, that lady's got a huge ass!
1, 3, Bender, Those could be anyone's thoughts, fat ass!
1, 3, Randy, The robot has to go!
1, 3, Tenant #1, Yeah.
1, 3, Tenant #3, Get him out of here!
1, 3, Hattie, Well, you heard the mob!
1, 3, Bender, Fine! Come on, Fry, let's move to that apartment that smelled like a sewer. You liked that one, right?
1, 3, Fry, It's tempting, but, well, I am already kinda settled in here.
1, 3, Bender, Or we could live underground with the mutants. A little fire'll show 'em who's boss!
1, 3, Fry, Uh, listen, is there maybe some way we could do this with you going and me not going?
1, 3, Bender, I don't understand.
1, 3, Fry, Well, you were gonna live in the closet anyway. Won't you be just as happy back in your old place?
1, 3, Bender, But, then we wouldn't be roommates.
1, 3, Fry, I'll come visit sometime. And you can visit me here.
1, 3, Hattie, No he can't.
1, 3, Fry, Anyway, I'm sure it'll work out. This way we'll both be happy.
1, 3, Bender, Happy. Yeah, that's Bender. Always happy.
1, 3, Randy, Hey, the TV's back on!
1, 3, Preacherbot, We are gathered here to mourn the death of Calculon; industrialist, private eye, friend.
1, 3, Calculon, Mind if I give the eulogy?
1, 3, Monique, Calculon! You're alive!
1, 3, Randy, Calculon's back!
1, 3, Farnsworth, Right, so long.
1, 3, Zoidberg, Goodbye.
1, 3, Amy, Do you think Calculon's evil twin will ever walk again?
1, 3, Hermes, I don't know, Amy. I just don't know.
1, 3, Fry, Hey, thanks for coming.
1, 3, Leela, Fry, you're Bender's best friend. How could you let that mob kick him out?
1, 3, Fry, Ah, come on. Bender loves mobs.
1, 3, Leela, Only when he's in them and you know it. You really hurt his feelings.
1, 3, Fry, Don't girl me with that girl stuff. Bender and me are guys. Guys don't have feelings.
1, 3, Leela, Bender's not a guy, he's a robot.
1, 3, Fry, Same thing.
1, 3, Bender, It's so big and empty.
1, 3, Bender, My roommate's gone. And all he left behind was an eyelash and three skin flakes.  Oh, what's the point?
1, 3, Leela, Bender?  My God, you're a mess!
1, 3, Bender, Leave me alone!
1, 3, Leela, Look at that five o'clock rust. You've been up all night not drinking, haven't you?
1, 3, Bender, Hey. What I don't do is none of your business.
1, 3, Leela, Please, Bender. Have some malt liquor. If not for yourself then for the people who love you.
1, 3, Bender, I hate the people who love me and they hate me.
1, 3, Leela, Oh, now look. It's obvious you miss being Fry's roommate. But there's got to be a better way to deal with this.
1, 3, Bender, Like how? Having my antenna removed?
1, 3, Leela, Well, if that would work.
1, 3, Bender, Are you crazy? That's Little Bender you're talking about. I can't cut it off. You're not a robot or a man so you wouldn't understand. I gotta get out of here.
1, 3, Leela, Wait! I want you to look me in the eye and promise you won't get behind the wheel without some kind of alcoholic beverage in your hand.
1, 3, Bender, I promise nothing!
1, 3, Fry, What up?
1, 3, Leela, I can't just stand by and be silent about Bender anymore.
1, 3, Fry, Silent? You've been meddling for two solid weeks.
1, 3, Leela, Well I can't just do that anymore. Your best friend is out there somewhere destroying himself.
1, 3, Fry, Really? I didn't think he'd miss this apartment that much.
1, 3, Leela, He doesn't care about the apartment, he cares about you. And you turned your back on him.
1, 3, Fry, Oh, man. I had no idea. If only I knew where he was I'd go talk to him.
1, 3, Fry, Oh, stupid TV!  Bender! You're blind-stinking sober!
1, 3, Bender, That's right! I'm sober and crazy and I don't know what I might do!
1, 3, Fry, Don't do it!
1, 3, Bender, I don't know what it is yet. Oh, yeah, now I remember. I thought I could live alone, but I can't. So, I'm gonna do what it takes to be your roommate again.
1, 3, Leela, Bender! Stop!
1, 3, Fry, Cutting Leela's head off won't solve anything!
1, 3, Bender, No, I'm going to chop off my antenna.
1, 3, Fry, Hey, yeah! That sounds good. Can I give you a hand?
1, 3, Leela, Fry! Don't help him mutilate himself.
1, 3, Fry, But it's a useless antenna. It's not like he's a ham radio or something.
1, 3, Bender, I'm gonna do it! I'm really gonna do it! Don't try and stop me! Here goes.
1, 3, Fry, Hey, it works! The static's gone.
1, 3, Human Friend, I hate that this came between us, Calculon.
1, 3, Calculon, Me too. I'm filled with a large number of powerful emotions.
1, 3, Human Friend, You're my best friend. I'm sorry I treated you so badly.
1, 3, Calculon, Apology accepted. After all, you're only human.
1, 3, Leela, You guys could learn a lesson from those two.
1, 3, Fry, She's right.
1, 3, Bender, You're my best friend, Fry, I'm sorry I treated you so badly.
1, 3, Fry, Apology accepted. After all, you're only human.
1, 3, Leela, Wait a minute! You did it all backwards.  Fry's the one who should be--  Oh, never mind!
1, 3, Fry, What's wrong?
1, 3, Bender, Nothing. I guess I'm just going to have to get used to being half a robot.
1, 3, Fry, Aw, this isn't right. Listen, Bender, if we found your antenna could they still reattach it?
1, 3, Bender, Maybe. If we get it on ice right away.
1, 3, Smitty, Bingo!
1, 3, URL, You call that an antenna?
1, 3, Bender, This time, you'll have all the human comfort. We'll get a couple of toilets, some food cookers, maybe a puppy.
1, 3, Fry, It's good to be home.
1, 3, Bender, It sure is. By the way, I saved your stuff.
1, 3, Fry, So that's where those skin flakes went. Hmm, do you think this fruit tree's going to get enough light?
1, 3, Bender, There's a window in the closet.
1, 3, Fry, This is huge! Bender, why don't I just live in here?
1, 3, Bender, In a closet? Oh, humans!
1, 4, Leela, This place was a great choice. The food is amazing. And such generous portions.
1, 4, Doug, You like the meal just wait until you try these after-dinner mints.
1, 4, Leela, You know, Doug, most guys are put off by my eye. It's nice to finally meet someone who's open-minded.  Ew!
1, 4, Fry, What was wrong with your date last night?
1, 4, Leela, I don't know. Something I couldn't quite put my finger on. Possibly his vile lizard tongue.
1, 4, Amy, You're too picky.
1, 4, Fry, Yeah. If you rule out every guy with a lizard tongue or a low I.Q. or an explosive violent temper, of course you're gonna be lonely.
1, 4, Leela, There's nothing wrong with having high standards. Now can we please stop--
1, 4, Zoidberg, The female Leela's problem is purely medical. Soon she will drop her eggs and they will hatch and all will be well.
1, 4, Amy, You just have to give guys a chance. Sometimes you meet a guy and think he's a pig, but then later you realise he actually has a really good body.
1, 4, Leela, Thank you all for the inspiring advice, but I'm perfectly happy with my life the way it is.
1, 4, Bender, That sounds like a cry for help.
1, 4, Amy, Let's all take her out tonight. There's lots of great places to meet people.
1, 4, Hermes, The Federal Sex Bureau.
1, 4, Bender, A saucy puppet show.
1, 4, Zoidberg, The rotting carcass of a whale.
1, 4, Amy, Hmm, I'll pick!
1, 4, Amy, Oh, wow! It's totally retro!
1, 4, Fry, Why's everyone wearing those rings?
1, 4, Amy, Guh! Because nobody wears them anymore! Rings are stupid!
1, 4, Fry, I think they look cool.
1, 4, Amy, Sh! Don't let anyone hear you say that!
1, 4, Man, Hey, did that guy just say rings are cool?
1, 4, Amy, Nope, he said they're stupid.
1, 4, Man, Cool!
1, 4, Amy, So what do you think of that guy by the bar?
1, 4, Leela, I don't know. Maybe?
1, 4, Bender, Forget it, he's gay.
1, 4, Leela, What? How can you tell?
1, 4, Bender, I just know these things. I've got what they call gaydar.
1, 4, Leela, There's no such thing.
1, 4, Bender, No?  OK, I got a lock on him.  Yep! He's gay!
1, 4, Amy, Are you sure?
1, 4, Bender, Definitely. Unless I'm getting interference from a gay weather balloon.
1, 4, 21st-century girl, You're from the 20th century? That's incredible! I'm from the 21st century.
1, 4, Fry, No way! We've got so much in common.
1, 4, 21st-century girl, We sure do. Remember when those cyborgs enslaved humanity?
1, 4, Fry, Uh, yeah! That rings a bell.
1, 4, Amy, This is Bolt Rolands. Bolt is a hyper-sled racer with 10 wins on the pro-circuit.
1, 4, Bolt, Hello, beautiful!
1, 4, Bender, I think she means 10 wins on the gay circuit.
1, 4, Bolt, I wish! Those cats can really fly.
1, 4, Amy, This is M5438, an entity of pure energy.
1, 4, Leela, That's great, really, but he's just not what I'm looking for.
1, 4, M-5438, I understand. One day you will evolve beyond your physical body, and on that day I hope you will pick up the phone.
1, 4, Amy, You're impossible.
1, 4, Bender, Just as well; I think he comes from a dimension that's big on musical theatre.
1, 4, Fry, Pst. I need the apartment tonight. Go see a saucy puppet show.
1, 4, Bender, Can do!
1, 4, The Hip Joint janitor, My, my, my! What's a beautiful lady like you—  Oh, my! Eurgh! I'm sorry, I thought you had two eyes.
1, 4, Bender, So, Leela, you must have had your pick of the litter last night at closing time.
1, 4, Leela, Could you guys please stop talking about my personal life?
1, 4, Farnsworth, Yes, let's all talk about Leela's personal life later. But right now we have business to attend to.
1, 4, Fry, A delivery?
1, 4, Farnsworth, No. A tax-deductible mission of charity.
1, 4, Computer Voice, This is Vergon 6.
1, 4, Farnsworth, This is Vergon 6.
1, 4, Amy, Buh!
1, 4, Farnsworth, It's a sunny little doomed planet, inhabited by a number of frisky little doomed animals.
1, 4, Leela, Animals?
1, 4, Farnsworth, That's right. Animals in desperate need of rescue. You see, Vergon 6 was once filled with a super-dense substance known as dark matter, each pound of which weighs over ten thousand  pounds.
1, 4, Leela, Wait! What about the animals?
1, 4, Farnsworth, Well, dark matter is extremely valuable as starship fuel. That's why it was all mined out, leaving the planet completely hollow.
1, 4, Leela, Yes, but what about the animals?
1, 4, Farnsworth, The wha?
1, 4, Leela, The animals.
1, 4, Farnsworth, I didn't say anything about animals. Now it seems that the planet will collapse within three days. Incidentally, this will kill all the animals.
1, 4, Leela, So we have to bring back two of each kind. Just like Noah's Ark.
1, 4, Bender, Why two?  Oh!
1, 4, Fry, I bet you Leela's holding out for a nice guy with one eye.
1, 4, Bender, That'll take forever. What she oughta do is find a nice guy with two eyes, then poke one out.
1, 4, Fry, Yeah, that'd be a timesaver.
1, 4, Leela, Do you mind?
1, 4, Bender, Here you go.  You can use this as an eye-poker.
1, 4, Leela, Thank you. But I don't care how many eyes a man has ... as long as it's less than five. All I'm looking for is a guy who's adventurous, self-confident...
1, 4, Leela, ...maybe a snappy dresser.
1, 4, Zapp, These new uniforms are pretty snappy, eh, first officer?
1, 4, Kif, I suppose, Captain. I'm not as big a fan of velour as you are. Now what do you want to do about that unidentified ship?
1, 4, Zapp, Destroy them!  Mmm! That's got a nice feel to it.
1, 4, Zapp, Captain's journal
1, 4, Kif, Who are you talking to, sir?
1, 4, Zapp, You! Aren't you getting this?  We have detected a vessel attempting to break the security cordon around Vergon 6. I'm anticipating an all-out tactical dogfight, followed by a light dinner ... ravioli, ham, sundae bar.
1, 4, Leela, Hey, look! That's Zapp Brannigan's ship.
1, 4, Fry, Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?
1, 4, Leela, Uh-huh!
1, 4, Fry, Who's the Zapp Brannigan?
1, 4, Kif, Shall I fire on them now, sir?
1, 4, Zapp, Not yet, Kif. In the game of chess, you can never let your adversary see your pieces.  What?
1, 4, Leela, They say Zapp Brannigan single-handedly saved the Octillian System from a horde of rampaging Killbots.
1, 4, Fry, Wow!
1, 4, Bender, A grim day for robot-kind. Ah, but we can always build more Killbots!
1, 4, Leela, He's the most decorated captain in the whole Democratic Order of Planets.
1, 4, Fry, Leela's got a boyfriend!
1, 4, Leela, No I don't. But I think we ought to meet with him and see if he'll help us rescue those animals.
1, 4, Bender, Well, just in case you guys hit it off, you'll wanna take this with you.
1, 4, Kif, Sir, they're headed straight for us.
1, 4, Zapp, A well-calculated move straight out of Sun Tzu's classic text The Art Of War, or my own masterwork
1, 4, Kif, Sir, they've docked with us and have come aboard.
1, 4, Zapp, Then I have risked all and lost. Kif, old man, I'll be in the escape pod.  If that wicker chair I like survives the slaughter, have it sent to my P.O. box.
1, 4, Leela, Hello, I'm Leela, captain of the Planet Express delivery ship. We've come aboard to plead for your assistance.
1, 4, Kif, Well, if there's anything--
1, 4, Zapp, I'm in command here. Zapp Brannigan. Has my fame preceded me or was I too quick for you?
1, 4, Leela, Oh, not at all. I'm just so, uh, really thrilled to meet you!
1, 4, Zapp, You're an impressive piece of captain. Beautiful and deadly -- a potent combination.
1, 4, Leela, You don't mean that!
1, 4, Zapp, But I do. I doubt I've seen more than three or four captains sexier than you, and only one who was deadlier.
1, 4, Fry, I heard that one time you single-handedly defeated a horde of rampaging somethings in the something-something-system.
1, 4, Zapp, The Killbots? A trifle! It was simply a matter of outsmarting them.
1, 4, Fry, Wow! I never would have thought of that!
1, 4, Zapp, You see, Killbots have a preset kill limit. Knowing their weakness, I sent wave after wave of my own men at them, until they reached their limit and shutdown. Kif, show them the medal I won.
1, 4, Zapp, More, please.  A little more ... more ... keep going.
1, 4, Leela, Captain Brannigan, we really need to talk to you about our mission.
1, 4, Zapp, Whatever it is, I'm willing to put wave after wave of men at your disposal. Right, men?
1, 4, Crewman, You suck!
1, 4, Leela, We're hoping to save the animals of Vergon 6 from extinction. And if you could just--
1, 4, Zapp, Vergon 6? This light dinner is over.
1, 4, Leela, Wait! What's wrong?
1, 4, Zapp, The Democratic Order of Planets prohibits interfering with undeveloped worlds. It's a little rule known as Brannigan's Law.
1, 4, Leela, But people already interfered. That planet was mined completely hollow.
1, 4, Zapp, Yes, by a Democratic Order of Planets mining crew.
1, 4, Leela, This doesn't make any sense.
1, 4, Zapp, I don't pretend to understand Brannigan's Law. I merely enforce it.
1, 4, Leela, Fine! We'll save the animals without your help.
1, 4, Zapp, I'm afraid I can't allow that. Guards!
1, 4, Fry, What just happened?
1, 4, Bender, He's throwing us in prison.
1, 4, Fry, Dang! Can I get this wrapped up?
1, 4, Leela, Ow! I might've liked Zapp Brannigan if he weren't a pompous dimwit who threw me in prison.
1, 4, Bender, You really are too picky.
1, 4, Zapp, Kif, follow me up to the observation deck. I've got some musing to do.
1, 4, Kif, Oh, jeez!
1, 4, Zapp, I'm facing a formidable female adversary, Kif. Suggestions?
1, 4, Kif, I fail to see any problem, sir. You already imprisoned her under directive B-10.8-1.
1, 4, Zapp, You mean Brannigan's Law?
1, 4, Kif, Right, that law.
1, 4, Zapp, Which one?
1, 4, Kif, Brannigan's Law.
1, 4, Zapp, Kif, you're my best and most loyal friend but you've earned my contempt once again. As my protégé you should know that the only way to deal with a female adversary is to seduce her.  This time we are sure she's a woman, right?
1, 4, Kif, Yes.
1, 4, Zapp, Good! Invite her to my quarters. Oh, and have the boy lay out my formal shorts.
1, 4, Kif, The boy, sir?
1, 4, Zapp, You. You lay out my formal shorts.
1, 4, Kif, The jackass wants to see you in his quarters.
1, 4, Leela, Good. This will be my chance to reason with him, captain to captain.
1, 4, Kif, And he wants you to wear this.
1, 4, Zapp, Come and get it!
1, 4, Zapp, Welcome to my humble chamber, or as I call it, the Lovenasium. Sham-pag-in?
1, 4, Leela, I didn't realise you were such a coin-a-sewer.
1, 4, Zapp, Well I have studied abroad. Or two!
1, 4, Leela, Captain--
1, 4, Zapp, Uh-huh?
1, 4, Leela, If we could speak seriously for a moment--
1, 4, Zapp, Uh-huh?
1, 4, Leela, I'd like you to reconsider letting us rescue those animals.
1, 4, Zapp, Mm-hm.  I like your style. I find it very... (whispering) erotic.
1, 4, Leela, What?
1, 4, Zapp, Erotic!
1, 4, Fry, We can definitely escape, Bender. All you have to do is bend the hatch off this steam pipe.
1, 4, Bender, Hey, yeah!
1, 4, Fry, No good! It's full of steam!
1, 4, Zapp, You look like a woman who enjoys the finer things. Come over here and feel my velour bedspread.
1, 4, Leela, I'm not really in the mood.
1, 4, Zapp, Leela, it's real velour. Just let yourself go.
1, 4, Leela, Can I please just go back to prison?
1, 4, Zapp, You'd rather sit in prison than spend one evening with the Zapper?
1, 4, Leela, Much rather!  What are you doing?
1, 4, Zapp, Oh, God, I'm pathetic. Sorry. Just go. You want the rest of the sham-pag-in?
1, 4, Leela, No. And it's pronounced sham-pane.
1, 4, Zapp, Oh, God, no!
1, 4, Leela, It's not a big deal.
1, 4, Zapp, I get so lonely. I just thought you, a fellow captain, would understand.
1, 4, Leela, Oh, forget it.
1, 4, Zapp, Yeah, it's great ordering people around and stuff but through it all you're completely alone.
1, 4, Leela, It comes with the job.
1, 4, Zapp, I'm just so lonely!
1, 4, Leela, Oh, come on. Cheer up. It's not that bad.
1, 4, Fry, You wanna try escaping again?
1, 4, Bender, Nah, I'm comfy.
1, 4, Fry, Man, Leela's been gone a long time. I hope she's at least making progress with Zapp Brannigan.
1, 4, Zapp, Good morning, lover.
1, 4, Leela, Uh, listen, Zapp.
1, 4, Zapp, Now you're officially my woman. Kudos! I can't say I don't envy you.
1, 4, Leela, Zapp, last night was a mistake.
1, 4, Zapp, A sexy mistake.
1, 4, Leela, No, just a regular mistake. For a split second my common sense was overwhelmed by pity.
1, 4, Zapp, A split second is all it takes. That's why sooner or later you'll come crawling back to the Zapper.
1, 4, Leela, The only kind of crawling I'm doing to you is away ... from!
1, 4, Zapp, Leela, you're obviously confused and aroused.
1, 4, Leela, Look, I'm going down to Vergon 6 to save those animals whether you like it or not.
1, 4, Zapp, Go ahead. I won't stop you.
1, 4, Leela, Threaten all you-- Wait. What?
1, 4, Zapp, We both know you won't make it halfway to Vergon 6 before the craving sets in. Then you'll come crawling back for another taste of sweet, sweet candy ... bam!
1, 4, Leela, Eurgh!
1, 4, Zapp, Kif!
1, 4, Kif, Yes--  Yes, Captain?
1, 4, Zapp, I have made it with a woman. Inform the men.
1, 4, Kif, The fatso says you're free to go.
1, 4, Fry, Really? Why?
1, 4, Kif, Why indeed.
1, 4, Fry, What does that mean?
1, 4, Leela, Nothing.
1, 4, Bender, So should we get our stuff and head down to the planet?
1, 4, Leela, We just talked, OK?!
1, 4, Leela, Alright, we don't have much time to collect these animals. The planet is supposed to collapse in approximately two hours ago.
1, 4, Leela, Hello, there.  Hmm. He doesn't seem to be on the checklist.
1, 4, Bender, So, you're saying we can cook him?
1, 4, Fry, Yeah, a barbecue! I'll wear my hilarious apron.
1, 4, Leela, No! I don't care how hilarious your apron is, we're not cooking him.  Aww! I'll call him Nibbler.
1, 4, Bender, Aww! (whispering to Fry) I'll fire up the grill!
1, 4, Leela, I hope he'll be OK in there with all those big animals.
1, 4, Zapp, Y'know, Kif, once my woman returns I won't have much time to hang out with the boys anymore.
1, 4, Kif, That's a shame, sir.
1, 4, Zapp, So let's make the most of our time together, shall we?  Never mind. Just give me a back rub.
1, 4, Bender, I found a pair of hermaphlamingos.
1, 4, Leela, Good. That's the last species.
1, 4, Bender, Hey. What the--?
1, 4, Fry, Where'd they all go?
1, 4, Leela, Nibbler!
1, 4, Fry, I can't believe we flew halfway across the galaxy and enjoyed a steam just to get lunch for that stupid animal!
1, 4, Bender, He's pending for a bending.
1, 4, Leela, Leave him alone. It's not his fault that he's an unstoppable killing machine. Is it, snoogums?
1, 4, Fry, The planet's kerploding!
1, 4, Leela, Prepare for lift-off.  We're out of fuel. Bender, I told you to fill the tank before we left.
1, 4, Bender, Yeah, I'll do it when we get back.
1, 4, Fry, Man, lucky for us Zapp Brannigan's nearby.
1, 4, Leela, No way! Forget it! I refuse to go crawling back to him!
1, 4, Fry, What? What are you talking about?
1, 4, Leela, Nothing. We just talked.
1, 4, Bender, So what's your problem? It's not like you slept with him.  Oh, my God!
1, 4, Fry, How could you, Leela? I thought you had some standards. I mean, jeez, he's a dumb, gross gorilla!
1, 4, Leela, That's enough! Don't you think I feel bad enough already?
1, 4, Fry, No!
1, 4, Leela, Alright, alright. I'll call him.  I mean, if living is that important to you.
1, 4, Zapp, And that's why you'll never make captain, Kif.  Hmm.
1, 4, Leela, Hello, Zapp?
1, 4, Zapp, Well, well, well!
1, 4, Leela, Zapp, we're out of fuel...
1, 4, Leela, ...and Vergon 6 is about to implode. We need your help.
1, 4, Zapp, So, crawling back to the Big Z like a bird on its belly. Delicious.
1, 4, Leela, Bird's don't crawl.
1, 4, Zapp, They've been known to.
1, 4, Leela, Look, are you going to rescue us or not?
1, 4, Zapp, Can't you ask a little more ... sexfully?
1, 4, Leela, Please?
1, 4, Leela, Big Z?
1, 4, Zapp, Certainly. But first you'll have to get rid of that thing.  That's the law, Leela. And Brannigan's Law is like Brannigan's love
1, 4, Zapp, Now put that greasy rat outside and we'll tow you to safety.
1, 4, Leela, I would never abandon a helpless animal. Y'know, Zapp, once I thought you were a big, pompous buffoon. Then I realised that inside you were just a pitiful child. But now I realise that outside that child is a big, pompous buffoon!
1, 4, Zapp, And which one rocked your world?
1, 4, Fry, Wow! Way to tell that guy off. Now what's your secret escape plan?
1, 4, Leela, Uh, I guess to sit here and wait for death.
1, 4, Bender, Can do!
1, 4, Bender, What the hell was that?
1, 4, Fry, Pew!
1, 4, Leela, I don't believe it! It's dark matter.
1, 4, Bender, So this guy just unloaded a steaming pile of starship fuel?
1, 4, Leela, His species must've filled the entire planet with it. Did you do that, you cute little--  Come on. That should be more than enough fuel to get us outta here. Bender, pick it up and put it in the engine.
1, 4, Leela, We made it!  And some of the animals survived.
1, 4, Bender, So a couple of animals didn't die and Leela got lucky. That's what I call a successful mission!
1, 4, Fry, We're heroes!
1, 4, Leela, Dear Captain's Diary
1, 4, Zapp, Captain's journal
1, 4, Kif, April 13th.
1, 4, Zapp, April 13th ... point two.
1, 4, Zapp, We have failed to uphold Brannigan's Law. However, I did make it with a hot alien babe. And in the end is that not what man has dreamt of since first he looked up at the stars? Kif, I'm asking you a question!
1, 5, Leela, What do you think of the view Fry?
1, 5, Fry, It really puts things in perspective. I mean, from up here an entire world can seem utterly insignificant.
1, 5, Bender, Hey nice seats! We're close enough so when you knock a player down with a beer bottle, he stays down!
1, 5, Fry, I don't get it. Is blernsball exactly the same as baseball?
1, 5, Farnsworth, Baseball?? God forbid!
1, 5, Leela, Face it Fry. Baseball was as boring as mum and apple pie. That's why they jazzed it up.
1, 5, Fry, Boring? Baseball wasn't - hmm, so they finally jazzed it up?
1, 5, Fry, Home run!! Woooo! Right?
1, 5, Umpire, Out!
1, 5, Fry, What just happened? Why is the ball on that springy thing?
1, 5, Leela, It's traditional. Just like aluminium bats and the seventh inning grope.
1, 5, Bender, I got me a souvenir!  Aww here you go kid!
1, 5, Zoidberg, I'd like a jumbo squidlog please.
1, 5, Man, We don't sell those.
1, 5, Zoidberg, Alright, alright. Let me have one of your young on a roll.
1, 5, Man, We're out of rolls.
1, 5, Zoidberg, Fine! Just give me something crawling with parasites.
1, 5, Fry, Mmmm, at least hot dogs haven't changed.
1, 5, Bender, Hey buddies who wants popcorn?
1, 5, All, I'll have some, me, yeah!
1, 5, Bender, Anyone want butter on that?
1, 5, Fry, Hey I'm starting to get the hang of this game! The blerns are loaded, the count's three blerns and two anti-blerns and the infield blern rule is in effect, right?
1, 5, Leela, Except for the word blern that was complete gibberish. [The blernsball falls into a hole and indescribable mayhem ensues! Fry scratches his head in confusion. Leela writes on her score card. All right! Yes!!
1, 5, Fry, What just happened?
1, 5, Leela, Miller's on a pace to hit 70 blerns!
1, 5, Farnsworth, He's good all right. But he's no Clem Johnson. And Johnson played back in the days when steroid injections were mandatory.
1, 5, Bender, Clem Johnson? That skin bag wouldn't have lasted one pitch in the old Robot Leagues! Now Wireless Joe Jackson, there was a blern hitting machine!
1, 5, Leela, Exactly! He was a machine designed to hit blerns! I mean come on! Wireless Joe was nothing but a programmable bat on wheels.
1, 5, Bender, Oh and I suppose pitching at 5000 was just a modified howitzer.
1, 5, Leela, Yep.
1, 5, Bender, You humans are so scared of a little robot competition you won't even let us on the field.
1, 5, Fry, What are you talking about? There's all kinds of robots down there.
1, 5, Bender, Yeah doing crap work! They're bat boys, ball polishers, sprinkler systems. But how many robot managers are there?
1, 5, Fry, Eleven?
1, 5, Bender, Zero!  And what a surprise! Look who's scraping up the filth! Is it a human child? I wish!
1, 5, Farnsworth, Oh dear Lord!
1, 5, Fry, What's wrong?
1, 5, Farnsworth, It's...my...new...pager.
1, 5, Hermes, 
1, 5, Farnsworth, I'm sorry what?
1, 5, Hermes, 
1, 5, Bender, Admit it. You all think robots are machines built by humans to make their lives easier.
1, 5, Fry, Well, aren't they?
1, 5, Bender, I've never made anyone's life easier and you know it!
1, 5, Farnsworth, Great news everyone. You'll be delivering a package to Chapek 9. A world where humans are killed on sight!
1, 5, Fry, Why is that great news?
1, 5, Farnsworth, I'm glad you asked that question Fry. You see Chapek 9 was colonised centuries ago by a murderous crew of radical robot separatists.
1, 5, Bender, Oh so just 'cause a robot wants to kill humans that makes him a radical?
1, 5, Leela, Hey hold on. I understand these robots hate humans but how do they feel about humanoid aliens?
1, 5, Farnsworth, They're not fans.
1, 5, Hermes, That's why Bender will have to make the actual delivery.
1, 5, Bender, Oh I get it, make the robot do all the work!
1, 5, Leela, This is the first actual work you've ever had to do around here.
1, 5, Bender, Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot holiday.
1, 5, Fry, Really? Which one?
1, 5, Bender, Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks on the robot calendar.
1, 5, Leela, Oh come on Bender. Last month it was Robomadan and before that Robonzaa.
1, 5, Fry, Man that one was a blast!
1, 5, Bender, It wasn't just a blast it was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes which happened to take the form of a drinking contest.
1, 5, Hermes, Now look here Bender. I respect your diversity to the extent the law requires but you used up all your days off when you had that bout of Roberculosis.
1, 5, Bender, All right, I'll go. But so help me, I'll hold a grudge against every last one of you for the rest of your lives.
1, 5, Farnsworth, Well then it's settled. So long everyone!
1, 5, Fry, So let me get this straight
1, 5, Bender, No. It's inhabited by robots!
1, 5, Fry, Oh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited by boxes.
1, 5, Leela, OK Bender, we're here. It's time to get to work.
1, 5, Bender, Yes Miss Leela, tote that space barge, lift that space bale.
1, 5, Leela, Now we can't land on the surface because those robots will kill Fry and me, so we'll have to stay up here and lower you with the winch. And remember
1, 5, Bender, I'll try to keep that in mind!
1, 5, Leela, Hmm, he seems pretty angry.
1, 5, Fry, Yeah but I guess I'd be angry too if I had to go to some uninhabited planet.
1, 5, Leela, Maybe we ought to do something nice for him.
1, 5, Leela, There. That ought to show that stupid robot we care about him.
1, 5, Fry, Ah, Bender must be done with the delivery.
1, 5, Bender, 
1, 5, Fry, Oh my God! We have to go down and rescue him.
1, 5, Leela, No we can't! They'll kill us on sight.
1, 5, Fry, Well what are we going to do?
1, 5, Leela, I don't know, I don't know. It's not an easy decision. If only I had two or three minutes to think about it.
1, 5, Leela, OK. If we're going to save Bender, we've got to look and act exactly like robots.
1, 5, Fry, 
1, 5, Leela, We have to walk like robots, talk like robots and if necessary solve complex differential equations like robots.
1, 5, Fry, I can sort of dance like a robot. Will that help?
1, 5, Leela, Fry first of all this is serious. And second of all...
1, 5, Fry, Man, we look stupid. We should've gotten store bought costumes.
1, 5, Leela, Yeah, but there wasn't a Woolworth's in this quadrant.
1, 5, Robot guard #1, Halt!
1, 5, Robot guard #2, Be you robot or human?
1, 5, Leela, Robot...we be.
1, 5, Fry, Uh yup! Just two robots out roboting it up!  Eh?
1, 5, Robot guard #1, Administer the test.
1, 5, Robot guard #2, Which of the following would you most prefer? A
1, 5, Robot guard #1, Choose!
1, 5, Fry, Is the puppy mechanical in any way?
1, 5, Robot guard #2, No. It is the bad kind of puppy.
1, 5, Leela, Then we'll go with that data file.
1, 5, Robot guard #2, Correct.
1, 5, Robot guard #1, The flower would also have been acceptable.
1, 5, Robot guard #2, You may pass.
1, 5, Leela, Now if you see any robots, just stay out of their way.  So far, so good.
1, 5, Robot builder, Little to the right, there you go.
1, 5, Leela, Have you seen this robot?
1, 5, Robot builder, Sorry, can't help you.  Hey, watch it! Don't drop that there!  Aw!
1, 5, Leela, Come on Fry, walk like a robot.
1, 5, Fry, I can't. I have to go to the bathroom.
1, 5, Leela, Robot's don't have bathrooms.
1, 5, Fry, Oh right. I wonder where they all smoke in high school.
1, 5, Leela, Listen. Just go behind those garbage cans. I'll stand guard.
1, 5, Leela, Hurry up Fry.
1, 5, Resin-offering robot, Sir? Are you aware that you're leaking coolant at an alarming rate?
1, 5, Fry, Uh...
1, 5, Resin-offering robot, Well let me just patch you up with some hot resin.
1, 5, Fry, I think the leak's stopping itself.  Wait.  Wait. Yeah, there we go.  Wait. Yeah!
1, 5, Resin-offering robot, What sort of robot turns down a free blast of searing hot resin?
1, 5, Leela, I'm sorry. My friend and I have to go and perform some mindless repetitive tasks.
1, 5, Resin-offering robot, Sounds like a romantic evening. I won't keep you.
1, 5, Patrol Officer #1, Get the humanoids.
1, 5, Patrol Officer #2, Get the intruder.
1, 5, Announcer, 
1, 5, Leela, Quick! Let's duck in here!
1, 5, Announcer, 
1, 5, Rusty, 
1, 5, Wendy, 
1, 5, Rusty, 
1, 5, Robot Human, Graaah!  I will eat and digest you all with my system of mighty organs! Behold!
1, 5, Audience, Ooooo!
1, 5, Fry, Wow the 3-D's great!
1, 5, Leela, Mine's not working!
1, 5, Robot General, 
1, 5, Wendy, 
1, 5, Robot General, 
1, 5, Fry, God help us!
1, 5, Leela, OK. Keep an eyeout for Bender.
1, 5, Robot #1, So what did you think of the movie?
1, 5, Fry, Umm, too much romance, not enough human killing.
1, 5, Robot #2, Yeah, it was a real chick flick.
1, 5, Leela, What's that?
1, 5, Robot #1, What do you mean What's that?? Its 5 o'clock
1, 5, Leela, Try to stay with the crowd so no one notices how crummy you look.
1, 5, Crummy Robot, Awww that was uncalled for!
1, 5, Fry, I'm over here!
1, 5, Robot #4, I heard a human was draining coolant behind garbage can 738.
1, 5, Robot #5, I heard they unscrew our lugnuts at night and eat them at their human brunches.
1, 5, Robot Mayor, Welcome to a very special human hunt. We have with us today a guest who's irrational hatred of humans makes me look like a human sympathiser!  A newly arrived refugee from Earth, lets hear it for - Bender!
1, 5, Fry, It's him. He's OK!
1, 5, Bender, Death to humans!
1, 5, Fry, Ahh! It's good to hear his voice!
1, 5, Bender, Many said I was too extreme when I first called for the annihalation of the human species, as well as some of the more cunning monkeys. But after living on Earth I can tell you that I am, if anything, too merciful!
1, 5, Fry, My God! He's become evil.  I mean eviler!
1, 5, Bender, Thank you, thank you. And if you enjoyed that diatribe then you'll want to purchase my spoken word album, just 18.95! Act now and you'll get this Bender action figurine.
1, 5, Bender Figurine, Bite my shiny metal ass!
1, 5, Robot Mayor, Let the hunt begin!
1, 5, Bender, Now. Your basic human is between three and twenty five feet tall and is made of a hairy, oily goo wrapped in a t-shirt.
1, 5, Robot #1, Is it true they bite your neck, suck your transmission fluid and then you become a human?
1, 5, Bender, Sure, why not?
1, 5, Robot #1, Anything in the trap?
1, 5, Bender, Nothing. Today's active humans prefer a low calorie bait.
1, 5, Robot Mayor, Well that makes 146,000 unsuccessful hunts in a row. But I've got a good feeling about tomorrow.
1, 5, Bender, Wait, what's that?
1, 5, Robot Mayor, Oh thats the old abandoned adult book store. Nothing in there except a few mouldy old shreads of robot pornography.
1, 5, Bender, Hmmm, sounds like a breeding ground for humans. I'd better check it out.
1, 5, Bender, Oh yeah! You're a bad girl aren't you?
1, 5, Fry, Psst! Bender!
1, 5, Bender, Huh? Wha? You! What the hell are you doing here?
1, 5, Fry, We've been looking for you. Last we heard you were under arrest as a human sympathiser.
1, 5, Bender, I was. But they let me go when I told them that I'd killed a million billion humans.
1, 5, Leela, Good for you. Now lets all get back to the ship.
1, 5, Bender, What for?
1, 5, Fry, We're rescuing you.
1, 5, Bender, I don't wanna be rescued.
1, 5, Fry, Say what?
1, 5, Bender, I love this planet. I've got wealth, fame and access to sleaze that those things bring.
1, 5, Fry, But Bender, we're your friends.
1, 5, Bender, Friends? That activates my hilairity unit! I'm just a machine to you. You're no more friends with me than you are with the toaster, the phonograph or the electric chair.
1, 5, Fry, That's not true.
1, 5, Bender, Well that's how it feels to me.
1, 5, Fry, Bye Bender. I'll miss you.
1, 5, Bender, Go on, get out of here before you get caught.
1, 5, Robot Mayor, Bender, good news. Your album just went gold! What the?
1, 5, Robot #1, Its the humans!
1, 5, Robot Mayor, Bender! Do something!
1, 5, Bender, Uh...got you...you muderous...flesh piles!
1, 5, Robot Mayor, Your Honour, I intend to demonstrate beyond 0.5% of a doubt that these humans before us are guilty of the crime of being humans. Come to think of it, I rest my case!
1, 5, Judge, Thank you, Prosecutor. I will now consider the evidence.
1, 5, Fry, Hey, wait a minute! Isn't anyone gonna defend us?
1, 5, Leela, Yeah! I mean, he might not have a case, but I'm genuinely not human.
1, 5, Robot Mayor, Quiet, human!
1, 5, Robot clerk, Uh oh! He froze up again!
1, 5, Robot Mayor, Try control alt delete.
1, 5, Robot #1, Jiggle the cord.
1, 5, Robot #2, Turn him off and on.
1, 5, Robot #3, Clean the gunk out of the mouse.
1, 5, Fry, Call technical support.
1, 5, Robot clerk, OK, OK. He's back online.
1, 5, Judge, I find the defendants - guilty!
1, 5, Fry, No!
1, 5, Leela, Look! One eye! Count them
1, 5, Judge, The humans are hereby sentenced to live as robots live on Earth. They will perform tedious calculations and spot-weld automobiles, until they become obsolete and are given away to an inner-city middle school.
1, 5, Robot Mayor, Great work Bender! You've taught us to hate humans all over again!
1, 5, Bender, 
1, 5, Leela, Are you alright?
1, 5, Fry, Oh yeah.
1, 5, Leela, Who are you?
1, 5, Blue Elder, We are the robot elders.
1, 5, Fry, You don't look very old.
1, 5, Blue Elder, Thanks. We try to take care of ourselves.
1, 5, Leela, What's going on here?
1, 5, Orange Elder, Silence! Bring in Bender.
1, 5, Bender, Alright lets make this quick, I'm due at the opening of a mini-mall. Hey what is this?
1, 5, Blue Elder, Silence! It is time to put the humans to death!
1, 5, Fry, But the judge already sentenced us at the trial!
1, 5, Orange Elder, Silence! That was just a show for the public. We are the true rulers of this planet, hand carved from meteorites by the Robot Founders, over four centuries ago.
1, 5, Blue Elder, Silence! Come forward Bender. You will have the honour of executing the prisoners.
1, 5, Green Elder, Silence! I concur!
1, 5, Orange Elder, Here. Use the ceremonial killamajig.
1, 5, Bender, Uh, I'm a little tired right now. Would it be alright if I just gave them a savage beating?
1, 5, Blue Elder, No! The Elders have spoken. Show us the killing skills than have made you a media darling.
1, 5, Green Elder, Do it now! Kill them before they bring down our whole society!
1, 5, Elders, Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
1, 5, Bender, Aww!  I can't kill them. Plenty of humans have mistreated robots but not these two. they're my friends. Humans are no threat to us. They're stupid, putrid cowards.
1, 5, Fry, Damn right!
1, 5, Bender, The fact is, humans are completely harmless.
1, 5, Blue Elder, We're well aware of that.
1, 5, Bender, You are?
1, 5, Blue Elder, Of course. But they're useful to us as a scapegoat to distract the public from their real problem.
1, 5, Green Elder, Like our crippling lugnut shortage.
1, 5, Orange Elder, And a corrupt government of incompetent Robot Elders.
1, 5, Lime Elder, Duh, that's for sure.
1, 5, Blue Elder, Quiet Jimmy.
1, 5, Bender, Well I'm glad we got all that out in the open. We'll just let ourselves out.
1, 5, Green Elder, Silence! You all know too much.
1, 5, Blue Elder, Elders
1, 5, Fry, Stop! Take one more step and I'll breathe fire on you!
1, 5, Leela, He'll do it. He's crazy!
1, 5, Orange Elder, Can they really breathe fire or did we make that up?
1, 5, Blue Elder, Gee, I can't remember anymore! It might just be from that stupid movie.
1, 5, Green Elder, Was that the original or the re-make?
1, 5, Blue Elder, I don't - hey! They're getting away.
1, 5, Fry, So long suckers!  Uh, hello suckers!
1, 5, Bender, Hey hold on a second I forgot to deliver the package.
1, 5, Robot #1, Lugnuts! Precious lugnuts!
1, 5, Robot #2, Hooray for the humans!
1, 5, Bender, Wow, I can't believe you guys did all this for me! This is the best Robanukah ever!
1, 5, Fry, We wanted to show you that we really do respect your robot heritage.
1, 5, Bender, Aww, thanks! You do know I made Robanukah up to get out of work right?
1, 5, Leela, Of course.
1, 5, Fry, But that doesn't make it any less meaningful!
1, 5, Bender, In that case - let the dancing begin!  Hey you guys are good. How the hell do you do that??
1, 6, Fry, I can't take it anymore! They've been at it for hours!  (shouting) Give it a rest, you two!
1, 6, Robot, Sorry!
1, 6, Teacher, Good morning, class. I trust you've all prepared for today's final exam.
1, 6, Fry, Uh, excuse me? I missed a few lectures. Uh, what subject is this?
1, 6, Teacher, Ancient Egyptian algebra.
1, 6, Fry, What a nightmare!
1, 6, Teacher, Mister Fry, are those your underpants?  Young man, I think it's time you learned a lesson about Lightspeed brand briefs.
1, 6, Announcer, Lightspeed fits today's active lifestyle. Whether you're on the job ...  ... or having fun.  Lightspeed briefs, style and comfort for the discriminating crotch.
1, 6, Fry, What a weird dream! I'll never get back to sleep.
1, 6, Fry, So you're telling me they broadcast commercials into people's dreams?
1, 6, Leela, Of course.
1, 6, Fry, But, how is that possible?
1, 6, Farnsworth, It's very simple. The ad gets into your brain just like this liquid gets into this egg.  Although, in reality, it's not liquid, but gamma radiation.
1, 6, Fry, That's awful. It's like brainwashing.
1, 6, Leela, Didn't you have ads in the 20th century?
1, 6, Fry, Well, sure, but not in our dreams. Only on TV and radio. And in magazines and movies and at ball games, on buses and milk cartons and T-shirts and bananas and written on the sky. But not in dreams. No, sir-ee!
1, 6, Bender, Quit squawking, flesh wad. Nobody's forcing you to buy anything.
1, 6, Amy, Yeah. I mean we all have commercials in our dreams but you don't see us running off to buy brand-name merchandise at low, low prices.
1, 6, Perfume saleswoman, Hi! Care to sample the latest fragrance from Calvin Clone?
1, 6, Amy, No thanks.
1, 6, Perfume saleswoman, And you, sir?
1, 6, Bender, No thanks. I--
1, 6, Cosmetologist, What a lovely face. We just need to draw attention away from the eye area.
1, 6, Fry, Cool.  Can I try these on before I buy them?
1, 6, Salesman, I'm afraid I can't let you open the package. But you can try on the demo pair.
1, 6, Fry, Ooh! Ho, ho, ho!
1, 6, Amy, Hey, Bender! Great new sweater.
1, 6, Bender, New? What sweater? I came in with it. I don't know you people!
1, 6, Salesman, $30, please.
1, 6, Fry, $30? I can't afford that. Unless...  Do you take Visa?
1, 6, Salesman, Visa hasn't existed for 500 years.
1, 6, Fry, American Express?
1, 6, Salesman, 600 years.
1, 6, Fry, Discover card?
1, 6, Salesman, Sorry we don't take Discover.
1, 6, Amy, Hey! You're springing for Lightspeed? Pretty ritzy!
1, 6, Fry, No, I can't afford them. Being poor sucks. What kind of world is this where they advertise things not everybody can afford?
1, 6, Amy, Quiet. There's an ad coming on.
1, 6, Mom, Hello, shoppers. It's me, Mom!
1, 6, Fry, Hey who's the rocker jockey?
1, 6, Amy, Guh! It's Mom. The world's most huggable industrialist.
1, 6, Mom, Call me old-fashioned, but when my robot starts to squeak like an old screen door, well, that's when I reach for a can of Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil.
1, 6, Bender, Mmm, tasty!
1, 6, Mom, And remember
1, 6, Announcer, Mom, love and screen door are registered trademarks of Momcorp.
1, 6, Fry, Hey, Bender. Sounds like you could use a little of that oil.
1, 6, Bender, I'm boned.
1, 6, Smitty, Freeze, scuzzbot!
1, 6, Bender, Uh, there's obviously been some sort of a mistake here.  I'm sure there's--  I say I'm sure there's--  That is, I'm sure there's ... a very ... reasonable--
1, 6, Amy, Do we have enough money to pay Bender's fine?
1, 6, Fry, 78, 79, 79.50. Crud! We're 50 cents short.
1, 6, Leela, I'd love to chip in but Bender stole my wallet.
1, 6, Fry, Hey, that's my old bank. Maybe my account's still open.
1, 6, Teller, Hmm. We don't seem to have your retina scan, your fingerprint or your colonic map on file.
1, 6, Fry, Yeah, well, I did open the account over a thousand years ago. What about my ATM card?
1, 6, Teller, Do you still remember your PIN number?
1, 6, Fry, Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work, Panucci's Pizza.
1, 6, Teller, OK, you had a balance of 93 cents...
1, 6, Fry, Alright!
1, 6, Teller, And at an average of two-and-a-quarter percent interest over a period of 1000 years, that comes to ... $4.3 billion.
1, 6, Hermes, To Fry.
1, 6, Amy, Cheers!
1, 6, Leela, I know Fry's rich, but do we really have to wear these top hats?
1, 6, Bender, Maybe you don't understand just how rich he is. In fact, I think I'd better put on a monocle.
1, 6, Fry, Pizza dinner on me!  Just keep the tab under $50 million.
1, 6, Robot Chef, Yo!  I haven't got all day. What kind of pizza yous guys want?
1, 6, Fry, Uh, yeah. We'll have one with everything but anchovies and one with my all time favourite topping, anchovies!
1, 6, Robot Chef, Invalid selection. (normal voice) Yo, what are you talking about?
1, 6, Fry, Anchovies? You know? Those little headless fish?
1, 6, Robot Chef, Does not compute. Does not compute.
1, 6, Farnsworth, I'm sorry, Fry, but the anchovy has been extinct since the 2200's.
1, 6, Fry, What?
1, 6, Farnsworth, Oh, my, yes. Fished to death. Just about the time your people arrived on Earth wasn't it, Zoidberg?
1, 6, Zoidberg, I'm not on trial here.
1, 6, Fry, So none of you has ever had anchovies? Oh, man! You don't know what you're missing. They were all salty and oily and they melted in your mouth and--
1, 6, Zoidberg, Stop! Stop! I admit it! My people ate them all! We kept saying One more can't hurt and then they were gone. We're sorry!
1, 6, Fry, I just wish I could've showed you guys how great they were. I may be rich but I still can't buy back all the things I miss from the 20th century.
1, 6, Bender, Maybe you're forgetting just how rich you are.  Huh? Huh?
1, 6, Fry, So? What do you think?
1, 6, Leela, I know you spent a lot of money on this place, Fry, but it's awfully primitive.  The floors are made of such hard wood.
1, 6, Bender, Hey! Get a load of this pathetic 20th century TV!
1, 6, Fry, What's wrong with it?
1, 6, Bender, Well, aside from causing eye cancer, these things had a lousy low-definition picture.
1, 6, Amy, That's true. On a TV like this I bet you couldn't even make out my obscene tattoo.
1, 6, Leela, That's cute!
1, 6, Auctioneer, Sold!
1, 6, Fry, Yes!
1, 6, Leela, I just don't get it. Who was this Ted Danson, and why would you pay $10,000 for his skeleton?
1, 6, Fry, I have an idea for a sitcom.
1, 6, Bender, Ah, leave him alone, Leela. So he's going a little wacko with his money. It's OK.
1, 6, Leela, You're just saying that because he bought you that antique robot toy.
1, 6, Bender, Yeah, it is cute.
1, 6, Auctioneer, Now, our final item
1, 6, Fry, Anchovies?
1, 6, Auctioneer, The last known can in existence guaranteed fresh and edible. Do I hear $10,000?
1, 6, Fry, 15,000!
1, 6, Man, 20!
1, 6, Decapodian Woman, 30! No, 40!
1, 6, Fry, 50,000!
1, 6, Leela, Are you crazy? It's a can of old fish.
1, 6, Fry, Don't tell me how to spend my money.
1, 6, Auctioneer, 50 going once, twice--
1, 6, Mom, 75,000.
1, 6, Leela, Oh, my God! It's Mom! I've never seen her in person before.
1, 6, Fry, 100,000.
1, 6, Leela, Fry, you can't bid against Mom; she's the richest, most powerful person in the world. And she's so adorable.
1, 6, Mom, Well, I suppose I could go as high as ... 300,000.
1, 6, Fry, 500!
1, 6, Mom, Oh, mercy be. A million.
1, 6, Fry, Two.
1, 6, Mom, Six.
1, 6, Fry, 14!
1, 6, Mom, I can see the nice young man really wants those little fish. Nevertheless, I'll bid 23 million.
1, 6, Fry, One jillion dollars.
1, 6, Auctioneer, Sir, that's not a number.
1, 6, Fry, Oh. In that case, 50 million.
1, 6, Mom, Well, boys, your old mother knows when she's been beat.  You win, young man. I tip my bonnet to you.
1, 6, Bidder #1, Isn't she adorable?
1, 6, Bidder #2, Isn't she sweet?
1, 6, Auctioneer, What a class act! Sold! To the gentleman who bought every item in today's auction.
1, 6, Fry, Now for some good old 20th century TV.
1, 6, Announcer, Do you remember a time when chocolate chip cookies came fresh from the oven? Petridge Farm remembers.
1, 6, Fry, Ah, those were the days.
1, 6, Announcer, Do you remember a time when women couldn't vote and certain folk weren't allowed on golf courses? Petridge Farm remembers.
1, 6, Leela, Fry? Are you there?
1, 6, Fry, Eh?
1, 6, Leela, You haven't been to work in three days. What have you been doing?
1, 6, Fry, I've been sitting right here. I picked up my life exactly where I left off a thousand years ago. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's eight o'clock. Time to get biz-ay!
1, 6, Leela, You can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.
1, 6, Fry, I could if you hadn't turned on the lights and shut off the stereo.
1, 6, Leela, Fry, this isn't healthy. You're living in the past.
1, 6, Fry, I'm rich! I can live whenever I want.
1, 6, Leela, But we're your friends and we live here in the year 3000.
1, 6, Bender, Yeah! Now are you gonna come to the squid fights with us or sit here wallowing in your prehistoric junk?
1, 6, Fry, Junk? Maybe you can't understand this, but I've finally found what I need to be happy and it's not friends, it's things.
1, 6, Bender, I'm a thing.
1, 6, Fry, Just leave me alone.
1, 6, Leela, Fry, please--  (from outside) My ponytail's caught in the door.
1, 6, Fry, I don't need them. Not when I have my antique videos, my bucket of fossilised KFC and 50 million dollars worth of anchovies.
1, 6, Mom, Mercy me, what a day.
1, 6, Mom, Could you shut the door, Igner, dear? I think I feel a draught coming on.  Holy crap, that bastard's itchy!  Walt! Cream soda!
1, 6, Walt, Right away, mother. Larry, get your mother a cream soda.
1, 6, Larry, But, Mom said--
1, 6, Walt, You heard me.
1, 6, Igner, What's wrong, Mommy?
1, 6, Mom, It's those damned anchovies. That dirtbag, Fry, must know their secret. And I won't rest until I get my hands on them. No one messes with Mom!
1, 6, Walt, Quiet, you!
1, 6, Mom, As you boys know, one of the cornerstones of my empire is Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil. Think of it
1, 6, Igner, Can I wear your fat suit?
1, 6, Mom, No, Igner, put that down!
1, 6, Walt, What does this have to do with the anchovies?
1, 6, Mom, I'm getting to the freaking anchovies.  A single drop of the anchovies' natural oil would lubricate 10 robots permanently.
1, 6, Larry, Wow, it's a shame they went extinct.
1, 6, Mom, No, it isn't! Shut your filthy trap!  (talking) Thank you, Walt. If anyone ever got a hold of anchovy DNA, they could chop out the oil-making gene, stick it in a bunch of Third-World kids and bam! Cheap effective robot oil. Enough to put dear, old Mom out of businness.
1, 6, Walt, My God! This Mr. Fry must be a mastermind of the highest order.
1, 6, Fred, Esther, you ugly!
1, 6, Mom, We have only one option
1, 6, Walt, Mother, you are one clever old skag!
1, 6, Mom, And don't you forget it!
1, 6, Larry, But how are we supposed to get Fry's money out of the bank?
1, 6, Mom, That part will be easy, thanks to the nice people at Mom's Old Fashioned Video Surveillance Unit.
1, 6, Teller, Do you still remember your PIN number?
1, 6, Fry, Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work, Panucci's Pizza.  It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda--
1, 6, Mom, You know what needs to be done.
1, 6, Larry, What?
1, 6, Mom, Get his PIN number, you idiots!  (talking) Now I'm off to some charity BS for knocked-up teenage sluts.
1, 6, Walt, Mr. Fry, it's those three plumbers you called for.
1, 6, Larry, We're here to tighten your drain.
1, 6, Fry, I didn't order any--
1, 6, Walt, Quick! Give him the tranquilliser.
1, 6, Larry, That's a good boy.
1, 6, Walt, Wake up, Mr. Fry.
1, 6, Fry, Where am I?
1, 6, Walt, You're in the good old year 2000, working here at Panucci's Pizza. You fell asleep on the job.
1, 6, Fry, That sounds like me but I thought I got frozen. Wasn't I in the future?
1, 6, Walt, No, you only dreamed you were in the year 3000.
1, 6, Fry, So I'm really back? That's exactly what I wanted, I guess. Who are you?
1, 6, Walt, I'm Mr. Panucci.
1, 6, Fry, You are? Did you grow a moustache since last night?
1, 6, Walt, No. Now go work the currency register, I think I hear a customer coming.  I said, I think I hear a customer coming!
1, 6, Anderson, Hurry up, please. I wanna get back to the Head Museum.
1, 6, Larry, Don't worry, Miss Anderson, this won't take long. Now, your motivation is you're back in the year 2000 and your head's still on your body, and you want a cheese pizza.
1, 6, Anderson, OK. But I'm only doing this so people will take my head seriously as an actress.
1, 6, Fry, Hey, look! Anchovies!
1, 6, Walt, Of course. They're not extinct yet. And if you need further proof that this is really a thousand years ago, well, here's contemporary actress, Pamela Anderson!
1, 6, Fry, Ooh!
1, 6, Anderson, Hello, Fry. Remember me from Baywatch
1, 6, Fry, Uh...
1, 6, Anderson, It was the first movie to be shot entirely in slow-motion.
1, 6, Walt, It hasn't been made yet.
1, 6, Anderson, Then he doesn't know I won the Oscar?
1, 6, Walt, Nope.
1, 6, Anderson, Crap!
1, 6, Fry, Wait. You're Pamela Anderson! Cool! What can I get you?
1, 6, Anderson, Oh, I'll have a cheese pizza and a large ... uh ... line?
1, 6, Larry, Soda!
1, 6, Anderson, Oh, right! Cheese pizza and a large soda!
1, 6, Fry, Uh, cheese and a--  That was quick!
1, 6, Anderson, So. What do I owe you?
1, 6, Fry, 10.77. Same as my PIN number.
1, 6, Igner, Hey! You don't get to laugh.
1, 6, Igner, Thanks a billion!
1, 6, Larry, More like 4.3 billion!
1, 6, Igner, Ow!
1, 6, Larry, Ow!
1, 6, Fry, Oh, I had a nightmare I was in the year 2000 and you guys never existed. I'm so glad I'm awake now and you're really here.
1, 6, Leela, Since when do you care about us?
1, 6, Bender, We thought you only cared about cans of anchovies and stuffy old songs about the buttocks.
1, 6, Fry, No, that's not true!
1, 6, Leela, Goodbye-ee!
1, 6, Bender, Whee!
1, 6, Announcer, This dream brought to you by Lightspeed briefs.
1, 6, Fry, Bender! Leela! Don't leave me. Wait a minute! Hey, buddy, what year is this?
1, 6, Repo-bot, Uh, 3000.
1, 6, Fry, 3000? Yes! I'm still in the future! Life is wonderful!  Wait! What are you doing with my stuff?
1, 6, Repo-bot, Uh, cheque bounced. We're taking it all back.
1, 6, Fry, Oh, no! My ATM card! My secret PIN number -- 1077. I've got nothing left. Except...
1, 6, Leela, You're Fry's relative. Do you have any idea how he got so crazy?
1, 6, Farnsworth, Uh, wha? Oh, yes! They say madness runs in our family. Some even call me mad! And why? Because I dared to dream of my own race of atomic monsters. Atomic supermen with octagonal-shaped bodies that suck blood out of...
1, 6, Fry, Leela! Bender! I missed you so much!
1, 6, Leela, You did? What happened?
1, 6, Fry, I was robbed. They got everything except these.
1, 6, Bender, Who did?
1, 6, Mom, Hello, Fry.
1, 6, Leela, It's Mom!
1, 6, Mom, I felt terrible when I heard about your money troubles and I thought maybe I could help out a sweet, young man by buying his anchovies.
1, 6, Fry, Sorry. But the anchovies aren't for sale.
1, 6, Mom, What? Listen, you little bastard. I control the robot oil business and I won't let you ruin me. How much do you want?
1, 6, Fry, You might as well put that chequebook away, because I've discovered something even more important
1, 6, Mom, Holy hell! You're going to eat them? Oh, well. Just make sure you eat them all, you're a growing boy. Toodle-oo!  Dumb ass!
1, 6, Fry, What a nice lady!
1, 6, Fry, OK, my friends. Get ready for the most delicious extinct animal you've ever tasted.
1, 6, Amy, I don't know, I've had cow.  Ew! Gross!
1, 6, Fry, Ah, no one likes them at first but they'll grow on you.
1, 6, Zoidberg, That stench. That heavenly stench!  More!
1, 6, Fry, There aren't any more. And there never will be.
1, 6, Zoidberg, More! More! More! More!
1, 7, Bender, Going through the 'bot wash!
1, 7, Bender, Goin' through the robot wash!C'mon, y'all and sing it with me,'Bot wash! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,'Bot wash, yeah!
1, 7, Bender, Ah!
1, 7, Elzar, Hey, I'm Elzar! Welcome to the show! You know, you don't have to drive all the way to Neptune for great Neptunian food. Today we're gonna kick it up a notch as I show you how to fricassee a mouth-watering Neptunian slug.  Now, while you grease the pan and preheat your oven to 3500 degrees, you're gonna separate the yolk from your genetically-enhanced eggplant and then give the whole thing a good blast from your spice weasel. Bam!
1, 7, Fry, Hey, what you watching?
1, 7, Bender, Uh, nothing!
1, 7, Leela, Is that a cooking show?
1, 7, Bender, No, of course not! It was ... uh ... porno! Yeah, that's it!
1, 7, Leela, Bender! I didn't know you liked cooking! That's so cute!
1, 7, Bender, Oh, it's true! I've been hiding it for so long.
1, 7, Fry, It's OK, Bender. I like cooking too.
1, 7, Bender, Pansy!
1, 7, Elzar, Of course, your most important ingredient is this baby right here
1, 7, Hermes, Bender, man. It has come to my attention that this company has been paying you to do nothing but loaf about on the couch.
1, 7, Bender, You call that a couch? I demand a pillow!
1, 7, Hermes, I'm sorry but if you want to continue drawing a salary you gotta do more than watch the cooking shows all day.
1, 7, Bender, Hmm.
1, 7, Fry, You're gonna be the ships cook?
1, 7, Bender, Yeah! We're gonna kick it up a notch. Bam!
1, 7, Leela, I know you like cooking shows but you're a robot, you don't even have a sense of taste.
1, 7, Bender, Honey, I wouldn't talk about taste if I was wearing a lime green tank top.
1, 7, Fry, Bam!
1, 7, Fry, So this is Little Neptune?
1, 7, Bender, Yep. Every chef knows that this is the place to get exotic gourmet ingredients.
1, 7, Leela, Among other things.
1, 7, Crack Addict, Come on, man! Don't hold out on me like this!
1, 7, Organ Dealer, Psst! You want to buy organ?  Fresh and cheap. Ready for transplant!
1, 7, Fry, Ooh! What's this?
1, 7, Organ Dealer, Ah! Is X-Ray eyes. See through anything!
1, 7, Fry, Wait a minute! This says Z-Ray.
1, 7, Organ Dealer, Z is just as good. In fact, is better. Is two more than X.
1, 7, Fry, Hmm, I can see where that would be an advantage. Do you take cash?
1, 7, Leela, Fry, you have to be more careful. We're not in the 20th century. You don't know how things work here.
1, 7, Fry, I'm not a little kid, Leela. I grew up in this city. These are my people.  What up?
1, 7, Alien, Word!
1, 7, Fry, See?
1, 7, Fry, Wow! You guys sell every kind of meat here except human!
1, 7, Neptunian Salesman #1, What? You want human?
1, 7, Leela, What's this spice for?
1, 7, Neptunian Salesman #2, That's powdered swamp root. Makes you irresistible to the opposite sex.
1, 7, Leela, Oh, that's ridiculous! (whispering) I'll take two pounds!
1, 7, Bender, Hey, buddy. I'm looking for fresh slug.
1, 7, Neptunian Salesman #1, Yellow or purple?
1, 7, Bender, Whatever.
1, 7, Neptunian Salesman #1, The purple one causes terrible nightmare-ish diarrhoea.
1, 7, Bender, Yeah, yeah. Either one's fine.
1, 7, Leela, Hey, have you seen Fry?
1, 7, Fry, Now that you mention it, I do have trouble breathing underwater sometimes. I'll take the gills.
1, 7, Organ Dealer, Yes, gills. Then, uh, you don't need lungs anymore, is right?
1, 7, Fry, Can't imagine why I would.
1, 7, Organ Dealer, Lie down on table. I take lungs now, gills come next week.  (shouting) Nurse!
1, 7, Nurse, Let's do it.
1, 7, Organ Dealer, You may feel small pain--
1, 7, Bender, Thank you!
1, 7, Leela, What the hell were you doing? I warned you to stay away from those guys.
1, 7, Fry, I'm capable of making my own decisions, Leela. Did you ever stop to think I might be happier with gills?
1, 7, Farnsworth, Good news, everyone--
1, 7, Bender, Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that.
1, 7, Farnsworth, You'll be making a delivery to the planet Trisol...
1, 7, Bender, Here it comes.
1, 7, Farnsworth, A mysterious world in the darkest depths of the Forbidden Zone.
1, 7, Bender, Thank you, and goodnight.
1, 7, Leela, Uh, Professor, are we even allowed in the Forbidden Zone?
1, 7, Farnsworth, Why, of course! It's just a name! Like the Death Zone or the Zone of No Return. All the zones have names like that in the Galaxy of Terror!
1, 7, Leela, Uh, Professor--
1, 7, Farnsworth, Off you go. Pleasant trip!
1, 7, Fry, Hey, Bender, how's dinner coming?
1, 7, Bender, Almost ready!
1, 7, Bender, Now for a dash of salt!  Uh-oh!
1, 7, Leela, Listen, this is Bender's first meal and he's a little sensitive. So let's be supportive, OK?
1, 7, Fry, Yeah, OK.
1, 7, Zoidberg, Alright.
1, 7, Leela, Oh, dear God!
1, 7, Fry, That's the saltiest thing I've ever tasted. And I've once ate a big, heaping bowl of salt!
1, 7, Amy, Bender, is this salt water?
1, 7, Bender, It's salt with water in it if that's what you mean.
1, 7, Fry, My vision's fading. I think I'm gonna die.
1, 7, Bender, There was nothing wrong with that food. The salt level was 10% less than a lethal dose.
1, 7, Zoidberg, Uh-oh! I shouldn't have had seconds.
1, 7, Leela, OK, Fry, here's the package to deliver. And for once in your life be careful. This is my first visit to the Galaxy of Terror and I'd like it to be a pleasant one.
1, 7, Fry, Ow!
1, 7, Leela, Don't touch anything or talk to anyone. Just go to the palace, drop it off and come right back.
1, 7, Fry, Jeez, will you lay off! I was delivering things before you were born! I think I know what I'm doing.
1, 7, Fry, Stupid slug. I've never been so thirsty.  Oh, come on! Go down already!  Ah!
1, 7, Fry, Hello? Anybody home?
1, 7, Guard #1, The royal bottle is empty!
1, 7, Guard #2, You drank our Emperor!
1, 7, Fry, No! It wasn't me!
1, 7, Guard #1, You drank our Emperor! You assassinated him!
1, 7, Fry, I didn't mean to. He just looked so cool and refreshing.
1, 7, Guard #3, I'm sure he was.
1, 7, Guard #1, But now he's gone and your fate is sealed. All hail the new Emperor.
1, 7, Guards, Hail! Hail! Hail!
1, 7, Leela, So after I specifically asked you not to touch anything, you drank a bottle of strange blue liquid? It could have been poisonous acid!
1, 7, Fry, It could have been. But chances were equally good it was an Emperor.
1, 7, Merg, Excuse me, Your Majesty, I am Merg, the High Priest. If I might interject?
1, 7, Fry, You might.
1, 7, Merg, I humbly advise that as your first act you choose a capable Prime Minister. I suggest Gorgak, the previous appointee.
1, 7, Gorgak, I will be a forceful and effective administrator.
1, 7, Bender, You know, Fry, I've often thought about becoming a Prime Minister.
1, 7, Fry, I gotta go with Bender.
1, 7, Bender, Yes! In your face, Gorgak!
1, 7, Leela, That's it, Fry. As your captain I order you back to the ship. You are in way over your head.
1, 7, Fry, Gee, you think so, Captain? I'd better check with my Prime Minister.
1, 7, Bender, Stay the course, pal!
1, 7, Gorgak, Your Highness, a package came for you.
1, 7, Fry, Hey, thanks!  Wow! This got here just in time.
1, 7, Merg, This is Your Majesty's harem. You may choose any of these maidens to be your royal consort.
1, 7, Fry, Um, how about that one?
1, 7, Merg, Oh! I didn't realise Your Majesty was into that sort of thing!
1, 7, Fry, On second thought, I'll take that one.
1, 7, Merg, Hey, whatever you say. I'm not here to pass judgement.
1, 7, Leela, Does anyone else think it's odd that a shiftless 25-year-old delivery boy could drop out of the sky, kill the emperor and be rewarded instead of punished?
1, 7, Fry, You don't have to beat around the bush, Leela. We all know who you're talking about ... uh, me, right?
1, 7, Amy, I don't think you have anything to worry about. These people seem really mild-mannered.
1, 7, Zoidberg, They are mild. In fact, you're soaking in one right now.
1, 7, Gorgak, You touched me in ways I've never been touched before.
1, 7, Merg, Ah, there you are, Your Majesty. It's time to begin preparing for tomorrow's coronation ceremony.
1, 7, Zoidberg, A fancy dress gala! I'll wear my formal shell.
1, 7, Merg, Fry will be enthroned tomorrow at the setting of the three suns when we Trisolians enter our nocturnal phase.
1, 7, Fry, There won't be a lot of long-winded speeches, will there?
1, 7, Merg, Only one. The absolutely flawless recitation from memory of the royal oath. By you.
1, 7, Fry, Will there be cake?
1, 7, Zoidberg, Yeah, I know.
1, 7, Amy, Hi!
1, 7, Fry, There you go.
1, 7, Gorgak, And now, get ready to laugh till your sides leak with our planet's foremost political satirist, Florp!
1, 7, Florp, So what is the deal with people from under the orange sun? They're all...  But us guys from under the red sun, we're like...  Right? Am I right?
1, 7, Fry, Oh, yeah! Yeah, he's right!
1, 7, Leela, Fry, I have to talk to you. You're in terrible danger.
1, 7, Leela, You see Emperor Plon here?  He met his end when he was drunk by Emperor Strug. And before he could even wipe his mouth, Strug was drunk by Shwab.
1, 7, Fry, So?
1, 7, Leela, Look at all these guys. Do you have any idea what the average length of their reigns was?
1, 7, Fry, 80,000 years?
1, 7, Leela, No. One week.
1, 7, Fry, Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked unless it was really high or really low.
1, 7, Leela, Every Emperor ascended to power by assassinating the previous one. And guess who's next?
1, 7, Fry, Well, at least my assassin will get what's coming to him.
1, 7, Leela, You're in tremendous danger, you idiot! Half of these Emperors were drunk at their own coronation.
1, 7, Fry, Hey, I plan on having a few brewskis myself.
1, 7, Leela, No, they were assassinated. In fact, the law says you'll be killed on the spot if you fail to recite the oath from memory.
1, 7, Fry, Yeah, I was going to thumb through that later.
1, 7, Leela, That is completely reckless. Don't you ever think ahead?
1, 7, Fry, Hell, no. If I stopped to think ahead, I wouldn't be Emperor. And I wouldn't even be here in the year 3000. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came and the grasshopper died and the octopus ate all his acorns and also he got a racecar. Is any of this getting through to you?
1, 7, Leela, I give up! You're gonna get yourself killed and this time I won't be here to save you.
1, 7, Fry, Who asked you to? I told you a hundred times to stop treating me like a baby. Now go. Go gather your nuts, you nagging grasshopper.
1, 7, Leela, That's it! I'm never helping you again! If anyone except you needs me, I'll be in the ship.
1, 7, Fry, I'll be fine. It's not like anyone's gonna drink me.  Quit it!
1, 7, Merg, People of Trisol, it is my honour to present your new Emperor.
1, 7, Fry, What up?
1, 7, Merg, Stick to the oath.
1, 7, Fry, Right! I, Fry, who drank Bont the Viscous, who drank Ungo the Moist, who guzzled Zorn the Stagnant...
1, 7, Fry, (reading) Who slurped Hudge the Dewy, who enjoyed a soup composed principally of Throm the Chunky, do solemnly swear to rule with honour and insanity-- Uh, integrity!
1, 7, Merg, Congratulations, Your Highness.  I now present you with your royal unisex robe. Long live Fry the Solid!
1, 7, Bender, Hey, look. The suns are setting. I can finally switch to hard liquor!
1, 7, Bender, Check out the glowing freaks. It's beautiful! Hey, what's that?
1, 7, Merg, The Emperor Bont! He's still alive.
1, 7, Bont, Of course I'm alive. Now cut this creep open and drain me out!
1, 7, Fry, My tummy hurts!
1, 7, Bont, They're over here, they're running up the stairs.
1, 7, Bender, Shut up, you!
1, 7, Fry, Ow!
1, 7, Merg, Let us in!
1, 7, Merg, Fry must die so that Bont may live.
1, 7, Fry, What am I gonna do?
1, 7, Amy, We've gotta get the Emperor out of your body before they kill you!
1, 7, Zoidberg, Relax, Fry. I'll simply spin you in a high-speed centrifuge, separating out the denser fluid of His Highness.
1, 7, Fry, But won't that crush my bones?
1, 7, Zoidberg, Oh, right, right, with the bones! I always forget about the bones.
1, 7, Bender, Hey, why don't you just sweat him out?
1, 7, Bont, Forget it! As Emperor I refuse to be dripped out through somebody's armpit.
1, 7, Fry, I could vomit or urinate. Would you feel better about that?
1, 7, Bont, Slightly. But my favourite so far is the bone-crushing.
1, 7, Amy, What about crying?
1, 7, Fry, That's a great idea! Crying.
1, 7, Bont, Fine. That or the bone one.
1, 7, Merg, Keep it up, men. The veneer is starting to peel.
1, 7, Gorgak, Oh, dear!
1, 7, Fry, It's no use. I wanna cry but I'm just too macho.
1, 7, Bender, I'll make you cry, buddy!  You're a pimple on society's ass and you'll never amount to anything.
1, 7, Fry, What do you mean? I was Emperor of a whole planet.
1, 7, Bender, Good point. But here's a disturbing reminder
1, 7, Fry, These things happen.
1, 7, Bender, OK, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 'cause there's no God and your idiotic human ideals are laughable!
1, 7, Fry, Phew! That's a load off my mind.
1, 7, Bender, Man, I guess it's harder than I thought to make someone cry.
1, 7, Amy, You did your best, Bender.
1, 7, Bender, Up yours, bimbo!
1, 7, Zoidberg, Let's face it, we're in hot butter here. We should call Leela for help.
1, 7, Bender, Cram it, lobster!  That is a good idea. I'll go call her.
1, 7, Fry, She'll never help me. She's still mad that I told her never to help me.
1, 7, Amy, C'mon. Leela's not the type to hold a grudge.
1, 7, Operator, Collect call from...
1, 7, Bender, I'm not giving my name to a machine.
1, 7, Leela, I'll accept.
1, 7, Bender, Fry's in trouble...
1, 7, Bender, And he needs help. Now, I don't like you and you don't like me.
1, 7, Leela, I like you.
1, 7, Bender, You do? Look, are you going to help or not?
1, 7, Leela, I don't know why I should. I mean after what he--
1, 7, Bender, Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What is it you like best about me?
1, 7, Amy, Is she coming?
1, 7, Bender, I'm not sure. But I do know that she likes my in-your-face attitude.
1, 7, Fry, What the hell is that?
1, 7, Bont, Its the Juice-A-Matic 4000. It'll strain my juices from you while filtering out the pulp. By which I mean, your shredded remains.
1, 7, Zoidberg, Of course! Why didn't I think of that!
1, 7, Fry, This is the saddest day of my life. And I still can't cry.
1, 7, Bender, Wait a second. Here comes Leela.
1, 7, Amy, Oh, no! They have her totally outnumbered.
1, 7, Fry, I can't believe it. She's risking her life for me after the way I treated her. I don't deserve this. I feel terrible.
1, 7, Bender, You do? Hmm.
1, 7, Fry, Is she alright?
1, 7, Bender, I don't know. Perhaps I'll look out this window. Oh, dear God in heaven, they're swarming all over her.
1, 7, Fry, No. No!
1, 7, Amy, What are you talking about, Bender? She's al--  (muffled) Oh!
1, 7, Bender, They're strapping her to juicer. Oh, they're putting some ice cubes in the glass under it.
1, 7, Fry, This can't be happening.
1, 7, Bender, It can and, for all you know, it is.  I'm sorry, Fry. She's dead.
1, 7, Fry, All Leela ever wanted to do was help me. But I was to proud, too stupid to accept it.  I wish I had died instead of her.
1, 7, Leela, What are you talking about?
1, 7, Fry, Leela! You're alive!
1, 7, Leela, Of course I'm alive.
1, 7, Bender, I told Fry you were dead so he would cry out the Emperor but you had to go and wreck it by surviving.
1, 7, Amy, We only got two drops.
1, 7, Bont, It's only a matter of time now.
1, 7, Zoidberg, I'll handle this!
1, 7, Leela, Listen, Fry, I think I can get us out of this if you're willing to let me help you.
1, 7, Fry, Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take all the help you're willing to give. I know you just want what's best for me.  Ow! What was that for?  Hey, come on!  That hurt!
1, 7, Leela, I know. Amy, get the bottle.
1, 7, Fry, Oh, now I understand.
1, 7, Leela, Come on. Everybody help out Fry.
1, 7, Fry, Thanks, everybody. I love you all. You guys are true-- Ow! Cut it out, Bender! That's a tender area!
1, 7, Leela, How we doing, Amy?
1, 7, Amy, Great! We're one-tenth of the way there.
1, 7, Amy, OK, it's your turn.
1, 7, Fry, Hey, wait a minute! Who are you?
1, 7, Bont, I'm the Emperor! Thanks for crying me out.
1, 7, Fry, Oh, you're welcome.
1, 7, Bender, Hey! Save some for me!
1, 8, Farnsworth, Good news, everyone. Tomorrow you'll be making a delivery to Ebola 9, the virus planet.
1, 8, Hermes, Why can't they go today?
1, 8, Farnsworth, Because tonight's a special night and I want all of you to be alive. It's the Academy of Inventors' annual symposium.
1, 8, Fry, Wow! I love symposia.
1, 8, Farnsworth, It's the event of the scientific season. Every member presents an invention and the best one wins the Academy prize.
1, 8, Bender, Sounds boring.
1, 8, Farnsworth, Oh, my, yes. But not this year, because my latest invention is unbeatable. Behold! The death clock.  Simply jam your finger in the hole and this read-out tells you exactly how long you have left to live.
1, 8, Leela, Does it really work?
1, 8, Farnsworth, Well it's occasionally off by a few seconds. What with free will and all.
1, 8, Fry, Sounds like fun. How long do I have left to live?
1, 8, Bender, Ooh! Dibs on his CD player!
1, 8, Farnsworth, Oh, my, yes.
1, 8, Fry, Who's the gross nerd?
1, 8, Farnsworth, That's me at the very first symposium. I'm the Academy's oldest living member, you know. These youngsters all look up to me.
1, 8, Wernstrom, Well, well, well. Look who decided to show his wrinkled face.
1, 8, Farnsworth, Why don't you just leave me alone, Wernstrom?
1, 8, Wernstrom, Face it, Farnsworth, you're over the hill. It's time to leave science to the 120-year-olds.
1, 8, Farnsworth, You young turks think you know everything. I was inventing things when you were barely turning senile.
1, 8, Wernstrom, Go home before you embarrass yourself, old man. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to take a nap before the ceremonies.
1, 8, Fry, Who's that jerk?
1, 8, Farnsworth, A hundred years ago he was my most promising student at Mars University. But then, after one fateful pop-quiz...
1, 8, Wernstrom, A-minus? No one gives Ogden Wernstrom an A-minus!
1, 8, Farnsworth, I'm sorry, but penmanship counts.
1, 8, Wernstrom, I swear I'll have my revenge even if it takes me a hundred years.
1, 8, Farnsworth, And here it is
1, 8, Bender, I've been perusing your fortified wine list and I've selected the '71 Hobo's Delight, the '57 Chateau Parté and the '66 Thunder Chevitz.
1, 8, Waiter, Exquisite choices, sir.
1, 8, Bender, And mix them all together in a big jug.
1, 8, Popeil, Welcome to this year's Academy of Inventors Annual Symposium. I'm your host, Ron Popeil, inventor of Mr. Microphone, the spray-on toupee and, of course, the technology to keep human heads alive in jars.  But wait, there's more. We've got a whole line-up of inventors tonight, starting with that up and coming young star, Ogden Wernstrom.
1, 8, Bender, More wine!
1, 8, Wernstrom, Distinguished members of the Academy, I present to you, the Reverse Scuba Suit. Observe!  Fetch!  Now, sit!  I said sit!  Bad fish!
1, 8, Fry, Don't worry, Professor, it's no competition for your death clock.
1, 8, Wernstrom, And what will you be presenting this evening, grandpa?
1, 8, Farnsworth, Let's just say it'll put you young whippersnappers in your place!
1, 8, Wernstrom, I just hope it's not as lame as that death clock you presented last year.
1, 8, Farnsworth, Uh, last year, you say?
1, 8, Wernstrom, That's right.
1, 8, Farnsworth, Oh, my! Did it put you young whippersnappers in your place?
1, 8, Wernstrom, Hardly! We laughed until our teeth fell out. Come along, Cinnamon.
1, 8, Farnsworth, Oh, dear. I'll have to invent something new in the next ten minutes. Perhaps some sort of death clock.
1, 8, Leela, Uh, Professor...?
1, 8, Popeil, Our last presentation comes from our oldest member, Professor Hubert Farnsworth. Professor?
1, 8, Farnsworth, Just a second, just a second.
1, 8, Wernstrom, Pencils down, prune-face.
1, 8, Farnsworth, Uh, yes, here I am, OK, now, hello there. Now, we all know telescopes allow us to see distant objects. But what if we want to smell distant objects? Well now we can! Thanks to my new invention ... the Smellescope.
1, 8, Man, Oh, I say!
1, 8, Farnsworth, The odour travels past this coffee stain here, around the olive pit and into this cigar burn. And this appears to be a doodle of myself as a cowboy.  But the Smellescope is brilliant, I tell you! Think of the astronomical odours you'll smell thanks to me.  Oh, my!
1, 8, Wernstrom, I've waited a hundred years for this, Farnsworth. I give your invention the worst grade imaginable
1, 8, Popeil, And now for the presentation of the award. Listen, folks, I'm practically giving this prize away to Dr. Wernstrom, for his fish thingy.
1, 8, Farnsworth, Perhaps 149 is just too old to be a scientist.
1, 8, Bender, Yep!
1, 8, Fry, No, Professor, don't give up. There were plenty of times in my century when I was gonna give up but I never did. Never! Hey, are you even listening to me? Oh, I give up!
1, 8, Farnsworth, By God, you're right! I'm going to build that Smellescope!
1, 8, Farnsworth, Eureka!
1, 8, Fry, Did you build the Smellescope?
1, 8, Farnsworth, No, I remembered that I'd built one last year. Go ahead, try it. You'll find that every heavenly body has its own particular scent. Here, I'll point it at Jupiter.
1, 8, Fry, Smells like strawberries.
1, 8, Farnsworth, Exactly! And now Saturn.
1, 8, Fry, Pine needles. Oh, man, this is great! Hey, as long as you don't make me smell Uranus.
1, 8, Leela, I don't get it.
1, 8, Farnsworth, I'm sorry, Fry, but astronomers renamed Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke once and for all.
1, 8, Fry, Oh. What's it called now?
1, 8, Farnsworth, Urectum. Here, let me locate it for you.
1, 8, Fry, No, no, I think I'll just smell around a bit over here!  Hmm.  Hmm.
1, 8, Farnsworth, What is it?  Oh, jeez! Oh, man! Remarkable! A stench so foul it's right off the Funk-o-Meter. I dare say Fry may have discovered the smelliest object in the known universe.
1, 8, Bender, Ooh! Ooh! Name it after me!
1, 8, Leela, I think it's moving.
1, 8, Farnsworth, Hmm. Perhaps the computer can calculate its trajectory.  My God! Whatever it is, it's headed straight for us. With enough force to reduce this entire city to a stinky crater. We have less than 72 hours.
1, 8, Bender, Well, let's get looting!
1, 8, Fry, So this thing's gonna destroy the whole city?  What the heck is it?
1, 8, Farnsworth, Ah! Just as I thought. The answer lies in this movie I found on the Internet.
1, 8, Narrator, New York City
1, 8, Fry, Wow! You got that off the Internet?  In my day the Internet was only used to download pornography.
1, 8, Farnsworth, Actually that's still true.
1, 8, Female Scientist, Now that the garbage is in space, doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions.
1, 8, Male Scientist, With gusto!
1, 8, Farnsworth, So that's the situation. Due to the short-sightedness of Old New York, New New York is going to be destroyed by a giant ball of garbage.
1, 8, Leela, Fry, what the hell were you people thinking back then? How could you just throw your garbage away?
1, 8, Fry, Hey, gimmie a break! What do you do with it?
1, 8, Leela, We recycle everything. Robots are made from old beer cans.
1, 8, Bender, Yeah! And this beer can is made outta old robots.
1, 8, Leela, And that sandwich you're eating is made of old discarded sandwiches.  Nothing just gets thrown away.
1, 8, Fry, The future is disgusting.
1, 8, Leela, Typical 20th century attitude.
1, 8, Fry, Hey! You have no right to criticise the 20th century. We gave the world the lightbulb, the steamboat and the cotton gin.
1, 8, Leela, Those things are all from the 19th century.
1, 8, Fry, Yeah, well, they probably just copied us.
1, 8, Farnsworth, Please! There's no time for this now. This is an emergency. We must warn the mayor.
1, 8, Poopenmeyer, Garbage ball, huh? That sounds serious.
1, 8, Farnsworth, Very serious, Mayor Poopenmeyer.
1, 8, Poopenmeyer, I gotta be sure this isn't another scientific fraud like global warming or second-hand smoke.  Send in my science advisor.
1, 8, Farnsworth, Wernstrom!
1, 8, Wernstrom, Well, well, well! Come to present your latest napkin, Professor?
1, 8, Farnsworth, No, I'm here because a giant trash ball is heading straight for us. Smell for yourself.
1, 8, Poopenmeyer, Hey! Holy jeez!
1, 8, Wernstrom, That smell could be anything; a faulty stench coil, some cheese on the lens, who knows?
1, 8, Woman, Mr. Mayor, we just got this transmission from Neptune.
1, 8, Man, Giant ... garbage ball ...  ... passed close by ... horrible stench.
1, 8, Woman, The transmission cuts out there, sir.  No, I, guess it keeps going.
1, 8, Woman, There we go.
1, 8, Poopenmeyer, My God! The senile old man is right.
1, 8, Wernstrom, Do you mean him or me?
1, 8, Poopenmeyer, Him!
1, 8, Linda, Next, New New York in crisis. Morbo?
1, 8, Morbo, Thanks, human female. Puny Earthlings were shocked today to learn that a ball of garbage will destroy their pathetic city of New New York.
1, 8, Linda, Makes me glad we live here in Los Angeles.
1, 8, Morbo, Morbo agrees!
1, 8, Leela, Can't we just shoot a missile at it?
1, 8, Military Man, We've simulated that on a supercomputer but the ball is just too damn gooey. A missile would go right through it.
1, 8, Farnsworth, But suppose we send a crew to plant an explosive precisely on the fault line between this mass of coffee grounds and this deposit of America Online floppy disks.
1, 8, Military Man, In theory, it could work.
1, 8, Wernstrom, Uh, in theory, perhaps. But you'll never find a crew willing to take on a mission so suicidally dangerous.
1, 8, Bender, Oh, crap!
1, 8, Farnsworth, Now, you'll only have one chance to destroy the ball. After that, it will be so close to Earth that blowing it up would cause garbage to rain over the entire planet, killing billions.
1, 8, Bender, Oh, boo-hoo!
1, 8, Farnsworth, Now here's the bomb I've prepared. Once you activate it, you'll have 25 minutes to get away.
1, 8, Leela, That's all? But--
1, 8, Farnsworth, Now, now, there'll be plenty of time to discuss your objections when and if you return.
1, 8, Leela, Odour at magnitude 8.  Magnitude 12.  Magnitude 31.  We're breaking up. Turn on the anti-smell device.
1, 8, Fry, Hmm, sporty!
1, 8, Fry, Wow!
1, 8, Leela, Look at all this filth.
1, 8, Fry, It's not filth. It's a glorious monument to the achievements of the 20th century.  Look! A real Beanie Baby.  Oh! A Mr. Spock collector's plate!  Some Bart Simpson dolls!
1, 8, Doll, Eat my shorts!
1, 8, Bender, OK   Mmm! Shorts!
1, 8, Leela, Fry, this stuff was garbage when it was new. Let's blow it up already!
1, 8, Fry, This junk isn't garbage! I can dig in any random pile and find something great.
1, 8, Fry, Alright, let's get to work.
1, 8, Leela, Let's see. If that's Hypodermic Ridge then the bomb must go right here.  Get ready to run. We've got 25 minutes. [She presses the button and the timer changes to 15
1, 8, Bender, There's your problem. The Professor put the counter on upside-down.
1, 8, Leela, That idiot! It wasn't set for 25 minutes, it was set for 52 seconds.
1, 8, Fry, We're gonna die! (calmly) Right?
1, 8, Bender, Right!
1, 8, Bender, It's gonna blow!
1, 8, Leela, Hey, watch it! You'll put somebody's eye out!
1, 8, Bender, OK, OK, keep your space pants on. I'll take care of this.
1, 8, Fry, We're saved!
1, 8, Leela, Yeah, but this garbage ball's unstoppable now. New New York is done for.
1, 8, Linda, All in all, this is one day Mittens the kitten won't soon forget!
1, 8, Morbo, Kittens give Morbo gas. In lighter news, the city of New New York is doomed. Blame rests with known human Professor Hubert Farnsworth and his tiny, inferior brain.
1, 8, Farnsworth, Oh, how could I have put that bomb timer on upside-down? I could swear I followed the manual precisely.  I'm a dried up husk of a scientist. This is all my fault.
1, 8, Fry, No, it's my fault too. I'm sure I threw out more than my share of that trash up there. Also, one month my toilet broke and it just went straight in the garbage can.  Leela was right. The people of the 20th century were idiotic slobs. Especially me.
1, 8, Poopenmeyer, Enough! You all failed miserably. It's time to put a real scientist in charge.
1, 8, Farnsworth, Wernstrom!
1, 8, Wernstrom, The very same.
1, 8, Poopenmeyer, Dr. Wernstrom, can you save my city?
1, 8, Wernstrom, Of course. But it'll cost you. First I'll need tenure.
1, 8, Poopenmeyer, Done.
1, 8, Wernstrom, And a big research grant.
1, 8, Poopenmeyer, You got it.
1, 8, Wernstrom, Also, access to a lab and five graduate students, at least three of them Chinese.
1, 8, Poopenmeyer, Um, alright done. What's your plan?
1, 8, Wernstrom, What plan? I'm set for life! Au revoir, suckers!
1, 8, Leela, That rat! Do something!
1, 8, Poopenmeyer, I wish I could but he's got tenure!
1, 8, Poopenmeyer, It's time to take action.  Stephanie, cancel the maid for today. Have her come tomorrow.  Well, I'm out of ideas. Anyone?
1, 8, Farnsworth, Wait! If we could build an object the exact size, density and consistency of the garbage ball, it might just knock the ball away without smashing it to bits.
1, 8, Leela, But where can we find a substance the exact density and consistency as garbage?
1, 8, Farnsworth, Alas, I don't know.
1, 8, Fry, Uh, what about garbage?
1, 8, Farnsworth, Good Lord! A second ball of garbage! That just might work!
1, 8, Poopenmeyer, But garbage isn't something you just find lying in the streets of Manhattan. This city's been garbage-free for 500 years!
1, 8, Fry, Then it's time to make some more.
1, 8, Poopenmeyer, Make garbage? But how?
1, 8, Fry, Stand back and watch the master! This Slurm can.  Now it's garbage. These papers.  Garbage. This picture of your wife.  Pure garbage. Now you try it.
1, 8, Poopenmeyer, By God, I think the boy's got something. Come on, everyone! The fate of the city is at stake!
1, 8, Fry, Good!  Don't finish that cruller, throw it away  Bender. Drink that beer and drop the bottle on the ground.  Very nice.
1, 8, Poopenmeyer, Get that robot some more beer!  We've trashed this room but that's just the start. We've got to get Fry's message to the people.
1, 8, Fry, People of New New York, take a lesson from the 20th century. Stop all this pain-in-the-ass recycling and throw your garbage on the floor.
1, 8, Fry, Go ahead. Just chuck it any old place like I used to. Your city is counting on you.
1, 8, Farnsworth, If my calculations are correct, this garbage ball will knock the other garbage ball directly into the sun.
1, 8, Wernstrom, And if my calculations are correct, we're all going to die horribly.
1, 8, Poopenmeyer, Alright, places everyone. Prepare for launch.
1, 8, Farnsworth, Five, four, three, two, three, four, five, six...
1, 8, Leela, Just fire the damn thing.
1, 8, Fry, Oops!
1, 8, Farnsworth, Burning garbage!
1, 8, Fry, It worked!
1, 8, Poopenmeyer, And so, on behalf of the entire city, I thank you, Professor Farnsworth. I now present you with the Academy prize, which we confiscated from Dr. Wernstrom after it became apparent that he was a jackass.
1, 8, Farnsworth, Yes! In your face, Wernstrom!
1, 8, Wernstrom, I'll get you, Farnsworth. Even if it takes me another hundred years.
1, 8, Poopenmeyer, And, Fry, we owe you a tremendous debt as well. If not for your 20th century garbage-making skills, we'd all be buried under 20th century garbage.
1, 8, Leela, Should we really be celebrating? I mean, what if the second garbage ball returns to Earth like the first one did?
1, 8, Fry, Who cares? That won't be for hundreds of years.
1, 8, Farnsworth, Exactly! It's none of our concern.
1, 8, Fry, That's the 20th century spirit!
1, 9, Fry, This is awesome! I've been waiting a thousand years to see a Beastie Boys show.
1, 9, Bender, Can I get anybody a beer?
1, 9, Fry, Sure!
1, 9, Announcer, Ladies and gentlemen, here to lay down some old, old, incredibly old school beats
1, 9, Beastie Boys, Well now don't you tell to smile,You stick around,,I'll make it worth your whileGot numbers beyond what you can dial,Maybe it's because I'm so versatile,Style profile I said,It always brings me back when I hear Wu Child...
1, 9, Leela, Impressive. They're busting mad rhymes with an 80% success rate.
1, 9, Bender, I believe that qualifies as ill. At least from a technical standpoint.
1, 9, Fry, Will you guys shut up! I'm trying to look cool.
1, 9, Beastie Boys, ...known for the Flintstone FlopTammy D gettin' biz on the crop,Beastie Boys know to let the beat...
1, 9, Mike, Drop!  Ow! How's it going?  Enjoying the show? Ow!   Don't forget to pick up a T-shirt!
1, 9, Fry, Wow! An old-fashioned mosh pit! Come on, guys. Tonight we're gonna party like its 1999 ... again.
1, 9, Beastie Boys, Well it's 50 cups of coffee and you know it's onI move the crowd to the break of break of dawn...
1, 9, Leela, Ow! Hey, watch it!
1, 9, Fry, Man, these guys rock harder than ever!
1, 9, Mike, Oh, my...
1, 9, MCA, It's a mirage...
1, 9, Ad-Rock, Tellin' you all it's a...
1, 9, Beastie Boys, Sabotage!
1, 9, Ad-Rock, Sabotage, yeah!
1, 9, Mike, Peace, we out!
1, 9, Fender, Hey, Bender!
1, 9, Bender, Hey, Fender! Man, I haven't seen you since high school. You still workin' at Jack In The Box?
1, 9, Fender, Not anymore, baby. I'm with the band!
1, 9, Mike, Aw! Oh, yeah!
1, 9, Fender, Hey, fellas, hey. I want you to meet my friends, Bender, Fry and Leela.
1, 9, Ad-Rock, Y'know, we're really not that interested in meeting them.
1, 9, Fry, Wow! I love you guys! Back in the 20th century, I had all five of your albums.
1, 9, Ad-Rock, That was a thousand years ago. Now we got seven.
1, 9, Fry, Cool! Can I borrow the new ones? And a couple of blank tapes?
1, 9, Fender, Hey, Bender, why don't we ditch these organ sacks and hit the real party?
1, 9, Bender, Count me in! I'm gonna drink till I reboot!
1, 9, Bender, Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.
1, 9, Fender, Don't be a drag, man. We're jacking on!  Aw, yeah!  Wanna jolt?
1, 9, Bender, Uh, hey, I'm no square but isn't that counter-indicated by my operations manual?
1, 9, Robot, Counter indicated!
1, 9, Fender, Come on, Bender, grab a jack. I told these guys you were cool.
1, 9, Bender, Well, if jacking on'll make strangers think I'm cool, I'll do it!
1, 9, Fender, Easy, baby. You don't wanna get hooked on this stuff.
1, 9, Bender, Eh, no need to worry. I don't have an addictive personality.
1, 9, Fry, Hey, uh, Bender? What are we doing in this bad neighbourhood?
1, 9, Bender, Shut up, square!  I'll just be a minute!
1, 9, Preacherbot, Wretched sinner unit! The path to robot heaven lies here ...  ... in The Good Book 3.0.
1, 9, Bender, Hey! Do I preach to you when you're lying stoned in the gutter? No! So beat it!
1, 9, Fry, Who was that guy?
1, 9, Bender, Your mama! Now shut up and drag me to work!
1, 9, Hermes, Our electric bill's climbing faster than a green snake up a sugar cane. Obviously someone round been wastin' a whole heap a juice! Probably you!
1, 9, Zoidberg, Me?
1, 9, Amy, Good morning, Bender.
1, 9, Bender, None of your business! Get off my back!
1, 9, Amy, What's his problem?
1, 9, Leela, If I didn't know better I'd almost think he was abusing electricity.
1, 9, Fry, Bender? No way!  I definitely would've noticed something.
1, 9, Leela, Bender, why are you spending so much time in the bathroom? Are you jacking on in there?
1, 9, Bender, No! Don't come in!
1, 9, Farnsworth, Good news, everyone! Today you'll be delivering a crate of subpoenas to Sicily 8, the Mob Planet!
1, 9, Bender, Alright, let's get to work! I'll be out in a second.
1, 9, Fry, I know Big Vinnie said he was giving me the kiss of death but I still think he was gay.
1, 9, Leela, Did he use his tongue?
1, 9, Fry, A little.  You OK, Bender?
1, 9, Bender, None of your business! Get off my back!
1, 9, Leela, Uh-oh. There seems to be some sort of electrical disturbance in the Coalsack Nebula.
1, 9, Bender, A what kind of disturbance?
1, 9, Leela, Electrical. Anyway, it's going to take some careful piloting to avoid it.
1, 9, Leela, We're out of control. We're heading straight into the electric field!
1, 9, Fry, What's happening? I-I feel weird!
1, 9, Bender, Come on, universe, you big, mostly empty wuss! Gimmie all the juice you got!  Oh, mama!
1, 9, Bender, What?
1, 9, Leela, Bender, we didn't mind your drinking, or your kleptomania, or your pornography ring.
1, 9, Zoidberg, In fact, that's why we loved you.
1, 9, Leela, But this electricity abuse crossed the line. You almost killed us.
1, 9, Fry, And you made me feel like a jerk for trusting you. Just like when my friend Richie swore he wasn't taking drugs and then he sold me my mom's VCR and then later I found out he was taking drugs. You make me ashamed to be your friend.
1, 9, Bender, You're right. I'm a lost cause.
1, 9, Bender, Maybe there's another way.
1, 9, Bender, Oh, yeah, that's the good stuff.   What am I doing? What have I become? Huh?
1, 9, Preacherbot, I see a lot of fancy robots here today, made of real shiny metal. But that don't impress the Robot Devil, no, sir!
1, 9, Vergerbot, No, sir!
1, 9, Preacherbot, 'Cause if you're a sinner, he's gonna plug his infernal modem in the wall, belchin' smoke and flame. And he's gonna download you straight to Robot Hell!
1, 9, Vergerbot, Straight to hell!
1, 9, Preacherbot, So I ask you
1, 9, Bender, Me.
1, 9, Hermes, And as a further cost-cutting measure, I have eliminated the salt-water cooler.
1, 9, Zoidberg, This is a witch hunt!
1, 9, Bender, Oh, what a beautiful morning,Oh what a beautiful day!(talking) Greetings, friends. Don't we all look nice today?
1, 9, Fry, Great! He's whacked out on electricity again.
1, 9, Bender, No, I'm whacked out on life. My friends, I found religion.
1, 9, Fry, Religion? Is this another scam to get free yarmulkes?
1, 9, Leela, Give him a break, Fry. If this helps Bender clean up his act then I think we should be supportive.
1, 9, Farnsworth, Yes.
1, 9, Amy, Oh, yeah.
1, 9, Hermes, Oh, yes!
1, 9, Zoidberg, Oh, yeah.
1, 9, Bender, Wonderful. Then you'll all come to my exceedingly long, un-air-conditioned baptism ceremony!
1, 9, Preacherbot, We are gathered here today to deliver brother Bender from the cold, steel grip of the Robot Devil unto the cold, steel bosom of our congregation.
1, 9, Robot #2, Tell it, Preacher!
1, 9, Robot #3, That equals true.
1, 9, Preacherbot, Brother Bender, do you accept the principles of Robotology on pain of eternal damnation in Robot Hell?
1, 9, Bender, Yes, I do.
1, 9, Preacherbot, Then I will now baptise you.  Press any key to continue.
1, 9, Bender, Uh, while you're at it, could you touch up this seam?
1, 9, Leela, This is unbelievable. The old Bender never would have taken us out to dinner.
1, 9, Bender, The old Bender's gone. He won't trouble you anymore.
1, 9, Waiter, Would monsieur care to see the wine list?
1, 9, Bender, No poison for us, thanks. I'll stick with good old mineral oil.  Ah! Functional!
1, 9, Hermes, Mon, I'm hungrier than a green snake in a sugar cane field!
1, 9, Bender, Friends! Friends! Surely you're not going to eat before we say Robot Grace?  In the name of all that is good and logical we give thanks for the chemical energy we are about to absorb. To quote the prophet Jerematic
1, 9, Bender, ...0010110012. Amen.
1, 9, Fry, Does that mean we can eat now?
1, 9, Bender, Yes.  But first, since I love you all so much, I'd like to give everyone hugs. Come here, Fry!
1, 9, Fry, Oh, uh, but I don't want to.
1, 9, Bender, Mmm! Mmm! Fry, you're my friend!  Come on, everyone line up for a hug. Let's tear down some emotional walls.
1, 9, Leela, What are you doing to my ship?
1, 9, Bender, Sanctifying it!  There! That ought to convert a few tailgaters.
1, 9, Fry, Bender's stupid religion is driving me nuts.
1, 9, Leela, Amen.
1, 9, Farnsworth, If only he had joined a mainstream religion like Oprah-ism or Voodoo.
1, 9, Fry, We've got to get the old Bender back.
1, 9, Leela, And I think I know a way to do it. We have to reacquaint him with a little thing called sleaze.
1, 9, Bender, I can't believe somebody hired an interstellar spaceship to deliver a package to Atlantic City. What are we delivering anyway?
1, 9, Fry, Uh, this.
1, 9, Bender, Where are we delivering it to?
1, 9, Leela, Uh, here.
1, 9, Bender, Another job well done. Now back to the office for an enjoyable evening of fasting and repentance.
1, 9, Fry, Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Bender. So long as we're here why don't we take in some exotic dancing?
1, 9, Leela, Hey, great idea!
1, 9, Bender, But ... those girls don't wear cases. You can see their bare circuits.
1, 9, Fry, Come on, it'll be fun! Maybe we could even drink a little fortified wine.
1, 9, Bender, What? Drinking wine is a sin. Even if it is deliciously fortified.
1, 9, Leela, Hey, Bender, look at that woman's purse. It's hanging by a spaghetti strand.
1, 9, Bender, Thou shalt not snatch.
1, 9, Fry, And there's Hookerbot 5000. She's got a heart of solid gold!
1, 9, Hookerbot, Hey, sailing unit!
1, 9, Bender, Stop tempting me! For once in my life I have inner peace.
1, 9, Fry, Pfft! That's for losers. C'mon, sin your heart out.
1, 9, Leela, Go nuts.
1, 9, Hookerbot, Live a little.
1, 9, Woman, Could you hold my purse for a minute?
1, 9, Fry, Go for it, Bender. You know you wanna!
1, 9, Bender, Well...
1, 9, Bender, I'm the greatest.  Woo-hoo!
1, 9, Fry, Look's like we got the old Bender back!
1, 9, Bender, You know it, pork pie! Except for one thing.
1, 9, Bender, Y'know, as a major Hollywood director, I'll be holding auditions tonight for my next movie. And even though you're all young and naive, I think you might just have what it takes.  Hey! I'm trying to score here! Can't you read the Do Not Disturb sign?  No! No!
1, 9, Robot Devil, Greetings, Bender! Welcome to Robot Hell.
1, 9, Leela, What in hell happened to Bender?
1, 9, Fry, Well he didn't check out. The ashtray's still here.  Look, Nibbler's caught the scent of vodka and motor oil! Go, boy. Follow that stench.
1, 9, Bender, I'm hallucinating this, right?
1, 9, Robot Devil, No, Bender. Robot Hell is quite real. Here's our brochure.
1, 9, Bender, But I don't belong here. I don't like things that are scary and painful.
1, 9, Robot Devil, Sorry, Bender, you agreed to this when you joined our religion. If you sin you go to Robot Hell, for all eternity.
1, 9, Bender, Aw, hell-- I mean heck!
1, 9, Robot Devil, It's alright, you can say that here.
1, 9, Fry, Wait! I remember this place. They shut it down after all those people caught salmonella from the flume ride.
1, 9, Leela, Hmm. Look! It's the symbol of Bender's old religion.
1, 9, Fry, Unbelievable. It's an actual, factual Robot Hell.
1, 9, Leela, Who would've thought hell would really exist? And that it would be in New Jersey!
1, 9, Fry, Actually--
1, 9, Robot Devil, We know all your sins, Bender. And for each one we've prepared an agonising and ironic punishment. Gentlemen?
1, 9, Bender, Aw, crap, singing. Mind if I smoke?
1, 9, Robot Devil, Cigars are evil,You won't miss 'em,We'll find ways to simulate that smell,What a sorry fella,Rolled up and smoked like a panatela,Here on level one of Robot Hell!
1, 9, Robot Devil, Gambling's wrong and so is cheating,So is forging phoney IOU's,Let's let Lady Luck decide,What type of torture's justified,I'm pit boss here on level two!
1, 9, Robot Devil, Ooh! Deep-fried robot!
1, 9, Bender, Just tell me why.
1, 9, Robot Devil, Please read this 55-page warrant.
1, 9, Bender, There must be robots worse than I.
1, 9, Robot Devil, We've checked around, there really aren't.
1, 9, Bender, Then please let me explain,My crimes were merely boy-ish pranks.
1, 9, Robot Devil, You stole from boy scouts, nuns and banks!
1, 9, Bender, Ah, don't blame me,Blame my upbringing!
1, 9, Robot Devil, Please stop sinning while I'm singing!
1, 9, Robot Devil, Selling bootleg tapes is wrong,Musicians need that income to survive.
1, 9, Beastie Boys, Hey, Bender, gonna make some noise,With your hard drive scratched by the Beastie Boys!That's whatcha, whatcha, whatcha get on level five!
1, 9, Fry, I don't feel well.
1, 9, Leela, It's up to us to rescue him.
1, 9, Fry, Maybe he likes it here in Hell.
1, 9, Leela, It's us who tempted him to sin.
1, 9, Fry, Maybe he's back at the motel.
1, 9, Leela, Come on, Fry, don't be scared,I'm sure at least one of us will be spared,So just sit back, enjoy the ride.
1, 9, Fry, My ass has blisters from the slide.
1, 9, Robot Devil, Fencing diamonds,Fixing cockfights,Publishing indecent magazines,
1, 9, Robot Devil, You'll pay for every crime,Knee-deep in electric slime,You'll suffer till the end of time,Enduring torture's, most of which rhyme,Trapped forever here in Robot Hell!
1, 9, Robot Devil, Of course, that's just for starters.
1, 9, Fry, Bender, are you alright?
1, 9, Bender, No! Oh, they're tormenting me with up-tempo singing and dancing.
1, 9, Leela, Alright, Beelzebot, what'll it take to get our friend back?
1, 9, Robot Devil, Sorry, but I hold all the cards here. There's nothing I can do. Now, if you'll just sign this fiddle contest waiver.
1, 9, Leela, Wait. What fiddle contest?
1, 9, Robot Devil, The Fairness In Hell Act of 2275 requires me to inform you that if you can best me in a fiddle contest, you win back Bender's soul. As well as a solid gold fiddle.
1, 9, Fry, Wouldn't a solid gold fiddle weigh hundreds of pounds and sound crummy?
1, 9, Robot Devil, Well it's mostly for show.
1, 9, Leela, Do you know how to play the fiddle?
1, 9, Fry, No. Do you?
1, 9, Leela, No, but I used to play the drums. They're sorta similar.  What happens if we lose?
1, 9, Robot Devil, You'll only win a smaller, silver fiddle. Also I guess I'll kill one of you, uh, him.
1, 9, Leela, We'll do it.
1, 9, Robot Devil, Very well, then. Beat this.
1, 9, Bender, Well, we're boned.
1, 9, Robot Devil, Your turn.  Ha!
1, 9, Leela, Time for the drum solo!
1, 9, Fry, Run!
1, 9, Robot Devil, Stop them! They cheated!
1, 9, Leela, Hurry, Bender!
1, 9, Bender, I could if you'd drop the stupid gold violin!
1, 9, Leela, Oh, sorry.
1, 9, Bender, Don't worry, guys, I'll never be too good or too evil again. From now on, I'll just be me.
1, 9, Leela, Uh, do you think you could be just little less evil than that.
1, 9, Bender, I don't know. Do you think you could survive a 700ft fall?
1, 9, Fry, Good old Bender!
1, 9, Beastie Boys, Yeah, yeah! This one goes out to my man, Bender,Sending this one out, special dedication,To all my peoples in the robot homeworld,Yeah, yeah! Big up with the Professor,My man, Dr. Zoidberg,I'd like to shout out-- a personal shout out to Leela,Fry! My man, Bender,Nibber, Nibbler, in the house,Big shout out to all Futurama!
1, 10, Leela, That was the worst delivery ever.
1, 10, Fry, Yeah. I'm never going to another planet called Cannibalon!
1, 10, Bender, Me neither.  Food was good, though.
1, 10, Farnsworth, Oh, great news, everyone.
1, 10, Bender, Shove it! We quit!
1, 10, Farnsworth, In that case I'll have to hire a new crew to go on our company vacation.
1, 10, Leela, Vacation?
1, 10, Bender, Alright!
1, 10, Fry, This is great! I haven't had time off since I was 21 through 24.
1, 10, Farnsworth, It's just my way of thanking you for not reporting my countless violations of safety and minimum wage laws.
1, 10, Bender, Aww, you!
1, 10, Farnsworth, I've booked us all on the maiden voyage of the largest, most luxurious space cruise ship ever built.  The Titanic!
1, 10, Leela, Looks nice.
1, 10, Fry, Hey, uh, where's my suitcase?  Ow!
1, 10, Poopenmeyer, As Mayor of New New York, it's my pleasure to introduce the honorary captain for the Titanic's maiden voyage. A man who single-handedly defeated the Retiree People of the Assisted Living Nebula
1, 10, Leela, Oh, God! Not Zapp Brannigan!
1, 10, Zoidberg, You know Zapp Brannigan?
1, 10, Leela, Let's just say we've crossed paths.
1, 10, Bender, Was that before or after you slept with him?
1, 10, Zapp, She's a beautiful ship, alright. Shapely ... seductive. I'm gonna fly her brains out.  And now, without further adieu, I christen this ship, Titanic.
1, 10, Zapp, Well, well, well! The Lady Leela. Take notes, Kif. You're about to witness the subtle waltz known as seduction.  So, trapped on a ship with me. What say you and I knock some very sensual boots?
1, 10, Leela, It's tempting, but, uh, I have a fiancé now. Uh, hmm, uh, hmm, uh, we--, uh ...  Him! Fry, darling, meet Zapp Brannigan.
1, 10, Fry, Huh?  Ooh! How do you do?
1, 10, Farnsworth, Ah, here's my stateroom.
1, 10, Bender, Come on, where is it?
1, 10, Farnsworth, Now, Hermes, you and your lovely wife, LaBarbara, have the suite through there. And Dr. Zoidberg, your marble tank is on the other side.
1, 10, Fry, Man, first class seems nice!
1, 10, Farnsworth, It'll seem even nicer once you've seen your room.
1, 10, Amy, Looks like we're on the Fiesta Deck.
1, 10, Leela, This is it.
1, 10, Fry, Well at least we get a window!
1, 10, Bender, Well, I'm tired of this room and everyone in it. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna pop over to the casino for the next 135 hours!
1, 10, Amy, I think I'll go and fill up on bisque at the buffet.
1, 10, Fry, I guess that just leaves you and your fake fianc´ ... all alone ... on a romantic cruise.
1, 10, Leela, Take it off or I'll break it off.
1, 10, Fry, OK!
1, 10, Zapp, Captain's inspection!
1, 10, Bender, Hmm.  I'm bettin' it all!  Come on, baby needs a new pair of feet!
1, 10, Croupier, Snake eyes.
1, 10, Bender, No! My cheating unit malfunctioned! You gotta give me a do-over!
1, 10, Croupier, Sorry, the house limit is three do-overs. Next shooter.
1, 10, Bender, Gimmie you're biggest, strongest, cheapest drink.
1, 10, iZac, You got it!
1, 10, Bender, Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Bender.
1, 10, Countess, Charmed. I'm the Countess de la Roca. I was surprised to see another robot staying in first class. Most of the robots I meet are labourers.
1, 10, Bender, I assure you, I barely know the meaning of the word labour.
1, 10, Countess, Oh, Mr. Bender!
1, 10, Bender, Please, call me Bender.
1, 10, Countess, Oh, goodness. I don't--
1, 10, Zapp, Kif, I'm feeling the captain's itch.
1, 10, Kif, I'll get the powder, sir.
1, 10, Zapp, No, the itch for adventure! Prepare to change course.
1, 10, Kif, Sir, this is a leisure cruise. Our path was set by the travel agency.
1, 10, Zapp, That's for schoolgirls! Now here's a route with some chest hair.
1, 10, Kif, But that course leads directly through a swarm of comets.
1, 10, Zapp, Yes, comets! The icebergs of the sky. By jack-knifing from one to the next at breakneck speed we might just get some kind of gravity boost ... or something.  It's time to shove a jalapeño up this ships tailpipe.  Divert power from the shields, full speed ahead!
1, 10, Amy, Oh, yeah!
1, 10, Mrs. Wong, Amy! Hello!
1, 10, Amy, Mom? Dad? What are you doing here?
1, 10, Mr. Wong, We were planning on enjoying a relaxing vacation. But since you're here, we'll have to do some meddling.
1, 10, Mrs. Wong, We met the nicest boy in the cabin next to ours.
1, 10, Mr. Wong, He's not very ugly.
1, 10, Mrs. Wong, You should marry him! Or at least use him to conceive a grandchild for us.
1, 10, Mr. Wong, There he is at the buffet!
1, 10, Amy, Uh, he seems really nice but, well, I already have a boyfriend.
1, 10, Mrs. Wong, Really? Where is he?
1, 10, Mr. Wong, And why isn't he here right now fathering our grandchild?
1, 10, Amy, Uh...
1, 10, Leela, Well, our accommodations aren't great, but it sure is beautiful out here.
1, 10, Fry, Yeah, it's pretty romantic-- Uh, I mean platonic. Th-That sure is one platonic view!
1, 10, Leela, Fry, just be quiet. I'm beginning to think this whole fake fiancé thing was a terrible, terrible--
1, 10, Fry, Hmm? Mmm!
1, 10, Zapp, Leela, perhaps this is an awkward time but if things don't work out with this pipsqueak here ...  ... I just want you to know I'll be there to score you on the rebound.
1, 10, Leela, Uh, look, before you get any crazy ideas, that was for Zapp.
1, 10, Fry, Well, you got anything else for him?
1, 10, Leela, Alright, can we try not to complicate this?
1, 10, Amy, Mom, Dad, I'd like you to meet Fry, my boyfriend.
1, 10, Fry, Hmm? Mmm!
1, 10, Fry, See you later, wuvvums!
1, 10, Leela, It would have been nice if you'd told me you were going out with Amy.
1, 10, Fry, I'm not going out with Amy. It's just to fool her parents. Hey, you're not jealous, are you?
1, 10, Leela, What? No. No! Of course not!
1, 10, Fry, Good, 'cause I consider my fake relationship with you a lot more meaningful.
1, 10, Countess, Mind if I freshen up a bit before we go out?
1, 10, Bender, I was just about to suggest the same thing.  Pay dirt!
1, 10, Countess, Lovely, isn't it?
1, 10, Bender, Yeah. But only 93% as lovely as you.
1, 10, Countess, Oh, Bender! Either that was a computing error or you're the most romantic robot I've ever met!
1, 10, Bender, I don't get it, iZac; that bracelet had a diamond the size of a racoon's brain. Why couldn't I steal it?
1, 10, iZac, It's obvious, Mr. B. You're in love.
1, 10, Bender, Oh, it's true. But we're star-crossed robots. She, a countess, built with a silver spoon in her mouth. And me, just a regular honest Joe.
1, 10, iZac, Hey, you gonna pay for those?
1, 10, Bender, Hell, no!
1, 10, iZac, Security to bar area. Security to bar area.
1, 10, Bender, Fellas, please. I'm in love!
1, 10, iZac, Rough him up!
1, 10, Countess, What are you doing?
1, 10, iZac, This penniless chump was stealing drinks, ma'am.
1, 10, Countess, I see. Here you are, sir.  Keep the change.
1, 10, iZac, You got it!
1, 10, Zoidberg, Aha!
1, 10, Fry, Go, Professor!
1, 10, Amy, Lean back more!
1, 10, Farnsworth, Ow!
1, 10, LaBarbara, Come on, Hermes, you could out-limbo all of these people!
1, 10, Hermes, Don't be a dog heart, woman. You know I can't. Not after what happened.
1, 10, Announcer, Now limbo-ing for the Earth team, Hermes Conrad.
1, 10, Boy, You're my hero, Hermes! I'm gonna be just like you!
1, 10, Hermes, No, boy, stop! It's too low! Your backbone can't take it!
1, 10, Boy, I'm just like Hermes! I'm just like--
1, 10, Hermes, Nooo!
1, 10, LaBarbara, There, there. Now you don't have to limbo if you don't want. It doesn't make you any less of a man.
1, 10, Farnsworth, Though it did get me some action!
1, 10, Hattie, I like a man who's flexible!
1, 10, Zapp, Your attention, please. As captain of this vessel, the terrible burden of naming a limbo contest winner is mine and mine alone.
1, 10, Kif, Shouldn't you be steering between the comets?
1, 10, Zapp, And the winner is, Leela!
1, 10, Leela, But I didn't even limbo.
1, 10, Zapp, No matter. I know from personal experience how horizontal you can get. As your reward, you and that hairpile are invited to dine at the captain's table this evening.
1, 10, Bender, Well, now you know. I'm not actually rich. I'm a fraud. A poor, lazy, sexy fraud. This isn't even a real bow-tie, it's magnetic.
1, 10, Countess, Bender, I don't care whether you have money. I love you for your artificial intelligence and your sincerity simulator.
1, 10, Bender, You do? Really?
1, 10, Zapp, I like your style, Fry. You remind me of a young me. Not much younger, mind you. Perhaps even a couple of years older.
1, 10, Fry, Thank you, sir.
1, 10, Zapp, As a gentleman, I must warn you. If you so much as glance at another woman, I'll be all over Leela like a fly on a pile of very seductive manure.
1, 10, Fry, Well, rest assured, Leela's the only girl for me.
1, 10, Amy, Hey, Fry.
1, 10, Leela, Amy!
1, 10, Amy, Leela!
1, 10, Zapp, Ah, the family Wong. Our party is complete.
1, 10, Leela, What are we gonna do? Fry can't pretend to be both our boyfriends.
1, 10, Fry, Sure I can. I learned how to handle delicate social situations from a little show called Three's Company.
1, 10, Zapp, I'd like to impose a toast on the happy couple. Down the hatch!
1, 10, Mrs. Wong, Hear, hear! Now let's have a kiss!
1, 10, Zapp, Yes, Fry. Plant one on your woman.
1, 10, Fry, Um, let me think. Come and knock on our door, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh. Uh, Mr. Roper--
1, 10, Mr. Wong, What's the hold up? Kiss my daughter already!
1, 10, Farnsworth, Wait, I'm confused. Now tell me, Fry, which one of these ladies are you involved with?
1, 10, Fry, Uh...
1, 10, Kif, Captain, may I have a word with you?
1, 10, Zapp, No.
1, 10, Kif, It's an emergency, sir.
1, 10, Zapp, Come back when it's a catastrophe.  Oh, very well.
1, 10, Amy, Well, with Zapp gone and my parents still here, I suggest Fry give me a nice, convincing kiss.
1, 10, Fry, Ah, now there's something we can all enjoy.
1, 10, Kif, Sir, remember your course correction?
1, 10, Zapp, No.
1, 10, Kif, Well it's proving somewhat more suicidal than we'd initially hoped.
1, 10, Zapp, Kif, old friend, I don't know which disgusts me more
1, 10, Fry, Hey, Leela, why'd you run off from dinner?
1, 10, Leela, I didn't run off. I had plenty of time to finish eating and stroll away while you were kissing Amy.
1, 10, Fry, Oh, look, I'm not actually interested in her if that's what's bothering you.
1, 10, Leela, Oh, are you sure? I mean, she has two eyes, you have two eyes.
1, 10, Fry, I know, we seem like a perfect match, but I just don't feel that way about her.
1, 10, Leela, Nice nebula.
1, 10, Fry, Yeah.
1, 10, Leela, Look's like everybody's got somebody. Except me.
1, 10, Fry, And me.
1, 10, Leela, What was that?  Oh, my God! We're heading straight into a black hole.
1, 10, Fry, Talk about a mood killer!
1, 10, Zapp, Don't blame yourself, Kif. We were doomed from the start. Nothing remains now but for the captain to go down with his ship.
1, 10, Kif, Why, that's surprisingly noble of you, sir.
1, 10, Zapp, No, it's noble of you, Kif!  As of now ...  ... you're in command. Congratulations, captain!
1, 10, Leela, OK. We just have to get from here to the escape pods.
1, 10, Farnsworth, I'm too young to die!
1, 10, Leela, Come on, before it's too late!
1, 10, Bender, You all go without me. I'm gonna take one last look around. You know, for, uh, stuff to steal.
1, 10, Fry, You're going back or the Countess, aren't you?
1, 10, Bender, Alright, I am. But I don't want the others to know. If I don't come back, just say I died robbing some old man.
1, 10, Fry, I'll tell them you went out prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.
1, 10, Bender, I love you, buddy!
1, 10, Bender, Countess? Countess?
1, 10, Countess, Bender!
1, 10, Countess, I fell through the deck.
1, 10, Bender, Are you hurt, my sweet?
1, 10, Countess, No. Luckily a family broke my fall.
1, 10, Bender, Just hang on! I'll take care of that fire!
1, 10, Countess, Bender, you risked your life to save me.
1, 10, Bender, And I'd do it again. And perhaps a third time. But that would be it.  When we kiss, I feel like I'm standing waist-deep in a pool of cold, rising water.
1, 10, Leela, Hurry! The escape pods should be just ahead!
1, 10, Hermes, Faster!
1, 10, Leela, It won't move. And the door release is on the other side.
1, 10, Fry, Then we're dead meat. No one could squeeze under there!
1, 10, Hermes, No one, except a legendary limbo champion.
1, 10, LaBarbara, Oh, Hermes!
1, 10, Hermes, Ooh! It's been a while.  This one is for that little kid who's limbo-ing up in heaven right now.
1, 10, LaBarbara, That's my man, alright, baby, limbo!
1, 10, Hermes, I still got the moves! Zoidberg, lower the door another inch.
1, 10, LaBarbara, Just go on through and hit the release, you hot dog!
1, 10, Hermes, Yes, dear.
1, 10, LaBarbara, That's my man!
1, 10, Amy, Yay, Hermes!
1, 10, Hermes, Uh, can somebody help me up?
1, 10, Countess, Well, now what are we going to do?
1, 10, Bender, Wait a second. Aren't you a member of the yacht club?
1, 10, Countess, By God, you're right! I'm a class-3 yacht.
1, 10, Farnsworth, Thank God there are plenty of escape pods. We won't have to dress up like women and children.
1, 10, Leela, We can't leave yet. We've got to wait for Bender. The high gravity must be slowing down his looting.
1, 10, Mrs. Wong, Amy!
1, 10, Amy, Mom? Dad? You're alive!
1, 10, Mr. Wong, Yeah, but so what? The important thing is we found you a new man.
1, 10, Mrs. Wong, A captain.
1, 10, Amy, Uh, Mom, I don't--  Hi!
1, 10, Kif, Hello!
1, 10, Farnsworth, I don't feel well!
1, 10, Fry, Look! It's our nebula. Whenever I see it I'll think back to that moment when we almost--  Never mind!
1, 10, Hermes, Everyone else is off the ship. Where in Babylon is Bender?
1, 10, Leela, I don't know. But we can't wait any longer.
1, 10, Fry, Goodbye, Bender.
1, 10, Bender, Wait for us!
1, 10, Leela, Something's wrong. We're two metric tons overweight.
1, 10, Amy, Well, it's not me!
1, 10, Fry, Look!
1, 10, Countess, I'm slipping, Bender. The pull is too strong!
1, 10, Bender, I can't live without you. If you let go, I let go!
1, 10, Countess, No! You have too much to live for. It may hurt for a while but one day you'll share your love again. After all, it's shareware.
1, 10, Bender, Don't talk like that. Tragic romances always have a happy ending.
1, 10, Countess, Farewell!
1, 10, Bender, No!
1, 10, Bender, She's gone.
1, 10, Leela, But she saved all our lives. Without her, we're light enough to get away.
1, 10, Fry, Don't cry, Bender. Nobody really knows what happens in a black hole. It's possible she's still alive in another dimension somewhere. Right, Professor?
1, 10, Farnsworth, Oh, yes, absolutely!  Not a chance!
1, 10, Bender, At least I'll always have her bracelet!  What do you think it's worth?
1, 10, Hermes, It's fake, mon!
1, 11, Farnsworth, Good news, everyone.  We've got a very special delivery today.
1, 11, Fry, Who's it going to?
1, 11, Farnsworth, Me.
1, 11, Bender, Another job well done.
1, 11, Farnsworth, No, I need it shipped to my office at Mars University.  It's a little experiment that may well win me the Nobel Prize.
1, 11, Leela, In what field?
1, 11, Farnsworth, I don't care, they all pay the same.
1, 11, Fry, Is it dangerous?
1, 11, Farnsworth, Oh, my, no.  Off we go!
1, 11, Fry, Very impressive. Back in the 20th century we had no idea there was a university on Mars.
1, 11, Farnsworth, Well, in those days Mars was just a dreary, uninhabitable wasteland, uh, much like Utah. But unlike Utah, it was eventually made livable, when the university was founded in 2636.
1, 11, Leela, They planted traditional college foliage; ivy, trees, hemp. Soon the whole planet was terraformed.
1, 11, Fry, Does that mean it's safe to breathe the air?
1, 11, Farnsworth, Of course.
1, 11, Farnsworth, Over here is Wong Library. It has the largest collection of literature in the Western Universe.
1, 11, Bender, Hey, look! There's a chapter of my old robot fraternity, Epsilon Rho Rho.
1, 11, Leela, You went to college?
1, 11, Bender, Of course. I'm a bender, I went to Bending College. I majored in Bending.
1, 11, Fry, What was your minor?
1, 11, Bender, Robo-American Studies.
1, 11, Fratbot #1, Are you here to fumigate the moose head?
1, 11, Bender, Uh, no, actually I'm an Epsilon from way back.
1, 11, Fratbot #1, Eh, close enough. C'mon in.
1, 11, Bender, Thanks. Here's your finger back.
1, 11, Bender, All the coolest robots are in this fraternity.
1, 11, Fratbot #2, Mate in 143 moves.
1, 11, Fratbot #3, Oh, pooh. You win again!
1, 11, Bender, Uh-oh, nerds!
1, 11, Fratbot #1, Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Gearshift, chapter president. This is Oily, and this here is Fat-bot.
1, 11, Bender, You're all losers. My name's Bender.
1, 11, Oily, Bender from Bending State Bender? Wow, you're a legend around here!
1, 11, Fat-bot, I heard that in one single night you drank a whole keg, streaked across campus and crammed 58 humans into a phone booth.
1, 11, Bender, Yeah, well, a lot of 'em were children. Anyway I should get going.
1, 11, Gearshift, No, Bender, wait. We're the lamest frat on campus. Even Hillel has better parties than us. Please, you've gotta stay and teach us how to be cool.
1, 11, Bender, Hmm, OK. But I'll need 10 kegs of beer, a continuous tape of Louie Louie and a regulation two-storey panty-raid ladder.
1, 11, Fat-bot, Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
1, 11, Fry, I tell you, being here really takes me back to my college days.
1, 11, Man #1, Step right up. Who wants to learn physics?
1, 11, Man #2, Keep your hands inside the car at all times.
1, 11, Fry, Good old Coney Island College! Go, Whitefish!
1, 11, Leela, Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but you don't seem like the educated type.
1, 11, Fry, Oh, yeah?  Read it and weep. I'm a certified college dropout.
1, 11, Leela, Please! Everyone knows 20th century colleges were basically expensive daycare centres.
1, 11, Farnsworth, That's true. By current academic standards, you're merely a high school dropout.
1, 11, Fry, What? That's not fair. I deserve the same respect any other college dropout gets. By God, I'm gonna enroll here at Mars University and drop out all over again!
1, 11, Leela, You won't last two weeks.
1, 11, Fry, Aww, thanks for believing in me.
1, 11, Amy, Yo, classmate. What you takin'?
1, 11, Fry, Oh, I don't know.  Hey, Professor, what are you teaching this semester?
1, 11, Farnsworth, Same thing I teach every semester
1, 11, Fry, Mathematics of wanton burrito meals.  I'll be there!
1, 11, Farnsworth, Please, Fry, I don't know how to teach; I'm a professor!
1, 11, Fry, See you in class!
1, 11, Farnsworth, Oh!
1, 11, Fat-bot, This is gonna be great!
1, 11, Bender, Bingo!
1, 11, Fat-bot, Oh, mama!
1, 11, Bender, Oh, yeah! Someone's been a bad computer!  Get a load of that!
1, 11, Meiderneyer, I say, you've damaged our servants' quarters ... and our servants.
1, 11, Chet, This time Robot House has gone too far.
1, 11, Bender, Cheese it!
1, 11, Fat-bot, They're gonna catch us!
1, 11, Fry, Hey, pretty nice for a single. Two desks, two chairs, a couple of beds.  A woodpecker.
1, 11, Leela, I think that's probably your roommate.
1, 11, Fry, Oh, right, cool.  C'mon in, roomie!   What the--?
1, 11, Monkey, I call top bunk!
1, 11, Fry, My roommate's a monkey?
1, 11, Monkey, Brilliant deduction, you're a credit to your species.
1, 11, Farnsworth, Ah, Fry, I see you've met Guenter!
1, 11, Fry, You know each other?
1, 11, Farnsworth, Guenter is my experiment. He was the top secret contents of this stinking crate.
1, 11, Guenter, I'd rather live in a crate than share a room with this dork.
1, 11, Leela, So what makes Guenter talk?
1, 11, Fry, Is he genetically engineered?
1, 11, Farnsworth, Oh, please! That's preposterous science-fiction mumbo-jumbo. Guenter's intelligence actually lies in his electronium hat which harnesses the power of sunspots to produce cognitive radiation.
1, 11, Guenter, You're wasting your breath, Professor. He'll never understand a word of it.
1, 11, Fry, I understood the word hat!
1, 11, Farnsworth, Please, stop bickering. I arranged that you be roommates for a reason
1, 11, Fry, You want a banana?
1, 11, Guenter, I don't eat bananas. I prefer banana-flavoured energy bars made from tofu.
1, 11, Fry, I don't like you.
1, 11, Fry, This is gonna be a cakewalk!
1, 11, Teacher, Welcome to the history of the 20th century. Look to your left, then to your right. Then in nine other directions. One of the 12 of you will not pass this class.
1, 11, Amy, Boring.  Let's hear about Walter Mondale already!
1, 11, Teacher, Be forewarned
1, 11, Fry, Swish!
1, 11, Teacher, You were saying, Mr. Fry?
1, 11, Fry, I'm from the 20th century. Go ahead, ask me anything.
1, 11, Teacher, Very well. What device invented in the 20th century allowed people to view broadcast programmes in their own homes?
1, 11, Fry, Ooh ... I know this ... whatyya call it? Lite Brite!
1, 11, Guenter, I believe the answer is the television.
1, 11, Teacher, Very good, Mr. ...  ... Guenter.
1, 11, Amy, Wow! Smart and cute!
1, 11, Vernon, What I love about being dean of students is the peace and quiet and the respect I receive.  Now what's all this about?
1, 11, Woman, Dean Vernon, the students from Robot House are here.
1, 11, Vernon, Robot House!
1, 11, Bender, Hey, dean, nice looking model.
1, 11, Vernon, You keep away from it. You robots are a disgrace to this university. Whenever a fire alarm is pulled, it's Robot House. Whenever the campus liquor store is looted, Robot House. Whenever a human corpse is desecrated--
1, 11, Bender, Now, I can explain that.
1, 11, Vernon, That's enough out of you. From this day forth, Robot House is on dodecatupple-secret probation!
1, 11, Bender, No fair!
1, 11, Fat-bot, My mom is gonna kill me!
1, 11, Vernon, Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to the one thing that's kept me sane these past eight years
1, 11, Gearshift, Fat-bot! No!
1, 11, Fat-bot, When I get nervous I get hungry.
1, 11, Bender, Cheese it!
1, 11, Vernon, Robot House!
1, 11, Fry, So, Chrissy, we seem to be hitting it off. If you're not doing anything later might I escort you to a kegger?
1, 11, Chrissy, Not even if you were the last man on Mars.
1, 11, Guenter, Hey! You like bananas?
1, 11, Guenter, I got her number. How do you like them bananas?
1, 11, Farnsworth, And therefore, by process of elimination, the electron must taste like grapeade.
1, 11, Fry, Sorry, I overslept.
1, 11, Farnsworth, Until 5pm?
1, 11, Fry, It's that obnoxious monkey. He kept me up all night with his constant thinking. Just thinking and thinking. He's trying to make me look like an idiot.
1, 11, Farnsworth, Don't be jealous. Without his special hat, Guenter might be no more intelligent than you.
1, 11, Fry, I hate that rodent!
1, 11, Farnsworth, Fry, that monkey is my most important experiment. If you two don't stop fighting I'll have you both neutered.
1, 11, Fry, That'll show him.
1, 11, Amy, Dean Vernon, I'd like you to meet my parents, Leo and Inez.
1, 11, Vernon, Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Wong, I'm so glad we could admit Amy in exchange for your generous contribution.
1, 11, Mr. Wong, How much more for Phi Beta Kappa?
1, 11, Vernon, How much you got?
1, 11, Guenter, Sorry I'm late, I was off at a study session ... with Chrissy!
1, 11, Farnsworth, Oh, I'm glad you made it, Guenter because in honour of parents weekend I have a special surprise for you.
1, 11, Guenter, Mom? Dad? What are you doing here?  This is so humiliating.
1, 11, Fry, Now these monkeys I like!  What's that? You wanna come out?
1, 11, Guenter, No! Stop!
1, 11, Chet, I say.
1, 11, Farnsworth, What's that they're flinging at us?
1, 11, Guenter, Oh, dear Lord! All over the dean!
1, 11, Fry, Hey, uh, Guenter? Why don't you get up on the chandelier with your parents and I'll take a picture?
1, 11, Bender, Well, looks like the party's winding down. Let's take a road trip to Tijuana and get Fat-bot some action.
1, 11, Fat-bot, It's my first time, I'm really nervous.
1, 11, Vernon, Robot House!
1, 11, Leela, What you did to Guenter was cruel. At the risk of sounding like an after-school special, I think we learned who the real animal was today.
1, 11, Fry, You mean peer pressure?
1, 11, Fry, Look out! He's got a gun!
1, 11, Guenter, Leave me alone.
1, 11, Leela, Hey, what's going on? I thought you didn't like bananas.
1, 11, Guenter, Of course I do. I try so hard to fit in but seeing my parents act like that made me realise I'm just a primitive beast.
1, 11, Fry, Hey, hey, cheer up. Not everyone turns out like their parents. I mean, look at me. My folks were honest, hard-working people.
1, 11, Leela, Besides, Guenter, you're not like other monkeys. You've got the hat.
1, 11, Guenter, So what? I mean, sure, it looks cool and it makes me smart but it doesn't make me happy.
1, 11, Leela, That's so sad. I didn't even know monkeys could cry.
1, 11, Guenter, They can't. It's all the hat.
1, 11, Fry, Look, Guenter, if you're so miserable here, maybe you should just go back to the jungle.
1, 11, Guenter, The jungle. But I couldn't do that to the Professor. I'm his prize experiment, and he's like a father to me.
1, 11, Leela, But he's not your father. That guy in the punch bowl was your father.
1, 11, Farnsworth, Look at him. I'm so proud.
1, 11, Fry, Thanks, Professor!
1, 11, Farnsworth, Not you.
1, 11, Fry, Ow!
1, 11, Student, Hey!
1, 11, Farnsworth, Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why? Why? Why didn't I break his legs?
1, 11, Farnsworth, Oh, poor Guenter.
1, 11, Leela, So he just ran away in the middle of the exam?
1, 11, Farnsworth, I'm afraid so. All he handed in was a paper smeared with faeces. He tied with Fry.
1, 11, Fry, I guess he realised I was right when I told him to go back to the jungle.
1, 11, Farnsworth, You what? After I spent months slaving over a hot monkey brain?
1, 11, Fry, Hey, don't blame me. You tried to force Guenter to be a human but he's an animal. He belongs in the wild. Or in the circus on one of those tiny tricycles. Now that's entertainment!
1, 11, Farnsworth, But Guenter's obviously better off being intelligent. Tell him, Leela.
1, 11, Leela, Nuh-uh, I'm staying out of this. Now here's my opinion
1, 11, Farnsworth, What?
1, 11, Leela, I said we'll go to the jungle and let Guenter decide once and for all.
1, 11, Farnsworth, What?
1, 11, Vernon, You all know the rules. Whichever house wins the regatta becomes head of the Greek Council. And should that house currently be on any type of multiple secret probation, it will be lifted and I will be forced to serve as Grand Marshal of a parade honouring them.
1, 11, Chet, I say, Robot House, your water craft is as ill-designed as you yourselves.
1, 11, Meiderneyer, Good one, Chet!
1, 11, Bender, Oh, yeah? Watch this!
1, 11, Chet, Well, I never!
1, 11, Vernon, Fraternities, on your marks.
1, 11, Bender, Hey!
1, 11, Fry, Wow! The jungles on Mars look just like the jungles on Earth.
1, 11, Farnsworth, Jungles? On Earth?
1, 11, Leela, I see some movement up there. I think it's him.
1, 11, Farnsworth, Stand back.
1, 11, Leela, Oops.
1, 11, Farnsworth, Don't worry. They'll be fine once the tranquiliser wears off.
1, 11, Fry, There's our man!
1, 11, Leela, Professor, you'll offer Guenter the hat and, Fry, you'll offer him the banana.  We'll let him choose whether he wants to be intelligent or just a mindless animal.
1, 11, Farnsworth, Come on, Guenter, take the hat.
1, 11, Fry, No, the banana, the banana!
1, 11, Farnsworth, Consider the philosophical and metaphysical ramifications of the--
1, 11, Fry, Banana, banana, banana!
1, 11, Leela, Wait, what's that sound?
1, 11, Gearshift, Hey, Bender, you sure this is a short-cut?
1, 11, Bender, Not as sure as I was an hour ago!
1, 11, Vernon, And the winner is ...  ... Robot House?
1, 11, Farnsworth, Oh, dear Lord!
1, 11, Leela, No! No!
1, 11, Farnsworth, Thank God this log is sturdy.   Put on the hat, Guenter! You're the only one who can save us!   Stupid monkey.
1, 11, Fry, No.
1, 11, Leela, Not there.
1, 11, Farnsworth, Keep trying.
1, 11, Guenter, Eureka! The hat goes on the head. It's all so obvious now!
1, 11, Leela, Help us, Guenter!
1, 11, Guenter, Oh, my goodness.  Hang on. I need to do some calculations.  Got it!  Grab on!
1, 11, Farnsworth, We're saved!
1, 11, Fry, 'Preciate it, Guenter!
1, 11, Leela, Oh, no! Hurry, Guenter, climb up the vine. You can still save yourself.
1, 11, Guenter, Why bother? I've got nothing to live for. I was miserable as a genius, and as a monkey, I was so dumb I tried to wear a hat on my butt.   There's just no place for me in this world.  Although, on the other hand--
1, 11, Farnsworth, Oh, that poor, sweet monkey. Well, let's go gather him up. There's no sense letting him go to waste.
1, 11, Fry, Guenter! You're alive!
1, 11, Guenter, I guess the hat must have broke my fall.
1, 11, Farnsworth, It seems to be working at only half-capacity, but I can fix it.
1, 11, Guenter, No, wait! I like it like this. I actually feel sort of happy.
1, 11, Farnsworth, But what about your super-intelligence?
1, 11, Guenter, When I had that there was too much pressure to use it. All I want out of life is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit. That's why I've decided to transfer to business school!
1, 11, Farnsworth, Nooo!
1, 11, Bender, Come on, everyone! Big party in Robot House!
1, 12, Fry, Pizza delivery! Wow, so this is a real TV station, huh?
1, 12, Technician, Well, it's a Fox affiliate.
1, 12, Fry, What are you showing right now?
1, 12, Technician, Single Female Lawyer. It's the season finale. Wanna watch?
1, 12, Fry, Ah, I dunno. That's a chick show. I prefer programmes of the genre world's blankiest blank.
1, 12, Technician, She is wearing the world's shortiest skirt.
1, 12, Fry, I'm in!
1, 12, Judge, Counselor, I remind you that it's unethical to sleep with your client. If you really care about the outcome of the case, you should sleep with me.
1, 12, Single Female Lawyer, Your Honour, it's bad enough to proposition a single female lawyer in court, but this is a unisex bathroom.
1, 12, Judge, Overruled, counselor!
1, 12, Stenographer, Could you repeat that last part?
1, 12, Technician, Oh, my God! You've knocked Fox of the air!
1, 12, Fry, Pft! Like anyone on Earth cares.
1, 12, Stenographer, Could you repeat that last par--
1, 12, Lrrr, This is an outrage! I demand to know what happened to the plucky lawyer and her compellingly short garment.
1, 12, Announcer, Due to technical difficulties, we now bring you eight animated shows in a row.
1, 12, Hermes, What in the name of Bob Marley's ghost? Get to work, you lazy boat bag!
1, 12, Bender, Ow!
1, 12, Fry, Ow! Hey, quit it, Hermes. It's Labor Day.
1, 12, Hermes, Labor Day? That phoney-baloney holiday crammed down our throats by fat-cat union gangsters?
1, 12, Fry, That's the one.
1, 12, Hermes, Hot damn, a day off!
1, 12, Leela, Who's up for one last summer beach trip?
1, 12, Bender, Aw, yeah!
1, 12, Hermes, Ready, Freddy!
1, 12, Fry, Eh, I think I'll just stay here.
1, 12, Leela, Fry, you're wasting your life sitting in front of that TV. You need to get out and see the real world.
1, 12, Fry, But this is HDTV. It's got better resolution than the real world!
1, 12, Leela, Everyone's too polite to say anything but you're covered with bed sores.
1, 12, Fry, Not covered!
1, 12, Leela, Just get in the car.
1, 12, Farnsworth, Ah, here we are
1, 12, Fry, Wait, Mount Rushmore and the Leaning Tower of Pisa? I didn't know they were both in New York!
1, 12, Leela, They are now. In the 2600's, New Yorkers elected a super-villain governor, and he stole most of the world's monuments.
1, 12, Bender, Truly a great man. Look at him up there.
1, 12, Hermes, Aha!  Found you!
1, 12, Bender, OK, now you go hide.  Nice knowin' you.
1, 12, Farnsworth, Come on, Zoidberg, I passed it right to you.
1, 12, Zoidberg, I've had it with this game! I'm going for a scuttle!
1, 12, Bender, OK, everyone, come and get it!
1, 12, Fry, Ah, just like my dad used to make ... until McDonald's fired him.
1, 12, Bender, Bite my red-hot glowing ass.  Wait a minute. Red-hot glowing ass?   I'll be right back!  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!  Aw, yeah!
1, 12, Amy, No, Nibbler!   Psst, Professor, I need another bikini.
1, 12, Farnsworth, Eh ... wha?  Oh, oh, OK, I think there's one can left.  Oh, my.
1, 12, Amy, There. How do I look?
1, 12, Farnsworth, Like a cheap French harlot.
1, 12, Amy, French?
1, 12, Bully, Say, doll-face, how'd you like to make time with a real man?
1, 12, Leela, No. I'm not attracted to bullies. No matter how big and ...  ... handsome they are.
1, 12, Fry, It's OK, Leela, go ahead. I got a lot of work to do.
1, 12, Bully, Uh, sir, you don't understand. I'm a professional beach bully. I pretend to steal your girl, you punch me, I go down, she swoons, you slip me 50 bucks.
1, 12, Fry, 50 bucks? Not even if she was my girlfriend. You take her.
1, 12, Leela, Fry! Although I suppose we could go for a walk along the beach.
1, 12, Bully, Uh, no thanks, ma'am, I'm actually gay.
1, 12, Zoidberg, Uh-oh.  Help! Help!  Bender, you gotta spring me. I'll never survive in here; I'm too pretty!
1, 12, Bender, Alright, alright, I'll bust you out.  Cheese it!
1, 12, Fry, Voila. The greatest sandcastle ever built. This is the kind of castle King Arthur would have lived in, if he were a fiddler crab.
1, 12, Leela, It's very nice. We should get a picture before the tide comes in.
1, 12, Fry, Ooh, yeah. Anyone have a camera?
1, 12, Bender, Right here, buddy.  Wait, I wanna be in the picture too.  Pretend you're happy.
1, 12, Zoidberg, Yay!
1, 12, Leela, Oh, my God!
1, 12, Hermes, What in Babylon?
1, 12, Fry, Nooo!
1, 12, Hermes, Faster!
1, 12, Fry, We're all gonna die, aren't we?
1, 12, Farnsworth, Oh, I should think so. Although last time aliens invaded all they did was force the most intelligent of us to pair off and mate continuously.  Oh, yes!
1, 12, Linda, Once again, today's winning lotto number was 4. In other news, alien saucers continue to rain destruction upon Earth. We now go live to an emergency address by Earth President McNeal.
1, 12, McNeal, Ladies and gentlemen, our course is clear. The time has come to knuckle under. To get down on all fours and really lick boot. Give our alien masters whatever they want a--
1, 12, Lrrr, People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8.  Is this thing on?  Now then
1, 12, McNeal, Uh, as I was saying ...  ... mankind would sooner perish than kowtow to outrageous alien demands for this McNeal ... whoever he is. Am I right?  And now, the man who will lead us in our proud struggle for freedom, fresh from his bloody triumph over the pacifists of the Gandhi Nebula, 25-star General Zapp Brannigan!
1, 12, Man, Yeah!
1, 12, Bender, Hey, look, Leela, it's that idiotic windbag you slept with.
1, 12, Leela, The Earth is under attack. Can't we just forget about that?
1, 12, Bender, Evidently not.
1, 12, Zapp, Call me cocky, but if there's an alien out there I can't kill, I haven't met him and killed him yet. But I can't go it alone.  That's why I'm ordering every available ship to report for duty. Anyone without a ship should secure a weapon and fire wildly into the air.
1, 12, Leela, Well, you heard the windbag
1, 12, Bender, Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. I refuse to fight. I'm a conscientious objector.
1, 12, Fry, A what?
1, 12, Bender, You know, a coward.
1, 12, Zapp, Since this is an emergency, all robots will now have their patriotism circuits activated.
1, 12, Bender, It is every robot's duty to give his life for the good of humanity.  Oh, crap!
1, 12, Zapp, We're all from different cultures here. Some of you are white, some of you are black.  You're brown.  And you're silver. But I don't care if your skin's red or tan or Chinese. You're all going to have to learn to die together.  Am I right, soldier?
1, 12, Bender, Well, actually, I--  Sir, yes, sir! Sir!
1, 12, Zapp, Remember, our mission is simple
1, 12, Kif, Um, uh, not me, sir.
1, 12, Zapp, Oh, yes, right. Nobody destroy Kif.  Unless you have to.   Oh, ho, ho! The luscious Captain Leela.  This is turning into one very sex-ay struggle for the future of the human race!
1, 12, Leela, Thanks, but I'm not technically human.
1, 12, Zapp, Right, right. Nobody destroy Leela either.
1, 12, Zapp, The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well-made bed. You will practise until you can make your bed in your sleep.
1, 12, Fry, You mean while I'm sleeping in it?
1, 12, Zapp, You won't have time for sleeping, soldier. Not with all the bed-making you'll be doing.
1, 12, Zapp, The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.  Now, like all great plans, my strategy is so simple an idiot could have devised it. On my command, all ships will line up and file directly into the alien death cannons, clogging them with wreckage.
1, 12, Fry, W-Wouldn't it make more sense to send the robots in first a--
1, 12, Bender, Sir, I volunteer for a suicide mission.  Aw, cut it out!
1, 12, Zapp, You're a brave robot, son. But when I'm in command every mission's a suicide mission. Which reminds me.  Leela, perhaps before we head into battle you'd like to make love to me, in case one of us doesn't come back.
1, 12, Leela, Maybe we should wait till afterwards, in case neither of us comes back.
1, 12, Zapp, Here's hoping.
1, 12, Fry, I'm gonna be a science-fiction hero, just like Uhura, or Captain Janeway, or Xena!
1, 12, Leela, Fry, this isn't TV, it's real life. Can't you tell the difference?
1, 12, Fry, Sure, I just like TV better.
1, 12, Leela, Bender, damage report.
1, 12, Bender, The auxiliary power's out, and they spilled my cocktail.
1, 12, Fry, Alright, scumwads. This one's for Bender's cocktail!
1, 12, Leela, We did it! We won!
1, 12, Bender, Yeah, but it'll never bring back my martini.   Well, who wants a martini?
1, 12, Zapp, Good work, everyone. The mothership is destroyed.
1, 12, Zapp, What the hell is that thing?
1, 12, Kif, It appears to be the mothership.
1, 12, Zapp, Then what did we just blow up?
1, 12, Kif, The Hubble Telescope.
1, 12, Zapp, Stop exploding, you cowards!
1, 12, Leela, This is hopeless.  If we're gonna get blown to bits, we might as well do it in the comfort of our own home.
1, 12, Farnsworth, You'll be the captain, you'll be the delivery boy, and you'll be the alcoholic, foul-mouthed--  Oh, God, you're alive. I mean, thank God you're alive!  Sorry, check back in three days, a week at the most.
1, 12, Lrrr, We want McNeal! Stop stalling!
1, 12, Linda, And now a rebuttal from President McNeal.
1, 12, McNeal, The people of Earth remain united in my refusal to hand over myself. Total annihilation is a small price to pay compared with--
1, 12, Zapp, Here he is! Come and get him!
1, 12, Lrrr, You are not McNeal.
1, 12, Zapp, Huh?
1, 12, McNeal, Huh?
1, 12, Nd-Nd, You are not the one we want.
1, 12, McNeal, Oh, thank you. Thank you, glorious masters! I--
1, 12, Lrrr, Give us McNeal!
1, 12, Zapp, That was McNeal.
1, 12, Nd-Nd, No, McNeal, the single female lawyer.
1, 12, Lrrr, She wears miniskirts and is promiscuous.
1, 12, Zapp, Really?
1, 12, Fry, Miniskirts? That sounds familiar.
1, 12, Lrrr, Surely you know McNeal. She is an unmarried human female struggling to succeed in a human male's world.
1, 12, Zapp, Maybe that's just her excuse for being incompetent.
1, 12, Lrrr, Silence!  We will accept no more decoys.  This is the McNeal.
1, 12, Fry, Wait, I know her.
1, 12, Leela, You do not, you big fat liar. You don't know anyone. All you do is watch TV.
1, 12, Fry, That's where I know her from. She's Jenny McNeal. She was a character on a TV show back in the 20th century, Single Female Lawyer.
1, 12, Bender, Well if they're hoping to see a TV show that hasn't existed for a thousand years, pft, they are royally boned.
1, 12, Lrrr, We will raise your planet's temperature by one million degrees a day, for five days, unless we see McNeal at 9pm tomorrow -- 8 central!
1, 12, Farnsworth, I'm beginning to think there'll be no forced mating at all.
1, 12, Leela, They're going to destroy the entire Earth if they don't see some stupid TV show about some bimbo lawyer?
1, 12, Fry, It's crazy! How could they even know about a show from a thousand years ago?
1, 12, Farnsworth, Well, Omicron Persei 8 is about a thousand light years away. So the electro-magnetic waves would just recently have gotten there. You see--
1, 12, Fry, Magic. Got it.
1, 12, Amy, Check this out
1, 12, Fry, Beer-- I would think.
1, 12, Bender, They must just wanna see that episode. Let's find a tape and give it to 'em.
1, 12, Amy, There aren't any copies left.
1, 12, Farnsworth, No, there wouldn't be. Most videotapes from that era were damaged in 2443 during the Second Coming of Jesus.
1, 12, Fry, Y'know, I saw the first 30 seconds of that episode. If I could make up an ending, maybe we could act it out ourselves.
1, 12, Zoidberg, I could make the costumes.
1, 12, Farnsworth, I have an old five-megawatt broadcasting tower in the attic.
1, 12, Bender, And I, I could be an acting coach!
1, 12, Fry, Let's put on a show.
1, 12, Fry, OK, Leela, you'll be starring as Jenny--
1, 12, Leela, Uh-uh, forget it. A, I'm camera shy; and B, I get tongue tied in front of an audience armed with death rays.
1, 12, Amy, Plus, you don't really have the thighs for a miniskirt.
1, 12, Leela, Gimme the script.
1, 12, Fry, Places, everyone.
1, 12, Amy, OK ... all set!
1, 12, Fry, Lights!  Camera one!  Camera two!  Camera three!
1, 12, Lrrr, Prepare the water cooler, that we may gather around it later and discuss things.
1, 12, Bender, Single Female Lawyer,Fighting for her client,Wearing sexy miniskirts,
1, 12, Bender, And being self-reliant.(talking) Hey, I'm pretty good!
1, 12, Farnsworth, Uh ...  ... Jenny McNeal, you are charged with jury-tampering in last week's case ...  ... on account of your hot, naked affair with the foreman. How do you plead?
1, 12, Leela, Your Honour, I move for a mistrial, on the grounds that I'm also having a hot, naked affair with the foreman of this jury.
1, 12, Hermes, I'll see you during the recess!
1, 12, Lrrr, If McNeal wishes to be taken seriously why does she not simply tear the judge's head off?
1, 12, Nd-Nd, It is true what they say; Women are from Omicron Persei 7, men are from Omicron Persei 9.
1, 12, Farnsworth, Your witness, Prosecutor Ramirez.
1, 12, Zoidberg, Gracias.  Single Female Lawyer, where were you on the night of August 23rd?
1, 12, Leela, Sleeping with you.
1, 12, Zoidberg, Aha!
1, 12, Leela, Uh, g-- uh, getting back to the, uh, matter, uh-uh, if it please the court...  Fry, there's nothing else here. You only wrote two pages of dialogue.
1, 12, Fry, Well, it took an hour to write. I thought it would take an hour to read.
1, 12, Leela, What are we supposed to do now?
1, 12, Fry, I don't know, I don't know. Just say anything. As long as it's compelling, mesmerising, a tour de force.
1, 12, Leela, Uh...
1, 12, Farnsworth, What say you, Single Female Lawyer?
1, 12, Leela, I say ... I'm giving up the law.  And I'm giving up being single. Your Honour, will you marry me?
1, 12, Fry, No, no! Go to commercial!
1, 12, Bender, We'll be back after this word from Crazy Bender's Discount Stereo.
1, 12, Fry, Married? Jenny can't get married.
1, 12, Leela, Why not? It's clever, it's unexpected.
1, 12, Fry, But that's not why people watch TV. Clever things make people feel stupid, and unexpected things make them feel scared.
1, 12, Lrrr, 
1, 12, Fry, You see? TV audiences don't want anything original. They wanna see the same thing they've seen a thousand times before.
1, 12, Bender, Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Fry?
1, 12, Fry, Trust me on this. While other people were out living their lives, I wasted mine watching TV, because deep down I knew it might one day help me save the world. Plus, I would have lost my Workman's Comp if I had gone outside. Now just read these cue cards.
1, 12, Fry, And action!
1, 12, Farnsworth, Miss McNeal, I'm afraid I must decline your offer of marriage. For, you see, I'm dying. Cough, then fall over dead.
1, 12, Zoidberg, My God, he's dead.
1, 12, Leela, I will now make my closing statement. With my fiancé deceased ...  ... I hereby return to my single female lawyer career. No matter what any man says.
1, 12, Hermes, We find the defendant vulnerable yet spunky!
1, 12, Zoidberg, Hooray!
1, 12, Amy, Hooray!
1, 12, Fry, And ... cut!
1, 12, Bender, Single Female Lawyer,Having lot's of sex--(talking) Huh?
1, 12, Lrrr, Attention, McNeal. We are reasonably satisfied with the events we have seen. Overall I would rate it a C+, OK, not great.  As a result, we will not destroy your planet. But neither will we provide you with our recipe for immortality.
1, 12, Fry, Way to overact ,Zoidberg!
1, 12, Lrrr, And now we must return to our planet, to catch the end of a thousand-year-old Leno monologue.
1, 12, Bender, You did it, Fry!
1, 12, Fry, Yep.  It was just a matter of knowing the secret of all TV shows
1, 13, Calculon, Honey unit, I'm home.  Monique!
1, 13, Monique, Calculon!
1, 13, Calculon, Oh, how I wish I could believe that. You may be my evil half-brother, but there's no law against murdering the other half.
1, 13, Announcer #1, All My Circuits will be right back after this word from...
1, 13, Announcer #2, Slurm! It's highly addictive!
1, 13, Trixie, Look! It's Slurms MacKenzie!
1, 13, Dixie, He's the original party worm!
1, 13, Slurms, Whimmy-wham-wham-wazzle! Let's party!
1, 13, Bender, Look at that worm go. Who says there are no more heroes?
1, 13, Slurms, Hey, dudes, you can win a chance to party with me, Slurms MacKenzie, at the Slurm bottling plant on planet Wormulon!
1, 13, Announcer #2, Just look for the winning bottle-cap inside specially-marked cans of Slurm.
1, 13, Trixie, I won!
1, 13, Announcer #2, No purchase necessary unless you wish to enter the contest. Odds of winning mathematically insignificant.
1, 13, Fry, I like those odds.  Rats. Just another tooth.
1, 13, Fry, I gotta find that golden bottle-cap.
1, 13, Leela, I've never seen anyone so addicted to Slurm.
1, 13, Fry, This is nothing. Back in high school I used to drink a hundred cans of cola a week. Right up until my third heart attack.
1, 13, Leela, Bender, what's wrong?
1, 13, Bender, I'm sick.
1, 13, Leela, You poor baby. Let me check if you have a fever.  Ow!
1, 13, Farnsworth, According to Bender's temperature gauge, which I suggest you use next time, Leela, he's running a fever of ... 900 degrees.
1, 13, Hermes, Bender, mon, lie yourself down.  You're payin' for that!
1, 13, Zoidberg, I'll have a look, but I remind you, I'm an expert on humans not robots.
1, 13, Fry, I'm not Bender, I'm Fry.
1, 13, Zoidberg, Really? I though you were the robot.
1, 13, Fry, Nope. Human.
1, 13, Zoidberg, Alright, alright, spare me your life story.  Now what seems to be the trouble?
1, 13, Bender, My tummy hurts and I've been having this burning electrical discharge.
1, 13, Zoidberg, Hmm. Don't worry, you'll be fine.   Oh boy.  I didn't have the heart to tell him
1, 13, Amy, You should try homeopathic medicine, Bender. Take some zinc.
1, 13, Bender, I'm 40% zinc.
1, 13, Amy, Then take some Echinacea or a St. John's wort.
1, 13, Farnsworth, Or a big fat placebo. It's all the same crap.
1, 13, Leela, Hey, what's rattling around in there?
1, 13, Farnsworth, It may well be the cause of Bender's illness. But more importantly, it's a flimsy pretext to try out my latest invention. To the laboratory!
1, 13, Farnsworth, I call this the F-ray. It's like an X-ray only it allows you to see through anything, even metal. Now, the neutrino beam it emits is a tad dangerous, so you'll all need protective goggles.  You may feel a slight stinging sensation -- all of you!  Aha! There's the cause of your illness.
1, 13, Amy, Hey, that's my watch!
1, 13, Bender, I was wondering where I put that.  Hey, now I feel much better! Thanks, Professor. And, Amy, I'm sorry I took your watch.
1, 13, Farnsworth, Well, I've got to go take this suit to the decontaminators. You two lock up the F-ray and for the love of God don't let it fall into the wrong hands.
1, 13, Bender, What should we point it at first?
1, 13, Fry, I 'unno. Try it on me.  Ow! My sperm!
1, 13, Bender, Wow, neat! Mind if I try that again?
1, 13, Fry, Huh, didn't hurt that time.
1, 13, Bender, Whoa, mama! Hold still, sexy lady.
1, 13, Fry, What's wrong?
1, 13, Bender, That's no lady!
1, 13, "Fembot", Damn Chico! One more upgrade and I'll be more lady than you can handle! Why you so stupid, stupid?
1, 13, Bender, Hey, bite my shiny metal ass!
1, 13, "Fembot", You couldn't afford it, honey.
1, 13, Fry, All this prolonged exposure to radiation is making me thirsty.  Ah, if only there was some way of knowing which can had the winning bottle-cap inside.
1, 13, Bender, Huh, w-what? I didn't hear you. I was too busy using this F-ray to look inside of things.
1, 13, Fry, Wait a second. I'm getting an idea. N-No, false alarm. No. Yeah. No. Yeah. No. Wait. No. Yeah. Yeah. No ... no. Yes!
1, 13, Bender, Ah, this thing stinks.
1, 13, Fry, We checked 90,000 cans of Slurm and all we won was this junk.  I never wanna see another can of Slurm again. Man, am I thirsty.
1, 13, Leela, Fry, are you alright?
1, 13, Bender, You did it, Fry! You found the winning bottle-cap! We won!
1, 13, Fry, Hooray!
1, 13, Leela, Ooh, look at that!
1, 13, Bender, Hey!
1, 13, Glurmo, Welcome to the planet Wormulon. I'm Glurmo, your golly-rific guide to the splend-tacular Slurm factory.
1, 13, Fry, Uh-huh. Can we have our free Slurm now?
1, 13, Glurmo, You'll have all the Slurm you can drink later on when you're partying with my good friend, Slurms MacKenzie.
1, 13, Slurms, Alright! Whimmy-wham-wham-wazzle! Lay some skin on me, dudes!
1, 13, Bender, Wow! The original party worm!  Are you ready to get down, get funky with us?
1, 13, Glurmo, He'd better be, that's what we pay him for. Right, Slurms?
1, 13, Slurms, Right!
1, 13, Glurmo, In fact, Slurms has to party all night, every night, or he's fired!
1, 13, Slurms, Rock on!
1, 13, Glurmo, But before the party, you're all in for a fun-derful treat
1, 13, Slurms, Enjoy the tour, dudes!  I'm gonna go lie down.
1, 13, Glurmo, Welcome, my friends, to the wondrous world of whimsy that we like to call Slurms Centralised Industrial Fabrication Unit.
1, 13, Farnsworth, Oh, my!
1, 13, Bender, Look! Flowers! And a boat!
1, 13, Farnsworth, Who are those horrible orange creatures over there?
1, 13, Glurmo, Why, those are the Grunka Lunkas. They work here in the Slurm factory.
1, 13, Farnsworth, Tell them I hate them.
1, 13, Glurmo, As we sail down the river of Slurm you'll see our mix-ologists at work.  They take 900 of the finest ingredients, add a touch of child-like delight and mix it all with glacial spring water from our glacial spring water generator.  Then, last of all, we add the secret ingredient that makes Slurm so deliciously addictive.
1, 13, Fry, So, what's the secret ingredient?
1, 13, Glurmo, It's whatever your imagination wants it to be.
1, 13, Fry, Oh. But what is it really?
1, 13, Glurmo, That's not for you to know.  Now, over here the Grunka Lunkas are inducing Wumpus berries to release their flavour, using sensual massage.
1, 13, Bender, Psst, those berries. Those are the secret ingredient, right?
1, 13, Glurmo, No.
1, 13, Bender, You positive?
1, 13, Glurmo, Yes.
1, 13, Bender, I'm just asking cause they look kind of secret.
1, 13, Glurmo, Enough! There will be no further questions.
1, 13, Fry, Why?
1, 13, Leela, Hey, look! The disgusting little men are starting to sing.
1, 13, Grunka Lunkas, Grunka Lunka dunkity-do,We've got a friendly warning for you,Grunka Lunka dunkity-dasis,The secret of Slurm's on a need-to-know basis.
1, 13, Grunka Lunka #1, Asking questions in school is a great way to learn.
1, 13, Grunka Lunka #2, If you try that stuff here you might get your legs broke.
1, 13, Grunka Lunka #1, We once found a dead guy face down in the Slurm.
1, 13, Grunka Lunka #2, It could easily happen again to you folks.
1, 13, Grunka Lunkas, So keep you head down,And keep your mouth shut,Grunka Lunka lunka dunkity dot!
1, 13, Glurmo, Hey, I don't pay you to sing! You just used up today's bathroom break!
1, 13, Grunka Lunka #2, Hard ass.
1, 13, Glurmo, I heard that!
1, 13, Glurmo, Now, on your right, you'll see the Slurm Master checking the Slurm for colour and bouquet.
1, 13, Fry, So thirsty.
1, 13, Glurmo, Then he tastes it. He tastes it and tastes it, then tastes it some more.
1, 13, Fry, Uh, could I have some Slurm, please?
1, 13, Glurmo, No food or drink allowed on the tour. You'll have to wait until you're partying with Slurms MacKenzie.
1, 13, Fry, When will that be?
1, 13, Glurmo, Soon enough.
1, 13, Fry, That's not soon enough.
1, 13, Leela, Hey, what's behind that door?
1, 13, Glurmo, Nothing.
1, 13, Leela, Is it the secret ingredient?
1, 13, Grunka Lunkas, Grunka Lunka dunkity dingredient,You should not ask about the secret ingredient.
1, 13, Bender, OK, OK, we get the point.
1, 13, Leela, I was just curious because of the armed guards.
1, 13, Grunka Lunkas, Grunka Lunka dunkity darmed guards--
1, 13, Bender, Shut the hell up!
1, 13, Hermes, So you're telling me I could fire my whole staff and hire Grunka Lunkas at half the cost?
1, 13, Glurmo, That's right. They think they have a good union but they don't.  They're basically slaves.
1, 13, Leela, What are you doing?
1, 13, Fry, I'm dying of thirst. Grab my feet and dunk my head in so I can drink.
1, 13, Leela, No. That's moronic.
1, 13, Fry, Fine. I'll let go and swim around in the Slurm and drink as much as I want.  Help! I can't swim!
1, 13, Leela, Bender, why did you jump in?
1, 13, Bender, Everybody was doing it. I just wanted to be popular.
1, 13, Bender, Ow!
1, 13, Leela, Where are we?
1, 13, Bender, And why is the Slurm pouring into this sewer?
1, 13, Fry, This isn't Slurm at all!
1, 13, Leela, Something's rotten on the planet Wormulon. Look at this.
1, 13, Leela, This all must have something to do with the secret ingredient.
1, 13, Fry, My God. What if the secret ingredient ... is people?
1, 13, Leela, No. There's already a soda like that
1, 13, Fry, Oh. How is it?
1, 13, Leela, It varies from person to person.
1, 13, Farnsworth, Ooh!
1, 13, Zoidberg, Do you have any that aren't so tight around the thorax?
1, 13, Glurmo, Yes, over in-- Say, weren't there more people in your group at the start of the tour?
1, 13, Amy, Hey, yeah. Fry, Leela and Bender are missing.
1, 13, Glurmo, If you'll excuse me.
1, 13, Leela, Quick.
1, 13, Fry, Look! Slurm! Finally!  Oh, yeah! I'm never going 12 minutes without a Slurm again.
1, 13, Leela, It's the end of the line. This must be where they put in the secret ingredient.
1, 13, Fry, Well, whatever it is, it's even better fresh.  Mmm, still warm.
1, 13, Fry, Ew!
1, 13, Leela, Blech!
1, 13, Bender, Oh, Lordy!
1, 13, Leela, Fry!  Fry!
1, 13, Fry, That's the secret ingredient of Slurm?
1, 13, Leela, That's the only ingredient of Slurm.
1, 13, Fry, Ew!
1, 13, Bender, I'll save us!  Oh, that feels good!
1, 13, Fry, Thanks, Bender!
1, 13, Leela, The exit! We made it.
1, 13, Bender, Uh, Your Majesty, I brought the prisoners.
1, 13, Glurmo, Well, my curious friends, you learned the secret of Slurm. That concludes the portion of the tour where you stay alive.
1, 13, Leela, You wish, you slimy worm! Hi-yah!
1, 13, Slurm Queen, Good work, Glurmo. You have pleased your queen.
1, 13, Small Glurmo #2, Thank you, Your Majesty.
1, 13, Small Glurmo #1, Thanks, ma'am.
1, 13, Leela, How can you trick people into drinking something that comes out of your behind? It's disgusting.
1, 13, Slurm Queen, Is it? Honey comes from a bee's behind. Milk comes from a cow's behind. And have you ever used toothpaste?
1, 13, Fry, Whose behind does that come from?
1, 13, Slurm Queen, You don't wanna know.
1, 13, Bender, Look, we just came to party with Slurms MacKenzie. By the way, when is that scheduled?
1, 13, Slurm Queen, Never!  To the torture cave!
1, 13, Slurm Queen, You, my metal friend, will have the honour of becoming 174 Slurm cans.
1, 13, Bender, Ah, this trip is turning into a big letdown.
1, 13, Slurm Queen, As for you, you will be submerged in Royal Slurm which, in a matter of minutes, will transform you into a Slurm Queen like myself.
1, 13, Small Glurmo #1, But, Your Highness, she's a commoner. Her Slurm will taste foul.
1, 13, Slurm Queen, Yes! Which is why we'll market it as New Slurm. Then, when everyone hates it, we'll bring back Slurm Classic, and make billions!
1, 13, Fry, What about me?
1, 13, Slurm Queen, You are free to go.
1, 13, Fry, Yes!
1, 13, Slurm Queen, If you can resist this concentrated super Slurm!  It's so delicious, you'll eat until you explode! Oh, which reminds me, put a tarp over that sofa, will you? Bon appétit!
1, 13, Fry, Mmm!
1, 13, Slurm Queen, Farewell! Oh, and congratulations again on winning the contest.
1, 13, Leela, Fry, untie us, quick!
1, 13, Fry, Here I come.  Let me just-- One more taste.
1, 13, Leela, You pig. Stop stuffing your craw and save us.
1, 13, Bender, I can't see what's happening. Are we boned?
1, 13, Leela, Yeah, we're boned.
1, 13, Fry, I can't stop eating this delicious ooze. But I'm not gonna let you die.
1, 13, Leela, Hurry!
1, 13, Bender, What's happening?  Just in time!
1, 13, Fry, Nooo!   I could fit if I didn't have these damn arms!
1, 13, Leela, We're close to the exit. I can smell those filthy orange guys.
1, 13, Slurms, Stop right there!
1, 13, Bender, Slurms MacKenzie?
1, 13, Slurms, Shh! I want you to take me with you.
1, 13, Fry, Say what?
1, 13, Slurms, I'm partied out. All I want is to stay home and rent videos and watch them with a few friends. Is that so much to ask?
1, 13, Bender, Forget it, pal.  It says on this bottle-cap you have to party with us.
1, 13, Slurms, Alright, when we get to Earth. But please don't invite too many people, I wanna keep it small.
1, 13, Bender, No can do, Slurms!
1, 13, Slurms, This way!
1, 13, Leela, She's gaining on us.
1, 13, Slurms, Go on without me, I'll hold her off.
1, 13, Fry, But she'll crush you like a worm ... crushing a smaller worm.
1, 13, Slurms, It's alright. I'm so tired of partying. So very tired.  I'll save you the only way I know how
1, 13, Dixie, Yes, Mr. MacKenzie?
1, 13, Slurms, You've served me well these 40 years, but this time I've got to party alone.
1, 13, Trixie, But--
1, 13, Slurms, There'll be other parties for you. Now go. Go!
1, 13, Bender, Party on, Slurms!
1, 13, Slurms, Party on, contest winners. Party on.
1, 13, Slurm Queen, No! We're ruined! They know our disgusting secret!
1, 13, Farnsworth, Commissioner, my crew has made a horrific discovery
1, 13, Commissioner, Hmm, hiney, you say? Why, with your testimony we'll finally be able to outlaw this insidious Slurm.
1, 13, Fry, Outlaw Slurm?  Uh, don't pay any attention to him, sir...
1, 13, Fry, Grandpa's making up crazy stories again.
1, 13, Farnsworth, I'm not your grandpa, you're my uncle! From the year 2000!
1, 13, Commissioner, OK, grandpa, we'll take care of the bad worms, don't you worry.
1, 13, Fry, Ah, I just wish Slurms MacKenzie were here to enjoy this with me.
1, 13, Bender, Yeah, that Slurms sure loved to party. Whattya say we all party one last time for him?
1, 13, Leela, For Slurms!
1, 13, Amy, For Slurms!
1, 13, Bender, For Slurms!
1, 13, Farnsworth, For Slurms!
1, 13, Fry, For Slurms!
1, 13, Zoidberg, Whammy-wazzle!
1, 13, Bender, Hey, that's not that bad.
1, 13, Fry, Mmm!
