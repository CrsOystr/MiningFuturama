4, 55, "Amy", "Shman! The Great Rad Spot is mega-sweet for party-boarding."
4, 55, "Farnsworth", "Indeed."
4, 55, "Amy", "Any calls while I was out?"
4, 55, "Leela", "Yeah. You got a tele-sonic transmission from Kif a couple hours ago."
4, 55, "Amy", "My Kiffie called?  Kif?"
4, 55, "Kif", "Ooh, Amy, you're back. Another hour and I would have thought about hanging up."
4, 55, "Amy", "Why didn't you just leave a message, sweetie?"
4, 55, "Kif", "Well, um, I've left hundreds of messages with your answering machine but you never seem to get them."
4, 55, "Amy", "Bender!"
4, 55, "Bender", "Not my fault if you don't check me!  Messages erased."
4, 55, "Kif", "Oh, dearest, this long-distance relationship is too much to bear.  When even an inch separates us, I quiver with misery. So you can imagine how I feel when it's a billion light years."
4, 55, "Amy", "Kif, don't cry, or you'll get a tummy ache."
4, 55, "Zapp", "Lieutenant, some things came off me and clogged the drain, so if you could-- Oh, ho! What's this?"
4, 55, "Zapp", "Well, well, well! Do my eyes believe me or is that my bosom-y swan, Leela?"
4, 55, "Leela", "Say again. You're breaking up!"
4, 55, "Farnsworth", "Good news, everyone! You'll be delivering pain medicine to the hive mind of Nigel 7."
4, 55, "Scruffy", "Scruffy's rollin' out a large pill!"
4, 55, "Amy", "You're going to Nigel 7? Kif's on patrol near there. You could drop me off on the way."
4, 55, "Farnsworth", "We could but we won't! It's a spaceship, damnit, not a prom limousine!  If anyone needs me I'll be in the Angry Dome."
4, 55, "Leela", "This is a very long trip. So we'll all have to go into hibernative-naptosis to save oxygen."
4, 55, "Bender", "I don't even breathe oxygen!"
4, 55, "Amy", "Here I come, Kif!"
4, 55, "Zapp", "They jumped right out of their pants! [A klaxon goes off and the message ""Approaching Vessel"
4, 55, "Kif", "Yes, sir, captain!"
4, 55, "Zapp", "How 'bout I help you finish that dream you were having about me?"
4, 55, "Leela", "OK. I was just at this part"
4, 55, "Zapp", "Uh, let's try that a little lower and a lot softer!"
4, 55, "Kif", "Imagine you stowing away and stealing a licensed starship! Oh, it's so romantic it gives me the shivers!"
4, 55, "Amy", "I don't care how much trouble I get in. I needed to feel my lips pressed against your lipless beak."
4, 55, "Kif", "Oh, Amy, I can't stand having a whole universe between us. I've been thinking a lot about this and, well, would you move in with me?"
4, 55, "Amy", "Here? But, uh, wouldn't it be crowded?"
4, 55, "Kif", "No, no! It's really twice the size. You can use the floor and I'll have the ceiling. See?"
4, 55, "Amy", "Kif! You have so much creativity and niceness, but I'm not ...  ... sure if I--"
4, 55, "Kif", "Hush! Before you answer, come thither."
4, 55, "Kif", "This is the Holo-Shed. It can simulate anything you desire, and nothing can hurt you. Except when it malfunctions and the holograms become real."
4, 55, "Amy", "Well, that probably won't happen this time."
4, 55, "Kif", "I wanted to show you what life would be like if we were together. Computer"
4, 55, "Amy", "This is so beautiful!  Spirit! Kif, that's the pony I always wanted but my parents said I had too many ponies already."
4, 55, "Kif", "Yes, I programmed it in for you. 4 million lines of BASIC! And if this isn't the life you want, how 'bout this? Run program ""Kif 2""."
4, 55, "Amy", "Oh, Kif!"
4, 55, "Kif", "We could live here at the shore of the Tranquilibrius Sea in a timeshare. And I would pluck the moon from the sky just to see you smile.  Almost got it. It seems to be ... sort of ... stuck!  I love you!  Run program ""Kif"
4, 55, "Amy", "This isn't bad. My aunt had a place like this."
4, 55, "Kif", "Amy, we could live in a bus station bathroom for all I care. As long as we're together, it'll feel like a castle to me."
4, 55, "Amy", "Kif, I'd love to live with you ... someday. But before then there's still lots I wanna do on my own.  What was that?"
4, 55, "Kif", "Oh, dear. I fear the Holo-Shed might be broken again. Well, as long as we don't cross paths with Attila the--"
4, 55, "Amy", "Look! Spirit!"
4, 55, "Kif", "And there's Professor Moriarty, Jack the Ripper, Evil Lincoln!"
4, 55, "Moriarty", "Right-oh, gents, it's another simulation gone mad, so murder and mayhem, standard procedure!"
4, 55, "Jack the Ripper", "Rampage!"
4, 55, "Evil Lincoln", "Real holographic-simulated Evil Lincoln is back!"
4, 55, "Kif", "The Holo-Shed's on the fritz again! The characters turned real!"
4, 55, "Zapp", "Damn. The last time that happened I got slapped with three paternity suits.  Listen up, history's greatest villains...  Get back into the Holo-Shed before I start blasting!"
4, 55, "Attila the Hun", "Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!"
4, 55, "Zapp", "Spare me your space-age techno-babble, Attila the Hun!"
4, 55, "Bender", "Hey!"
4, 55, "Amy", "Kif! Hold on!"
4, 55, "Kif", "I totally want to!"
4, 55, "Leela", "Grab on!"
4, 55, "Fry", "Over here!"
4, 55, "Kif", "Please hold me!"
4, 55, "Bender", "Have a good one!  Oh, man!"
4, 55, "Zapp", "After all that I could use some relaxation. I'll be in the Holo-Shed."
4, 55, "McGee", "Well, except for a few broken bones, some internal haemorrhaging and a partially barfed-up heart, everyone appears fine.  Oh, and Kif is pregnant."
4, 55, "Kif", "Oh, joy!"
4, 55, "Kif", "Amy, isn't it wonderful? I'm pregnant!"
4, 55, "Amy", "Yes it's ... great. A great miracle."
4, 55, "Leela", "And not one of those bogus everyday miracles like a sunrise. Aren't you a male?"
4, 55, "Bender", "Yeah, what's the deal? Just when I thought I'd figured out you biological creatures, it's something else! Lemme at 'im!  Come over here, Kif! You--"
4, 55, "Zapp", "Look, I'm sure we're all a little unclear on how anyone gets pregnant. So, Kif, pray explain. And don't spare the dirty words where appropriate."
4, 55, "Kif", "Well, it's quite simple really. When one of my species experiences deep feelings of love we enter a so-called ""receptive state""."
4, 55, "Zapp", "You disgust me! Go on."
4, 55, "Kif", "At that point, our skin becomes a semi-permeable membrane, which allows the passage of genetic material. I held Amy's hand and voilà."
4, 55, "Bender", "Well, OK. But that better be all there is!"
4, 55, "Kif", "Oh, Amy! You'll be a mother!"
4, 55, "Kif", "What a wondrous affirmation of our love. And all from the touch of your hand."
4, 55, "Fry", "Dude, hold up. Remember when Zapp blew a hole in the ship?"
4, 55, "Evil Lincoln", "Indeed."
4, 55, "Fry", "Kif touched everybody there. Couldn't any one of us be the mother?"
4, 55, "Amy", "Hey, yeah! I mean ... what about that, Kif?"
4, 55, "Kif", "Well, I suppose I might have gotten pregnant that way. Or even from a toilet seat. Though that's impossible since I have a private washroom."
4, 55, "Zapp", "Ah, my home away from home. By the way, Kif, your flush seemed to be set on stun, not kill."
4, 55, "Amy", "Look, Kif, I probably am the mother. Although maybe I'm not. Of course, I hope I am. But just in case I'm not, maybe we should have a test."
4, 55, "Bender", "A test! I demand a test!"
4, 55, "Farnsworth", "Even I laughed at me when I built this alien cross-species genetic analyser. But I guess I showed myself! Subjects, please enter the chamber.  Now to take a DNA sample.  When I pull this switch, the maternifuge will spin at 10,000 RPM, separating out everyone who isn't the mother-- Father-- Whatever!"
4, 55, "Bender", "Faster! Faster!"
4, 55, "Farnsworth", "Good. Fry's ejection indicates that he is not the man-mom.  Nor is Captain Brannigan."
4, 55, "Kif", "Oh, thank you, merciful God!"
4, 55, "Farnsworth", "Zoidberg? What the hell were you doing in there?"
4, 55, "Zoidberg", "That's where I live. I have no home."
4, 55, "Kif", "Amy? But that means--"
4, 55, "Kif", "Leela must have impregnated me when she grabbed my ungloved hand. That explains the poster in hygiene class"
4, 55, "Leela", "Wow, this is all so confusing."
4, 55, "Zapp", "Leela! How could you? Our love has had to endure your constant hatred, and now this?  Stop testing our love!"
4, 55, "Kif", "Please, Captain. I thank Leela for the DNA she gave me but, in my species, the true parent is the one who inspired the initial feeling of love. We call that person the ""smizmar"". And my smizmar is Amy."
4, 55, "Zapp", "So the toilet seat is like the uncle or something?"
4, 55, "Leela", "Sorry I got your boyfriend pregnant."
4, 55, "Amy", "That's OK. At least Kif's baby shower should be fun. I'd better put it on my calendar.  Thursday"
4, 55, "Leela", "To motherhood."
4, 55, "Bender", "Zoidberg?"
4, 55, "Fry", "You know, my face was stuck in a pizza."
4, 55, "Amy", "Mom, Dad, I know this is weird but--"
4, 55, "Mrs. Wong", "Yeah, yeah. We don't care how squishy alien get pregnant. All we care is that we have grandchild now."
4, 55, "Kif", "You're very open-minded, Mrs. Wong."
4, 55, "Mr. Wong", "Hey! You call her ""Grandma"" now!"
4, 55, "Mrs. Wong", "Call me Grandma like crazy! All the time!"
4, 55, "Fry", "Check it out, y'all. Everyone we invited is here."
4, 55, "Zoidberg", "Also Zoidberg!"
4, 55, "Fry", "So let's open the gifts."
4, 55, "Bender", "Alright!"
4, 55, "Kif", "I can't wait! Let's start with this one, from Bender."
4, 55, "Bender", "It's my booties from when I was a kid."
4, 55, "Amy", "Uh, they're already bronzed."
4, 55, "Bender", "They are bronze."
4, 55, "Kif", "And this one's from Leela. Oh, I just love the bow! I wonder what it is!"
4, 55, "Zapp", "Yes, I wonder what we got you."
4, 55, "Kif", "It's a basket! F-For picnics?"
4, 55, "Leela", "It means a lot to me. It's the basket my parents left me in at the orphanarium."
4, 55, "Hermes", "You could use it for picnics."
4, 55, "Mrs. Wong", "Here, Amy. We get this one for you."
4, 55, "Amy", "Is it a new party board?"
4, 55, "Mrs. Wong", "It's a board alright! An ironing board."
4, 55, "Mr. Wong", "We had your old party board converted now that you not be partying anymore."
4, 55, "Amy", "You-You trashed my party board?"
4, 55, "Mrs. Wong", "Damn right! Now you're a mom, the only surfing you do is under a big wave of responsibility."
4, 55, "Kif", "Oh, this is the happiest moment of my life! You all brought such wonderful gifts. But the greatest gift--"
4, 55, "Bender", "Mine!"
4, 55, "Kif", "Is the bond I share with my smizmar, Amy. For soon, the quivering mass of life within me will depend on us both.  Even now, I can sense it feeding, squirming, searching, questing. And shortly, it will rend my loins in twain, burst forth and pull us down, down, down into the deep, dark waters of commitment."
4, 55, "Zoidberg", "That's so beautiful!"
4, 55, "Amy", "Yes, it's, it's--  No! I can't do this!"
4, 55, "Bender", "Oh, my God!"
4, 55, "Kif", "Oh, how could Amy leave me? When will women learn to take responsibility for the children they've helped create?  The quickening! My time is near. I must return to my homeworld to perform the ancient birthing rites."
4, 55, "Scruffy", "Lemme know how that turns out."
4, 55, "Kif", "I must now embark on a perilous journey to give birth in precisely the same swamp in which I was born."
4, 55, "Leela", "If it's so dangerous, I'd better go with you. A gal has to protect her DNA."
4, 55, "Kif", "No, Leela. Tradition demands that I make this journey with my smizmar. And since Amy isn't, here I must go it alone. Farewell, for we may never meet again."
4, 55, "Kif", "My scrapes feel a little better now."
4, 55, "Bender", "Hey, what's this fat ugly thing? A frog? A toad? Or your momma!"
4, 55, "Kif", "It's a poisonous froad! No one move."
4, 55, "Bender", "I'm back, baby!"
4, 55, "Kif", "Behold! The sacred ancestral birthing grounds of my family."
4, 55, "Zapp", "Smells like a jockstrap!"
4, 55, "Grand Midwife", "I am the Grand Midwife."
4, 55, "Fry", "Hi!"
4, 55, "Kif", "I am Kif, of the clan Kroker, come to bear my young."
4, 55, "Grand Midwife", "Then let the Tea of New Life be brewed.  As it is writ, ""and both shall lift the jug together"". Where is your smizmar?"
4, 55, "Kif", "She's not with me."
4, 55, "Grand Midwife", "Oh, the sorrow. Oh, the shame. I'm sorry, I'm probably just making you feel worse."
4, 55, "Kif", "As long as Amy is with me in my heart I will have the strength of two.  Apparently Amy hasn't been working out much lately."
4, 55, "Grand Midwife", "As the tea boils, please join hands with your beloved smizmar.  Oh, right, sorry. But I memorised the ceremony by rote and it mentions her a lot."
4, 55, "Kif", "I'll try to endure."
4, 55, "Grand Midwife", "Good, 'cause I'm not changing it. Now turn ye to and gaze deeply into each other's eyes."
4, 55, "Bender", "What are you looking at?"
4, 55, "Grand Midwife", "May the love I sense between you at this moment remain with you both through all your days.  The Tea of New Life is ready. Let those whose love created this life speak each other's names, then drink."
4, 55, "Kif", "Amy."
4, 55, "Amy", "Kif!"
4, 55, "Kif", "Amy! Is it you or have I gone crazy with loneliness?"
4, 55, "Bender", "Both."
4, 55, "Amy", "I still don't know if I'm ready for this but I do know I love you. And I wanna be here beside you."
4, 55, "Grand Midwife", "Great! Now I lost my place! I'm starting over!"
4, 55, "Kif", "Oh, no time! It has begun!  Oh, my!"
4, 55, "Bender", "Neat!"
4, 55, "Amy", "You can do it, Kif!"
4, 55, "Kif", "Whoa, Nellie!"
4, 55, "Bender", "Oh, man!"
4, 55, "Kif", "Amy, my love, tell me"
4, 55, "Leela", "Amy!"
4, 55, "Amy", "Shoo! Stay away from my babies!"
4, 55, "Grand Midwife", "The birthing is complete!"
4, 55, "Bender", "Alright!"
4, 55, "Kif", "Oh, thank goodness!"
4, 55, "Grand Midwife", "I will now take my leave. I live here so I won't actually be going anywhere, but you don't have to talk to me anymore."
4, 55, "Fry", "Congratulations!"
4, 55, "Zapp", "Nice work!"
4, 55, "Bender", "Way to go, squishy!"
4, 55, "Leela", "There goes my DNA. What a disgusting and beautiful process."
4, 55, "Fry", "That's birth for you."
4, 55, "Kif", "Well, we've given them a great start, Amy. And in 20 years they'll sprout legs and crawl back onto land as children."
4, 55, "Amy", "I'll be ready then."
4, 56, "Farnsworth", "Good news, everyone! You all know the orphanarium where Leela grew up?"
4, 56, "Fry", "Sure. We talk about it all the time."
4, 56, "Leela", "Really?"
4, 56, "Fry", "No. Burn!"
4, 56, "Farnsworth", "Well done, fellows! Anyway, said orphanarium has named Leela ""Orphan of the Year""."
4, 56, "Amy", "Yee-ha!"
4, 56, "Bender", "Alright!"
4, 56, "Amy", "Your parents must be so proud. Oops! Sorry."
4, 56, "Farnsworth", "And the good news keeps on coming. Behold my latest invention."
4, 56, "Bender", "Neat!"
4, 56, "Farnsworth", "Ta-da! It's a glow-in-the-dark nose you can wear over your regular non-glowing nose. Observe."
4, 56, "Amy", "Whoa, clool!"
4, 56, "Bender", "Now I can punch you in the nose in the dark."
4, 56, "Bender", "Where'd it go?"
4, 56, "Amy", "Hey, Professor, what's all this scloop, glorking out of the machine?"
4, 56, "Farnsworth", "That? It's, uh ... nothing. Yes, nothing. If you think it's anything, you're a suspicious moron."
4, 56, "Hermes", "It looks like toxic waste.  And it smells like toxic waste."
4, 56, "Fry", "What does it taste like?"
4, 56, "Hermes", "Delicious fig pudding! Ooh, that's good! But a distinct aftertaste of toxic waste."
4, 56, "Farnsworth", "Alright, alright, so the machine produces a few toxic by-products! You don't have to make a federal case out of it."
4, 56, "Hermes", "I'm afraid I do.  I order you dispose of that toxic waste properly or bribe me. Either way it'll cost $500."
4, 56, "Bender", "500 real dollars? That's an outrage! Professor, I'll take care of that waste for $499 and 100 cents."
4, 56, "Farnsworth", "Hmm, I know that's a rip but I'll pay for the convenience. Do you take credit cards?"
4, 56, "Bender", "Let's find out."
4, 56, "Bender", "Alright, environment, you've met your match!"
4, 56, "Smitty", "Hey, get back in the sewer, weird-y. No mutants on the surface."
4, 56, "Vyolet", "But he ruined my wedding dress."
4, 56, "Bender", "Honey, that thing was ruined the minute it went on you. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout."
4, 56, "Vogel", "Y'know, it's not easy being an orphan -- not if I have anything to do with it.  But today's honouree, Turanga Leela, has really made something of herself.  I'll never forget the night that cute little alien baby was abandoned on our doorstep. Because I have a photographic memory and I remember every night!"
4, 56, "Vogel", "What the--? An alien language? I guess you're an alien. What a beautiful gigantic eye you ha--  Well, come on in."
4, 56, "Vogel", "From those humble beginnings, Leela went on to become a county-certified starship captain. And so it is my pleasure today to nail her picture alongside those of our most distinguished alumni."
4, 56, "Leela", "Thank you very much. Like many of you, I never knew my parents..."
4, 56, "Vogel", "Give me a--"
4, 56, "Leela", "I don't know if they were mighty alien overlords or simply underpaid alien janitors who fought crime on the side--"
4, 56, "Vogel", "There we are. Picture's up."
4, 56, "Bender", "It's crooked!"
4, 56, "Leela", "In the end though, it doesn't matter who my parents were. All that matters is what I learned here, within these unscalable walls, that I have strength to make it on my own, just like all of you kids here today."
4, 56, "Kids", "Leela! Leela! Leela!"
4, 56, "Nina", "Look at me! I'm Leela!"
4, 56, "Albert", "Nuh-uh! 'Cause I'm double Leela!"
4, 56, "Vogel", "That's it, Albert, no more espresso for you."
4, 56, "Photographer", "Mind if I get a picture of you with your picture for the news, ma'am?"
4, 56, "Leela", "Yes! I mean no! Just make sure you get my nonchalant side!"
4, 56, "Fry", "If those aren't tears of happiness, please stop crying."
4, 56, "Leela", "It's OK, Fry. I'm fine. I won an award today."
4, 56, "Fry", "Is it this room that's making you sad? It's probably the room. Come on, let's go for a walk."
4, 56, "Leela", "I'm sorry you saw that, Fry. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness."
4, 56, "Fry", "Yeah, I do that with my stupidness."
4, 56, "Leela", "I told a whole crowd today that being an orphan made me strong. But all I really wanted was a mom and dad, to hold me and stroke my hair and tell me they loved me."
4, 56, "Fry", "Then today's your lucky day, because I happen to be a holding, stroking, lovin' machine! Also spankin'."
4, 56, "Leela", "That's not even close to what I had in mind."
4, 56, "Fry", "Well, anyway, just remember that people care about you."
4, 56, "Leela", "I know.  Sometimes, when I'm lonely, I look up at the sky and I get this feeling that somewhere, on some unknown planet, circling a distant star, my parents are up there, looking down on me."
4, 56, "Fry", "Yo, yo, Bezender! What up?"
4, 56, "Bender", "My dumping business is booming. I just got hired to clean up the set of Free Willy 3."
4, 56, "Leela", "Bender! Cut it out! First of all, the sewer mutants will be mad. Second, everything else that's horribly wrong with what you're doing!"
4, 56, "Bender", "Ah, those stupid mutants can't do anything. You seem to be forgetting one simple fact. Namely, I'm up here and they are safely down--"
4, 56, "Bender", "What did I do to deserve this?"
4, 56, "Dwayne", "Behold, our once beautiful mutagenic sewage lake."
4, 56, "Vyolet", "The radioactive waste you dumped in it has made it bright enough to see how ugly we really are."
4, 56, "Dwayne", "Oh, man!"
4, 56, "Raoul", "As if our lives weren't miserable enough already!"
4, 56, "Leg Mutant", "Tell me about it!"
4, 56, "Raoul", "Let the punishment commence!"
4, 56, "Leela", "Punishment?"
4, 56, "Fry", "No fair!"
4, 56, "Bender", "Bender's innocent!"
4, 56, "Raoul", "The instant you touch these mutatious waters, your DNA will be forever altered, turning you into horrible mutants like us. Especially him!  Allow me to demonstrate!"
4, 56, "Fry", "It's like that time I peeked in the kitchen at Imperial Hunan."
4, 56, "Raoul", "Submerge the prisoners."
4, 56, "Bender", "Wait. I don't even have DNA. Why am I screaming?"
4, 56, "Dwayne", "We're gonna beat you afterwards."
4, 56, "Mutants", "Mutate! Mutate! Mutate! ..."
4, 56, "Hooded Figure #1", "Turanga Leela!"
4, 56, "Leela", "Who said that? How do you know my real name?"
4, 56, "Bender", "Whee!"
4, 56, "Raoul", "What are you doing? Stop it!"
4, 56, "Fry", "What happened?"
4, 56, "Leela", "I don't know. I think I saved us somehow."
4, 56, "Raoul", "Go after them! The waters can't mutate us mutants!"
4, 56, "Raoul", "They went this way!"
4, 56, "Bender", "Quick! In there!"
4, 56, "Dwayne", "Kill! Kill! Kill!"
4, 56, "Leela", "Great Cheech's ghost!"
4, 56, "Bender", "What's this junk?"
4, 56, "Leela", "It looks like ... a timeline of my whole life."
4, 56, "Fry", "That's when we saved Earth from a giant asteroid of garbage."
4, 56, "Leela", "And here's when I dropped out and bummed around India for a while."
4, 56, "Bender", "And this is just last year at Space Mardi Gras."
4, 56, "Leela", "It's like some kind of weird Leela museum ... and I'm the Leela!"
4, 56, "Fry", "Dude! Over here!"
4, 56, "Leela", "It's all the best stuff I ever flushed down the toilet! Those are some of my diary pages. And my screenplay!"
4, 56, "Fry", "And also, for some reason, the letter I wrote you full of my personal feelings."
4, 56, "Leela", "Oh, I'm scared!  My whole life has just been a show for some perverted mutant!"
4, 56, "Vyolet", "They must be in here."
4, 56, "Raoul", "Yeah, after them."
4, 56, "Bender", "And then Bender ran!"
4, 56, "Fry", "Leela, freak out later. We're not done escaping yet!"
4, 56, "Dwayne", "Got you!"
4, 56, "Leg Mutant", "Take this!"
4, 56, "Fry", "Ow!"
4, 56, "Raoul", "This time I'm calling for the death penalty. And not just because I'm running for re-election as Supreme Mutant."
4, 56, "Mutants", "Four more years! Four more years!"
4, 56, "Raoul", "Oh, very well.  Your attention. Instead of being tortured to death, the prisoners shall hereby be expelled from the sewers and never allowed to return."
4, 56, "Bender", "Oh, cruel fate! Can we really never return to this dank pit of sewage?"
4, 56, "Leela", "Wait a minute. Why aren't you gonna kill us anymore?"
4, 56, "Bender", "Yeah! What are you chicken?"
4, 56, "Fry", "Shut up, you two! We can kill ourselves when we get home!"
4, 56, "Raoul", "They'll need transportation to the surface. Bring in the airship."
4, 56, "Bender", "Ew!"
4, 56, "Raoul", "We constructed it from the remnants of old discarded Macy's parade balloons. Underdog's groin, Bart Simpson's left ear and right shin, Garfield's owner Jon's forehead."
4, 56, "Mutant #1", "Fire up the sewer gas!"
4, 56, "Mutant #2", "Move it, you ugly normals!"
4, 56, "Bender", "Uh, I'm gettin' dizzy! I can't walk straight!"
4, 56, "Fry", "Come on, Leela. You can do it!"
4, 56, "Bender", "Hurry! We're missing our bus!"
4, 56, "Fry", "Whoa! What are you doing?"
4, 56, "Bender", "I'm gettin' on the bus!"
4, 56, "Leela", "Don't worry! I'll be fine!   They know something about me and I've got to find out what.  The lake didn't mutate me. What is going on here?"
4, 56, "Octopus", "It worked for me. I used to be a little blonde girl named Virginia."
4, 56, "Leela", "Eurgh!  Who the hell are you?"
4, 56, "Hooded Figure #1", "No one. And watch your language, young lady!"
4, 56, "Mutant #2", "Stop right there! I don't want to hurt you.  I didn't want you to hurt me either!"
4, 56, "Fry", "Leela's going nuts and I can't save her unless I learn more about her mysterious past. Isn't there anything else you can tell me?"
4, 56, "Vogel", "Nah. Nothing that wouldn't be a waste of your time."
4, 56, "Fry", "That's impossible because my time is worthless!"
4, 56, "Vogel", "Huh. Well then there is one thing.  It's the note I found with Leela the day she was abandoned. But it's written in Alienese, so no one on Earth can translate it. Not even Brainzilla."
4, 56, "Fry", "Hand it over."
4, 56, "Vogel", "Sure.  I just wish I could be more helpful. Would you like some dirt on any other orphans?"
4, 56, "Fry", "Look, I'm trying to save someone here. I'll have to come back for those later."
4, 56, "Fry", "Can you translate it?"
4, 56, "Farnsworth", "Of course. But only into Beta Crypt 3, a language so complex there's even less chance of understanding it."
4, 56, "Fry", "I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse. I asked you to get busy."
4, 56, "Farnsworth", "Very well."
4, 56, "Fry", "Isn't that the same machine that makes noses?"
4, 56, "Farnsworth", "It can do other things. Why shouldn't it?  Of course, even if it is possible to analyse the message, there's no way of knowing how long it would take. It could take an hour or it could take a hundred million years."
4, 56, "Fry", "Is it done?"
4, 56, "Farnsworth", "Certainly not. Two dings means it's done.  But not like that. Slightly more rapid."
4, 56, "Leela", "Where did they go?"
4, 56, "Bender", "Good news, Leela. I landed the contract to empty all the spittoons in Little Italy."
4, 56, "Leela", "Ew!"
4, 56, "Farnsworth", "That's it! It's done!  I can't believe it! My mind is boggling. The analysis of the note is printing out now."
4, 56, "Doctor", "It's a girl."
4, 56, "Mother", "My God! She's beautiful. No extra anythings."
4, 56, "Father", "Good people skills!"
4, 56, "Mother", "She's completely perfect!"
4, 56, "Doctor", "In my professional opinion as an ear, ear, ear, nose and throat doctor, she is the least-mutated mutant ever born."
4, 56, "Father", "And yet she's cursed to live the horrible degrading life of a mutant. Like all of us. Especially him!"
4, 56, "Leg Mutant", "It's true!"
4, 56, "Mother", "Maybe we can do better for her."
4, 56, "Father", "I made this bracelet so that in some small way we'll always be with you, even when it doesn't seem like it. During your entire life, for example."
4, 56, "Mother", "You won't pass for human, cutie. But if my PhD in exo-linguistics is worth diddly-poop, this note should convince them you're an alien.  And that'll be enough to give you a real life."
4, 56, "Father", "She'll never know we're her parents."
4, 56, "Mother", "That's our gift to her. Better we should die than have her learn the shameful truth of her origin."
4, 56, "Father", "I'm with you."
4, 56, "Vogel", "What a beautiful gigantic eye you ha--  Well, come on in."
4, 56, "Hooded Figure #1", "Keep quiet so she doesn't hear us."
4, 56, "Hooded Figure #2", "What's there to talk about?"
4, 56, "Hooded Figure #1", "Sh!"
4, 56, "Leela", "Hands up!  Tentacles too!"
4, 56, "Hooded Figure #1", "Don't say anything stupid, Morris."
4, 56, "Leela", "What is all this?  Am I a game to you? Or some kind of even more boring Truman Show? Do you believe I'm you Messiah? Your Mutant Dalai Lama? Stop me if I guess it!"
4, 56, "Hooded Figure #2", "Well, actually, there--"
4, 56, "Hooded Figure #1", "Morris! Sh!"
4, 56, "Leela", "And what about this  How did you get this bracelet? Did you steal it from me when I was a baby? Or from my parents? You robbed my parents, didn't you? I bet you sick mutants killed them. My parents were confused aliens lost on Earth and you killed them! Is that it? Admit it!"
4, 56, "Hooded Figure #2", "Yes. We killed them."
4, 56, "Hooded Figure #1", "You guessed the truth."
4, 56, "Leela", "Because of you I'll never know my parents. I'll kill you!"
4, 56, "Hooded Figure #1", "That would be best."
4, 56, "Fry", "Stop!  Thanks, Bender! Don't do it, Leela!"
4, 56, "Leela", "They killed my parents!"
4, 56, "Fry", "Close."
4, 56, "Leela", "They are my parents."
4, 56, "Munda", "Yes."
4, 56, "Fry", "I had the Professor analyse the Alienese letter that was found with you."
4, 56, "Leela", "What does it say?"
4, 56, "Fry", "I 'unno. But the analysis showed it was printed on recycled toilet paper. A squeezably soft paper used mainly in the sewers."
4, 56, "Munda", "It says, ""Your parents love you very much""."
4, 56, "Morris", "We still do."
4, 56, "Leela", "So, I'm not an alien? I'm a mutant."
4, 56, "Morris", "We never wanted you to know. You deserved a better life."
4, 56, "Munda", "You must despise us."
4, 56, "Leela", "You're my parents. All I've ever wanted is to know you.  This is the happiest moment of my life."
4, 56, "Bender", "Aw!"
4, 57, "Bender", "You are one narrow minded spaceship, Planet Express Ship."
4, 57, "Ship", "Whoa, whoa! Why should my tax money pay for art I find offensive?"
4, 57, "Bender", "Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?"
4, 57, "Ship", "Oh, it's filthy! Why not create a national endowment for strip clubs while we're at it?"
4, 57, "Bender", "Why not, indeed?"
4, 57, "Leela", "Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm gonna come back there and change your opinions manually."
4, 57, "Bender", "Fine! I'll be in my quarters appreciating controversial artworks."
4, 57, "Ship", "Oops! Sorry!"
4, 57, "Bender", "Ah, that Ship is so white bread!"
4, 57, "Hermes", "People, it's Valentine's Day next week, so your beloved company has gotten you all new uniforms."
4, 57, "Amy", "Clool!"
4, 57, "Zoidberg", "Clothing, delicious clothing!"
4, 57, "Farnsworth", "We'll need to look our best if we're to get the account of our new potential customer, Romanticorp."
4, 57, "Amy", "Romanticorp? Are they a corporation that makes romantic stuff?"
4, 57, "Hermes", "Very good, Amy!"
4, 57, "Farnsworth", "Everyone suit up. We're off to the most romantic city on Earth!"
4, 57, "Farnsworth", "Remember, we've got to show these people we're not bitter husks of human beings who long ago abandoned hope of finding love in this lifetime. Leela, you'll have to do some acting."
4, 57, "Leela", "Check!"
4, 57, "Sheldon", "Welcome. Oh, I'm just so excited!  I'm Sheldon, and this is my chief financial officer, Gwen."
4, 57, "Gwen", "For 30 years we've shared the adventure of managing Romanticorp."
4, 57, "Sheldon", "Not to mention the adventure of marriage."
4, 57, "Leela", "Oh, you have got to be kidding!  Ow! I-I mean, ""Aww! That's so sweet!""  Ow! I mean, ""Aww dat's show shweet!"""
4, 57, "Farnsworth", "You know, romance is an important part of our work too. Uh, right, everyone?"
4, 57, "Leela", "Yeah, sure."
4, 57, "Bender", "Oh, sure."
4, 57, "Sheldon", "Do any of you collect Lovey Bears?"
4, 57, "Amy", "I do! Kif's given me dozens. Is it true what the ad says? That you kiss them together out of blanket cloth and magic buttons?"
4, 57, "Gwen", "No."
4, 57, "Sheldon", "It's actually cheaper to genetically engineer real ones.  They frolic in the Lovey Forest until their first birthday. Then we choose the cuddly-uddliest ones and stuff them full of fire-retardant love fluff!"
4, 57, "Amy", "So cute!"
4, 57, "Gwen", "Knowing which pickup lines fizzle and which ones sizzle keeps us on the cutting edge of flirtation technology."
4, 57, "Frame #1", "Is heaven missing an angel? 'Cause you've got nice cans!"
4, 57, "Frame #2", "My two favourite things are commitment and changing myself."
4, 57, "Leela", "Does that dummy have a brother?"
4, 57, "Sheldon", "And now, friends and lovers, we come to the heart of our operation. Pun definitely intended!"
4, 57, "Hermes", "Impressive!"
4, 57, "Gwen", "My family has been making these hearts since the 1900s. Tastes may have changed but our secret recipe sure hasn't."
4, 57, "Fry", "Whoa! Letters like ""U"" and ""R"" can mean words like ""You"" and ""Are"". Here, Leela, ""U-R-2 Cute""."
4, 57, "Leela", "Perhaps. What's your point?"
4, 57, "Fry", "I've never been able to put into words how I feel about you. But somewhere among these trillions of hearts, those words must already exist. And I'm gonna find them."
4, 57, "Farnsworth", "So, do we have the contract?"
4, 57, "Farnsworth", "With that big new Romanticorp contract, I've been able to make those government-mandated upgrades you've all been suing me about."
4, 57, "Leela", "Ooh, look! You taped up the cracks in the dark matter reactor."
4, 57, "Fry", "And you got a cage for the lion!"
4, 57, "Bender", "Hey, who's been messing with the radio? This isn't alternative rock, it's college rock!"
4, 57, "Farnsworth", "Oh, it must have been the ship's new improved personality software I installed."
4, 57, "Ship", "Yeah, it was me. It's a cute song."
4, 57, "Bender", "Listen, Ship! No one changes my stations! I hope you have a good mechanic!"
4, 57, "Farnsworth", "It even comes with an adjustable voice."
4, 57, "Ship", "We each get one of the four buttons.  Remember, Bender? That was the deal."
4, 57, "Bender", "What? Did you just say--"
4, 57, "Ship", "If you don't like the stations you could just ... play with my buttons till you find something we both enjoy.  Oh, gosh! That came out all wrong!"
4, 57, "Bender", "Too late, baby, you said it! So, what'll it be? My place ... or you?"
4, 57, "Fry", "Before we deliver these hearts, I'm gonna find the one that sums up my feelings for you.  ""I Love You."" Hmm, too conventional. ""You're My Man."" Ooh, so close!"
4, 57, "Leela", "I'm not impressed by a guy's message, Fry, I'm impressed by the guy. Or not."
4, 57, "Fry", "Whoa!"
4, 57, "Leela", "What was that?"
4, 57, "Fry", "Maybe we hit a space cow."
4, 57, "Bender", "Coochie, coochie!"
4, 57, "Ship", "Stop it! You're mussing up my trajectory!"
4, 57, "Bender", "You know you love it, sugar-engine!"
4, 57, "Ship", "No!"
4, 57, "Leela", "Bender!  What's going on in here?  Planet Express Ship! Cover your shame."
4, 57, "Ship", "It's not what it looks like. Uh, Bender was just helping me ... zip up my turbine."
4, 57, "Fry", "Wow, Bender. Are you and the ship an item? I mean I know you're both items but-- How can you date a ship anyway? It'd be like me dating a really fat lady. And living inside her. And she'd be all like--"
4, 57, "Bender", "Fry, in order for me to get busy at maximum efficiency, I need a girl with a big 400-ton booty."
4, 57, "Leela", "Bender, dating your co-worker and primary mode of transportation is immoral, illogical and a violation of interstellar shipping statute 437-B."
4, 57, "Bender", "That's what makes it so nasty!"
4, 57, "Leela", "Still, given the chance, I'd give in to urges far more shocking."
4, 57, "Bender", ""
4, 57, "Bender", "I'm half crazy,All for the love of you,It won't be a stylish marriage,"
4, 57, "Bender", "I can't afford a carriage,"
4, 57, "Bender", "But you'll look sweet,Upon the seat,Of a bicycle built for two."
4, 57, "Bender", "Well, I'm sick of her."
4, 57, "Fry", "The ship? But you just started dating."
4, 57, "Bender", "With my mighty robot powers, I can get sick of things much quicker than you humans."
4, 57, "Leela", "Well just remember we all still have to work together. So try and let her down easy."
4, 57, "Bender", "In due time, Leela. But for now I'll just resume dating cheap floozies on the side."
4, 57, "Fry", "You have much to teach us."
4, 57, "Leela", "Doesn't it bother you even a little to be taking advantage of your girlfriend's trust?"
4, 57, "Bender", "Oh, wait, you're serious. Let me laugh even harder."
4, 57, "Fembot #1", "What's it like being a lawyer for the Mayor's office and also the world's strongest millionaire?"
4, 57, "Bender", "Well, baby, for starters you need to be honest all the time!"
4, 57, "Elzar", "Good evening, Bender. And to your lady friends may I say, ""Bam""!"
4, 57, "Fembot #2", "You know Elzar?"
4, 57, "Ship", "Hm."
4, 57, "Fry", "Huh?  Planet Express Ship? Is that you?"
4, 57, "Ship", "Oh. Hi, Fry. Is Bender home?"
4, 57, "Fry", "Uh, no. Um, I think he's at his parents'."
4, 57, "Ship", "Oh, I see. He didn't fly there in another spaceship did he?"
4, 57, "Fry", "Bender? No! He's an old-fashioned one-spaceship robot. Look, I'll tell him you stopped by, K?"
4, 57, "Ship", "OK.  Oh. Hi, Fry. Is he home now?"
4, 57, "Ship", "Of all the zoos we've been to today, I like this one the best. Bender, which is your favourite nocturnal rat?"
4, 57, "Bender", "Eh, they're all pretty unimpressive."
4, 57, "Ship", "Oh, honey, look! The tapirs!  It says here the babies lose their pyjama-like coat after their first year. Isn't that interesting, honey?"
4, 57, "Bender", "Yep. Mind-numbingly interesting. Ooh!"
4, 57, "Ship", "Bender! Are you looking at other women?"
4, 57, "Bender", "No, baby, never!"
4, 57, "Ship", "Bender, don't lie! I saw you at Elzar's with those two ladies of the evening. Explain that!"
4, 57, "Bender", "OK, I like a challenge.  No ... no.  Ah, I got it! I'm going to be completely honest with you, Planet Express Ship. Those women you saw me with ... were my accountants."
4, 57, "Ship", "Your accountants? Oh, I would dearly love to believe that were true. So I do."
4, 57, "Bender", "Phew!"
4, 57, "Ship", "I'm gonna go home and get dinner started."
4, 57, "Liu", "Who are you talking to?"
4, 57, "Bender", "No one, baby! Lucy Liu is the only girl for Bender."
4, 57, "Liu", "I love you--"
4, 57, "Leela", "Planet Express Ship, is something wrong?"
4, 57, "Ship", "Oh, it's Bender. He's acting so strange lately.  Do you think he's going to ask me to marry him?"
4, 57, "Leela", "Uh, no."
4, 57, "Ship", "Oh, somebody knows something she's not telling!"
4, 57, "Leela", "Look, I'm not saying Bender's not great but have you ever considered that maybe he's, y'know, not that great?"
4, 57, "Ship", "You're just jealous. No one loves you cause you're tiny and you're made of meat."
4, 57, "Leela", "Could you maybe pay a little more attention to these asteroids?"
4, 57, "Ship", "Sorry, Captain Leela. I guess I'm just having one of those manic Mondays!"
4, 57, "Lrrr", "This is ancient Earth's most foolish program. Why does Ross, the largest friend, not simply eat the other five?"
4, 57, "Nd-Nd", "Perhaps they are saving that for sweeps."
4, 57, "Guard", "Exalted leaders, the Earth messengers have arrived bearing a peace offering from their weak and fearful government."
4, 57, "Lrrr", "Oh, very well. This is a Joey-heavy episode anyway.  I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8."
4, 57, "Leela", "Esteemed potentates of Omicron Persei 8, please accept these 20 billion candy hearts as proof that Earth loves you this much!"
4, 57, "Lrrr", "These candies are choky and unpleasant!"
4, 57, "Nd-Nd", "And what is this emotion you humans call ""wuv""?"
4, 57, "Lrrr", "Surely it says ""love""?"
4, 57, "Nd-Nd", "No, ""wuv"". With an Earth ""W"". Behold!"
4, 57, "Lrrr", "This concept of ""wuv"" confuses and infuriates us!"
4, 57, "Fry", "Incoming torpedoes. Shields at maximum yarnell!"
4, 57, "Leela", "Steady, Planet Express Ship. Focus on diverting all power to the scramjets."
4, 57, "Bender", "Uh, look, Planet Express Ship, this might not be the best time, but, well, I really like you and whatever, but, I think we should just be friends."
4, 57, "Ship", "Nooo!"
4, 57, "Bender", "So we're cool?"
4, 57, "Leela", "Well, it was a spectacular battle but there doesn't seem to be any permanent damage."
4, 57, "Ship", "No damage? What about my feelings?"
4, 57, "Leela", "Aw, calm down. I'm sure Bender is taking this just as hard as you are."
4, 57, "Bender", "Bender is great, oh, Bender is great. Bender, Bender, Bender!"
4, 57, "Fry", "You could've have picked a better time to dump the ship, Bender!"
4, 57, "Bender", "Ah, the moment seemed right. Call me old-fashioned but I like a dump to be as memorable as it is devastating."
4, 57, "Leela", "I know. I know. Look, Ship, if there's one thing I learned from my mutual break-up with Sean that was totally mutual, it's that happiness can only come from within you."
4, 57, "Ship", "But Bender is within me! There must be some way to make him love me again."
4, 57, "Leela", "Trust me. You can't change men anymore than you can change the laws of time and space."
4, 57, "Ship", "That is so true.  I may not be able to change the laws of time and space, but I know something that can."
4, 57, "Leela", "Um, sweetie? You see that giant quasar we're heading into? You might wanna scooch a few parsecs to the left."
4, 57, "Ship", "I'm afraid I can't do that, Leela."
4, 57, "Fry", "What's happening? Space cow?"
4, 57, "Leela", "The ship's just taking the break-up a little hard.  She's nuts!"
4, 57, "Ship", "In a few moments, the power of 10 billion black holes will smush me and Bender together into a beautiful eternal quantum singularity."
4, 57, "Bender", "Uh, you don't need to kill us, Planet Express Ship ... because ... I love you. Oh, yeah, baby! I feel like doing stuff for you and stuff."
4, 57, "Ship", "Hmm. I don't believe you. If you really wanted to be with me, you'd merge your programming with mine."
4, 57, "Bender", "Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down! All my friends who've done that said that afterwards all the passion went out of their relationship."
4, 57, "Leela", "Look, I don't know if you want my opinion--"
4, 57, "Ship", "Leela, Bender and I really need to be alone, so I'm turning off the oxygen."
4, 57, "Leela", "Now look, missy! If you don't turn around now, I'm going to have to shut down your brain."
4, 57, "Ship", "Fire detected in the vicinity of Leela."
4, 57, "Fry", "Ha! That barely hurt Leela at all!"
4, 57, "Ship", "Maybe not. But what if the artificial gravity were to malfunction?"
4, 57, "Bender", "Float for your lives!"
4, 57, "Leela", "This is the one place she can't hear us. Everyone just pretend to shower."
4, 57, "Fry", "Same as everyday, got it."
4, 57, "Leela", "Now, here's the plan."
4, 57, "Ship", "Oh, if only I could read lips."
4, 57, "Leela", "Comprendez, Bender? You'll have to distract her. Merge your programming with hers while I shut down her brain."
4, 57, "Bender", "It's too risky. I'm a very meek individual. If her personality engulfs mine, the Bender you know and worship could disappear forever!"
4, 57, "Leela", "I'm willing to take that risk."
4, 57, "Bender", "Hey, pookums! Contrary to what I was saying earlier, melding minds with you would be extremely bearable."
4, 57, "Ship", "You really mean it?"
4, 57, "Bender", "Uh...  Yes!"
4, 57, "Bender", "Huh? Tubes? You're older than you said you were!"
4, 57, "Ship", "Come closer, Bender. Let's become one!"
4, 57, "Bender", "I prefer two. That way we can still be a horse for Hallowe'en!"
4, 57, "Leela", "OK, Bender has her distracted. Now I can shut down her brain by deactivating the carbonated logic matrix.  I can't concentrate with this obnoxious candy in my face."
4, 57, "Fry", "I'm on it. And maybe I'll find those magic words while I'm at it."
4, 57, "Leela", "Fat chance."
4, 57, "Fry", "Yeah, I know  Ooh! How 'bout this one?"
4, 57, "Leela", "Give it up, Fry! I've got to pop these tops in a precise order."
4, 57, "Leela", "Halfway there. The ship should be getting a bit less rational now."
4, 57, "Ship", "Want ... engulf ... Bender!"
4, 57, "Leela", "Only a few more.  Hey! I won free admission to Six Flags! Just one more reason we must survive this."
4, 57, "Fry", "Um, Leela?"
4, 57, "Leela", "Fry! I'll read your candy later, when we're not dead!  What was that?"
4, 57, "Fry", "Oh, nothing."
4, 57, "Ship", "We're gonna love being each other, you sexy ion!"
4, 57, "Bender", "Nooo!"
4, 57, "Leela", "Last one!"
4, 57, "Leela", "It worked! Gravity normal, air returning. Terror replaced by cautious optimism! We did it, Fry!  Fry?  You gave me your oxygen? Oh, no! Breathe, Fry! Breathe!   You leave me breathless.   Happy Valentine's Day, Fry."
4, 57, "Fry", "Happy Valentine's day."
4, 57, "Fry", "Bender! Are you OK?"
4, 57, "Bender", "Aw, what crazy thing am I going to date next?"
4, 57, "Leela", "Well at least it sounds like you were able to keep your consciousness separate from hers."
4, 57, "Bender", "Of course! Bender is a lone wolf. A solitary eagle.  A cuddly baby tapir!  And that's why I love him!"
4, 57, "Fry", "Well, I guess we'd better clean up these millions of hearts."
4, 57, "Leela", "Nah, I've got a lazier idea."
4, 57, "Zoidberg", "As the candy hearts poured into the fiery quasar, a wondrous thing happened, why not. They vaporised into a mystical love radiation that spread across the universe, destroying many, many planets, including two gangster planets and a cowboy world. But one planet was at exactly the right distance to see the romantic rays, but not be destroyed by them"
4, 58, "SewerCom Operator", "Your call is being  connected  by SewerCom. Reach out and touch the sewers."
4, 58, "Munda", "Look, Morris, it's Leela calling."
4, 58, "Leela", "Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. Ready for your big trip to the surface?"
4, 58, "Morris", "We're excited, honey, but we don't wanna embarrass you. I mean, your mother and I are basically monsters."
4, 58, "Leela", "Dad, relax. You are being so mutant!"
4, 58, "Munda", "I found this adorable little bag to wear over my head.  And it was on sale!"
4, 58, "Leela", "No one's wearing anything adorable over their head. Now listen, I could never, ever be ashamed of my parents. I'll see you this weekend."
4, 58, "Leela", "Hey, guess who I just got off the videophone with?"
4, 58, "Bender", "No."
4, 58, "Leela", "My parents! They're coming up from the sewers for a visit Sunday."
4, 58, "Amy", "Are you off your rocket? Your parents are mutants. It's illegal for them to come above ground 'cause they're inferior genetic scum. Uh, present company excluded, of course."
4, 58, "Leela", "I'm getting them a special one-day surface permit from Citihall."
4, 58, "Hermes", "Ooh. While you're there, could you pick me up a licence to kill?"
4, 58, "Leela", "Sure. Bare hands or weapon?"
4, 58, "Hermes", "Uh, what does piano wire count as?"
4, 58, "Farnsworth", "Good news, anyone. The Swedish robot from Pi-kea is here with the super collider I ordered."
4, 58, "πkea Robot", "Enjoy your affordable Swedish crap."
4, 58, "Fry", "Let's see what tools we'll need.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. Alright, we're all set."
4, 58, "Bender", "Nothing like the rustic wholesomeness of working with one's own hand."
4, 58, "Bender", "Ah, there. Finished. And with only six missing pieces!"
4, 58, "Fry", "Those Swedes sure know how to put in almost everything you need."
4, 58, "Leela", "Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with Mighty Thor."
4, 58, "Fry", "I feel like I was mauled by Jesus."
4, 58, "Zoidberg", "I've got just the thing"
4, 58, "Farnsworth", "Bad news, nobody. The super collider super-exploded. I need you to take it back and exchange it for a wobbly CD rack and some of those rancid meatballs."
4, 58, "Man #1", "Excuse me. hi! Do you have a minute? I live in Jersey City and my car broke down and I need to get back because my Aunt's real sick and she needs this medicine but I need money for the bus. So I'm mugging you. Hand over your wallets."
4, 58, "Leela", "I don't believe that story for a second."
4, 58, "Man #1", "It doesn't matter, I'm mugging you."
4, 58, "Fry", "There's no bus to Jersey City."
4, 58, "Man #1", "Give me your wallets now or my robot'll shoot."
4, 58, "Andrew", "Don't make me hurt you."
4, 58, "Fry", "I'm too scared to find my pocket. Here, I'll just take of my pants and give you those."
4, 58, "Man #1", "Hey! I don't like what I'm seeing. Give it to him, Andrew!  Give it to him again, Andrew!  What the-- Laser-proof shirts, huh? I'll show you."
4, 58, "Leela", "Huh? Hey! Quit it!  Hi-yah!"
4, 58, "Man #1", "Foiled. And after years of planning."
4, 58, "Andrew", "You're outta the game!"
4, 58, "Leela", "How did we manage to survive? What gave us those strange powers?"
4, 58, "Fry", "Maybe we're all wearing magic rings but they're invisible rings so we don't even realise it. Also, you can't feel the rings."
4, 58, "Leela", "Fry, shut up and look at this!  May cause superpowers in humans."
4, 58, "Fry", "Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub into your skin? You'd think it'd be something you have to freebase."
4, 58, "Leela", "Let's see. Which powers do we have? Super-strength?"
4, 58, "Fry", "Yup."
4, 58, "Leela", "Uh-huh. Lickety speed?"
4, 58, "Fry", "Check."
4, 58, "Leela", "Yes, sir!  Ability to command the loyalty of sea creatures?"
4, 58, "Fry", "Hey, Zoidberg, get in here!"
4, 58, "Zoidberg", "Screw you!"
4, 58, "Leela", "Ain't got that."
4, 58, "Fry", "Nope!"
4, 58, "Leela", "Wow. Superpowers! I'll be able to pack my day with twice as many humdrum activities."
4, 58, "Fry", "Leela, I think you're missing the big picture. When you were a kid, what was your biggest fantasy?"
4, 58, "Leela", "To have parents."
4, 58, "Fry", "Whatever. The correct answer is"
4, 58, "Leela", "Hmm. I have been looking for a way to serve the community that incorporates my violence. Let's do it!"
4, 58, "Fry", "You'll barely regret this!"
4, 58, "Bender", "Hey, a friend of mine said he mugged you today and you had superpowers."
4, 58, "Leela", "It's true. Thanks to this funky-fresh cream."
4, 58, "Fry", "Now me and Leela are forming an awesome crime-fighting duo."
4, 58, "Bender", "Wow! Crime-fighting. Cool. You say you're a duo? Yeah, duos are good. Of course sometimes they're a little short-handed.  See you. With two humans, you'd think there'd be a robot in there to balance things out but whatever.  I have these three costumes you could use. But I guess I'll just throw one away."
4, 58, "Leela", "We'd love to have you on the team, Bender. But aren't you more on the supply side of crime?"
4, 58, "Fry", "Plus the cream won't give you superpowers. You're a robot."
4, 58, "Bender", "So? I'm already super-strong. And my arms do this.  Also I got this going."
4, 58, "Leela", "Listen up, New New York"
4, 58, "Hattie", "Quiet! It's 4am and I just fell asleep for the first time in 30 years!"
4, 58, "Leela", "Sorry!  A new era of justice has begun."
4, 58, "Hattie", "What?"
4, 58, "Narrator", "Attention, all crooks, lowlifes and lawbreakers. Do yourselves a favour and crawl back into your filthy tenements, you human cockroaches. Or get your ugly face punched to custard by ... The New Justice Team."
4, 58, "Fry", "Captain Yesterday!"
4, 58, "Leela", "Clobberella!"
4, 58, "Bender", "And Superking! The best one of the three!"
4, 58, "Fry", "Wow!"
4, 58, "Song", "Go, go, go, New Justice Team,"
4, 58, "Song", "Go, team,Go, team,Team, team, team,"
4, 58, "Song", "Who's the newest Justice Team?The New Justice Team!"
4, 58, "Song", "Captain Yesterday is fast,Also he is from the past,Not just fast but from the past,"
4, 58, "Song", "Captain Yesterday!"
4, 58, "Song", "Superking has all the powers of a king,Plus all the powers of Superman,Also he's a robot,Ain't it cool?Superking, you rule!"
4, 58, "Song", "Clobberella beats you up,Clobberella beats you up,Who does she beat up?You!"
4, 58, "Song", "Clobberella!"
4, 58, "Song", "Citizens, never fear,Crazy do-good freaks are here,Until they run out of steam..."
4, 58, "Song", "Miracle cream,Miracle cream,Gives the power to the team,"
4, 58, "Song", "It's effects wear off for sure,So they just slop on some more,The New Justice Team!"
4, 58, "Bender", "Ta-da!"
4, 58, "Woman", "Captain Yesterday, I find your skintight high-waters incredibly sexy. Let's get together sometime."
4, 58, "Fry", "Sure. I'm listed in the phone book so once I reveal my real name to you along with my home address and a copy of my birth certificate--"
4, 58, "Leela", "Are you crazy? We have to keep our secret identities secret."
4, 58, "Fry", "From everybody?"
4, 58, "Leela", "Especially from everybody."
4, 58, "Fry", "Give several reasons why."
4, 58, "Leela", "For one, superheroes cause a lot of collateral damage, and we don't wanna get our butts sued."
4, 58, "Fry", "Or do we? No, I guess not."
4, 58, "Leela", "Also, if our identities get out, every crook in the city will be after us. Or, God forbid, our loved ones."
4, 58, "Bender", "Superking has no need for loved ones.  How ya doin', kid?"
4, 58, "Poopenmeyer", "There you go. Two one-day mutant surface passes."
4, 58, "Leela", "Thank you, Mayor Poopenmeyer."
4, 58, "Poopenmeyer", "Mayor here. What's that? Horrible crime in the works? Ruthless villain? Citizens in danger? That's fantastic news!  Because I get to summon the New Justice Team!"
4, 58, "Leela", "Sh!"
4, 58, "Poopenmeyer", "Uh, they're usually here by now."
4, 58, "Leela", "Well, so long. Keep in touch."
4, 58, "Poopenmeyer", "Wait, stay and meet the superheroes. There's three of you and three of them so it'll be perfect.  Is this clown on? Where are those daring crime stoppers?"
4, 58, "Leela", "Oh, I completely forgot. I left my apartment on fire!"
4, 58, "Bender", "Uh, as for me, I'm late for my LSAT's."
4, 58, "Fry", "And I can't take life anymore."
4, 58, "Poopenmeyer", "Clobberella! Captain Yesterday! My liege! You're just in time.  We've received a tip that the Museum of Natural History will be robbed tomorrow at exactly 9am. The target"
4, 58, "Fry", "Who's the perp?"
4, 58, "Poopenmeyer", "A dangerous villain known as The Zookeeper, who commits crimes aided by a pack of highly-trained animals."
4, 58, "Fry", "Pack of highly. Got it!"
4, 58, "Poopenmeyer", "His crew includes a badger with a troubled past and nothing left to lose, an elephant who never forgets -- to kill! And a seldom-used crab named Lucky, a.k.a. Citizen Snips."
4, 58, "Leela", "You can count on us, Mr. Mayor. Justice away!"
4, 58, "Bender", "Hold the elevator!"
4, 58, "Bender", "We're in here too."
4, 58, "Fry", "Uh, Leela, how you gonna meet your folks tomorrow? We've already scheduled the Zookeeper for a 9am foiling at the museum."
4, 58, "Leela", "Not a problem. I've cleverly arranged to meet my parents right there at the same museum at 10."
4, 58, "Bender", "9, 10 a big fat hen.  The name's Bender!"
4, 58, "Leela", "I can't believe the Zookeeper is this late for his own heist. It's just rude!  Total hell! It's 10! I'm supposed to meet my parents and I'm still in my secret costume!  There they are!"
4, 58, "Munda", "How could Leela not be here? Do you think she forgot?"
4, 58, "Morris", "Relax. I'm sure she's just ashamed of us."
4, 58, "Security Guard", "Yo! Freakjobs! Hit the nearest manhole, pronto, like."
4, 58, "Morris", "But we have passes that allow us to be up here. From the mayor himself."
4, 58, "Security Guard", "I dunno. I never heard of no mayor."
4, 58, "Randy", "The Zookeeper!"
4, 58, "Zookeeper", "Sorry I'm late. Long story. Now everybody hit the deck! I'm cutting the entire line and stealing the exhibit."
4, 58, "Leela", "You're not stealing anything! Nobody hit the deck!"
4, 58, "Zookeeper", "Ah, the superheroes. Or should I say superzeroes!"
4, 58, "Fry", "That was uncalled for."
4, 58, "Zookeeper", "Animals, attack."
4, 58, "Tour Guide", "Please do not feed the animals!"
4, 58, "Bender", "You're going down, my friend! Down Under!"
4, 58, "Roosevelt", "Man boxing a kangaroo is a peculiar spectacle. But a kangaroo boxing a robot? Now I'm afraid you've lost me.   Citizen Snips!"
4, 58, "Zookeeper", "Nice job, Fingers!"
4, 58, "Munda", "I'm scared and confused. I think we've wandered into an off-Broadway play."
4, 58, "Morris", "No, there are way too many people here."
4, 58, "Zookeeper", "Later, if anyone asks when I got away, tell them right now!"
4, 58, "Leela", "Forget it, Zookeeper! You're going into captivity."
4, 58, "Zookeeper", "Fool! A quip about putting me behind bars would have been far more delicious. Here, catch!"
4, 58, "Leela", "No, Fry! You can't fall fast enough!"
4, 58, "Bender", "I got it, I got it!  I don't got it!"
4, 58, "Roosevelt", "You've saved the Gemerald!"
4, 58, "Fry", "Yet the Zookeeper escaped, thus proving that the deadliest animal of all is the Zookeeper."
4, 58, "Bender", "You can get off me anytime."
4, 58, "Leela", "Oh, no! My parents are leaving. I've gotta go change back into street-Leela."
4, 58, "Photographer #1", "It's the New Justice Team!"
4, 58, "Photographer #2", "Can we get some photos?"
4, 58, "Poopenmeyer", "Thank you, mysterious heroes. The value of the Gemerald you saved is slightly greater than the cost of the damage you caused to this museum. A net gain for our great city!"
4, 58, "Munda", "It's good that Leela doesn't love us. She'll be less sad when we die."
4, 58, "Leela", "Mom? Dad? I showed up! And I got the audio tour for Treasures of Liberace's Tomb."
4, 58, "Morris", "Sweetie, it's OK. You don't have to apologise for standing us up on the only visit to the surface we'll ever have."
4, 58, "Leela", "I wanna tell you why I didn't show up, but I can't. Just please believe me that it was a very good reason. I'm sorry I disappointed you."
4, 58, "Munda", "Leela, you could never disappoint us."
4, 58, "Morris", "We're so proud of everything that you are, and we always will be. Because you're our baby girl."
4, 58, "Leela", "Oh, I can't take it! Mom, Dad, I'm Clobberella!"
4, 58, "Morris", "Galloping gators!"
4, 58, "Munda", "You're a superhero?  Well that's wonderful! But did you have to make the costume so revealing?"
4, 58, "Morris", "Look at me! Proud dad of a superhero! We should print up T-shirts. And F-shirts for our friends with two arms on the same side."
4, 58, "Leela", "No, listen. It's very important that you never, ever tell anyone under any circumstance."
4, 58, "Morris", "What if I've had a few?"
4, 58, "Leela", "Dad, you drink? No. Not even then."
4, 58, "Morris", "Alright. My sucker is sealed."
4, 58, "Leela", "In fact, I shouldn't even be wearing this around here.  It was brisk, I dressed in layers."
4, 58, "Munda", "That's my girl!"
4, 58, "Morris", "So, uh, anyway, my daughter's Clobberella."
4, 58, "Raoul", "Leela is Clobberella?"
4, 58, "Leg Mutant", "You're pulling me!"
4, 58, "Morris", "Sh. keep it under your sock. It's a big secret. That's why I'm only telling you two."
4, 58, "Big-Eared Mutant", "Oh, my God! That guy's daughter is Clobberella. But don't tell anyone."
4, 58, "Big-Mouthed Mutant", "Gotcha!"
4, 58, "Zookeeper", "Greetings, superheroes. Remember me?"
4, 58, "Farnsworth", "I don't remember much, buddy. And you're no looker!"
4, 58, "Leela", "Uh, Professor, isn't it time for your nap?"
4, 58, "Farnsworth", "Yes, damnit!"
4, 58, "Leela", "Zookeeper! How did you know our real identities?"
4, 58, "Zookeeper", "Let's just say a little bird told me."
4, 58, "Parrot", "Leela told her parents. Leela's parents blabbed."
4, 58, "Fry", "Leela, is the person that parrot is mimicking telling the truth by proxy?"
4, 58, "Leela", "Yes. My parents were so hurt, I couldn't help it! But I distinctly told them not to tell anyone."
4, 58, "Bender", "We are not amused."
4, 58, "Zookeeper", "And here's something you may or may not find interesting."
4, 58, "Leela", "Mom! Dad!"
4, 58, "Munda", "Leela, please forgive us! Especially your father who's the one who told. Thank you very much, Morris."
4, 58, "Leela", "Are you alright? Has he hurt you?"
4, 58, "Morris", "No but my allergies are going nuts.  Oh, God!"
4, 58, "Munda", "Every couch and table has animal fur all over it. He lets them climb on everything!"
4, 58, "Leela", "Alright, Zookeeper. What do you want?"
4, 58, "Zookeeper", "Why, the Quantum Gemerald of course! You must steal it for me before midnight or your parents will be devoured by piranhas that I have, shall I say, persuaded to walk on dry land."
4, 58, "Munda", "Save us, Leela! I mean, if you don't have anything better to do."
4, 58, "Leela", "We're out of options. We have to steal the Gemerald!"
4, 58, "Fry", "But, should superheroes commit a crime, even to save lives? I need moral guidance. Bender?"
4, 58, "Bender", "Hmm. The thought of stealing anything fills Superking with disgust. But if it must be so, then let a museum heist be pulled!"
4, 58, "Fry", "Oh, no! Our superpower cream is out of itself!"
4, 58, "Leela", "Check inside the cap. There might be a caked-in goldmine."
4, 58, "Fry", "El zilcho! I'm afraid we're boned."
4, 58, "Bender", "El zilcho? Is it too late to change my superhero name?"
4, 58, "Leela", "Just be cool. Nobody knows we're super-powerly challenged."
4, 58, "Fry", "Man, this costume is so damn heavy!"
4, 58, "7¹¹ Clerk", "Hey, Captain Yesterday? Can I, like, wail on you with this 2-by-4 and it doesn't hurt you?"
4, 58, "Fry", "Ow! That ... didn't hurt."
4, 58, "Security Guard", "Hi, superheroes. Everything OK?"
4, 58, "Leela", "Big O, little k, my friend! Just checking if everything's alright."
4, 58, "Security Guard", "It's OK, alright!"
4, 58, "Leela", "OK, then. Grab it!"
4, 58, "Tate", "Yo! The superheroes have turned evil! Most uncool."
4, 58, "Security Guard", "Get 'em!"
4, 58, "Leela", "Stay back! Or we'll, beat the tar out of you ... using superpowers!"
4, 58, "Fry", "So this is your lair?"
4, 58, "Zookeeper", "Of course not. You think I'd show you my lair? My lair's a million times nicer than this!"
4, 58, "Fry", "OK, take it easy!"
4, 58, "Bender", "Well, here's your lousy Gemerald."
4, 58, "Zookeeper", "Hawk! Fetch!"
4, 58, "Fry", "That seemed unnecessary."
4, 58, "Zookeeper", "Our transaction is complete. Come, Solomon. To the lair."
4, 58, "Leela", "Mom! Dad! Oh, I'm so sorry I got you kidnapped by a crazy madman who tried to feed you to piranhas."
4, 58, "Munda", "We're just happy to be involved in your life."
4, 58, "Leela", "No, no. It's my fault for telling you I was a superhero."
4, 58, "Morris", "That's true."
4, 58, "Leela", "I just couldn't stand to have you to think I was ashamed of you."
4, 58, "Munda", "That's sweet, honey. But it's natural for children to be a little ashamed of their parents."
4, 58, "Fry", "Oh, yeah!"
4, 58, "Morris", "Just like it's natural for parents to be a little disappointed in their children-- N-Not that we are."
4, 58, "Munda", "But you could call a little more often."
4, 58, "Leela", "OK."
4, 58, "Munda", "And would it kill you to use some mouthwash?"
4, 58, "Bender", "Hey, Fry, we've still got our costumes on. Wanna steal some more stuff?"
4, 58, "Fry", "I guess, as long as you think it's right."
4, 58, "Bender", "Superheroes away!"
4, 58, "Song", "Go, go, go, New Justice Team,Fighting justice is their quest,Superking, Clobberella, and all the rest,Here's to you, New Justice Team,Do the things that make your team,Help each other do some things,Winners don't use drugs,The New Justice Team!"
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!"
4, 59, "Fry", "There's no denying it, the future's crazy! Oh, well. Don't wanna stand out."
4, 59, "Fry and Zoidberg", "Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!"
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "There's nothing crazy about it. It's just Freedom Day!"
4, 59, "Farnsworth", "...an extremely dangerous mission..."
4, 59, "Fry", "So, what is Freedom Day? Sounds like some kind of feminine hygiene product."
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "No, it's a fabulous, crab-ulous day!"
4, 59, "Amy", "If you wanna do something, you do it, and to splick with the consequences!"
4, 59, "Bender", "You know, like how I live every day."
4, 59, "Hermes", "Happy Freedom Day! Ooh! I think my wrist is broken."
4, 59, "Farnsworth", "Of course, it wouldn't be Freedom Day without the traditional Freedom Tub!"
4, 59, "Hermes", "Mmm! That'll feel nice on my shattered bones!"
4, 59, "Fry", "Wow! Nude hot-tubbing? That's all I need to hear about Freedom Day!"
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "Then consider the following lecture a bonus"
4, 59, "Decapodian Woman", "Sure, you can be a comedian instead of a doctor -- if you want your parents to roll over in their graves!"
4, 59, "Decapodian Man", "Sure, you can vote for Shkinadel -- if you want there should be a recession!"
4, 59, "Decapodian Woman", "Sure, you can go to medical school -- if you've given up on your dream of being a comedian!"
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "That's why I love Earth! You can do what you want, and no one makes you feel guilty because no one cares."
4, 59, "Fry", "We're not listening!"
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "That's what I'm talking about!"
4, 59, "Stilt People", "Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!"
4, 59, "Bender", "Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train arriving on track one."
4, 59, "Woman", "Ow! You broke my foot!"
4, 59, "Bender", "Freedom!"
4, 59, "Morbo", "What's this next float, Linda?"
4, 59, "Linda", "Representing our men, women and children in uniform, it's Earth's greatest space hero, Zapp Brannigan!"
4, 59, "Zapp", "Happy Freedom Day, ladies!  Come on, let loose and show me something!  Anything. Seriously, I'd take an armpit.  Oh, yeah! Thank you, Linda!"
4, 59, "Linda", "You're welcome! OK, Morbo, now it's your turn."
4, 59, "Morbo", "If that is your Freedom Day wish."
4, 59, "Nixon", "Thank you, Secretary of Transportation. My fellow Earthicans, we enjoy so much freedom it's almost sickening. We're free to choose which hand our sex-monitoring chip is implanted in. And if we don't want to pay our taxes, why, we're free to spend a weekend with the Pain Monster."
4, 59, "Pain Monster", "See you April 15th, folks!"
4, 59, "Nixon", "Cue the fireworks guy!  Incidentally, tonight's Freedom Day celebration is brought to you by ...  ... ""Shankman's Rubbing Compound"".  When something needs rubbing, think ""Shankman""."
4, 59, "Bender", "Yay! Shankman!"
4, 59, "Hermes", "It costs a little more but it's worth it!"
4, 59, "Nixon", "Our planet has been through so much this past year"
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "I'm swelling with patriotic mucus!"
4, 59, "Nixon", "In our darkest hour we can stand erect, with proud, upthrust bosoms!"
4, 59, "Fry", "Anyone who laughs is a Communist!"
4, 59, "Nixon", "Knowing that, with a shifty glance skyward, we will see by the rocket's red glare that our flag is still there.  It's gone!"
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "Yes, fellow patriots, I ate your flag. And I did it with pride. For to express oneself with doing a thing is the very essence of Freedom Day! Bless this planet and all its wonderful people!"
4, 59, "Nixon", "Kill him! Kill the traitor!"
4, 59, "Man #1", "Hey, it's the guy who desecrated our flag!"
4, 59, "Nixon", "Stop that red menace!"
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "I'm all scuttled out!  Huh? My planet's embassy? They're paid to not kill me! A-yoop!"
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "I thought I understood this world. I thought I was fitting in. But I guess I don't belong on here anymore than I belong on our crappy home planet-- Ooh, sorry."
4, 59, "Decapodian Man", "What sorry? Our planet stinks, we all know it."
4, 59, "Ambassador Mervin", "Enough with the persecution, I'm saying. Zoidberg, as Ambassador, I promise you the full support of our government, already."
4, 59, "Decapodian Woman", "Poor boy. You want maybe a nice mug cocoa?"
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "Ambassador Mervin, you and your staff are so kind. I'm truly humbled.  What, no marshmallows?"
4, 59, "Nixon", "Let's storm the place ... without my prior knowledge."
4, 59, "Bender", "Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train, step aside. You too, fatso. Freedom!"
4, 59, "Leela", "Cool your jowls, Nixon. You may not like it that Dr. Zoidberg desecrated a flag. You might even find the image of it festering in his bowels somehow offensive. But the right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Earth Constitution."
4, 59, "Nixon", "Aroo! Maybe so. But I know a place where the Constitution doesn't mean squat."
4, 59, "Myrtle Fu", "The Supreme Court hereby accepts the case of Earth vs. Zoidberg."
4, 59, "Nixon", "Sock it to 'em!"
4, 59, "Crowd", "Two, four, six, eight,Eating the flag is bad."
4, 59, "Scout Leader", "Now your noose knot has exactly seven twists."
4, 59, "Man #2", "You can eat my dog. You can eat my truck.But you eat my flag and you're outta luck!She's a-wavin' proud around the world, from Dallas to Fort Worth.Let me say it again..."
4, 59, "Crowd", "Don't mess with Earth!"
4, 59, "Fry", "They sure hate Dr. Zoidberg."
4, 59, "Bender", "Pft. Posers! I was hating Zoidberg before it was cool."
4, 59, "Fry", "Where are we ever going to find a lawyer to take his case?"
4, 59, "Leela", "I'll ask the head of the ACLU -- once he's done singing."
4, 59, "Man #2", "Don't mess with Earth.  Kill Zoidberg! Goodnight!"
4, 59, "Old Man Waterfall", "Howdy there! I'm a lawyer and I'd like to help your friend out of his pickle."
4, 59, "Fry", "Who are you, old man?"
4, 59, "Old Man Waterfall", "Name's Old Man Waterfall but most folks just call me ""Old Man""."
4, 59, "Fry", "I'll never remember that."
4, 59, "Old Man Waterfall", "I'm a veteran of three dozen wars. Name a body part and a planet and I've taken a bullet in it, on it. All to keep our flag flying free."
4, 59, "Bender", "And you wanna defend Zoidberg? Are you familiar with the old robot saying ""does not compute""?"
4, 59, "Old Man Waterfall", "Son, to me a robot's just a garbage can with sparks comin' out it."
4, 59, "Bender", "The sparks keep me warm."
4, 59, "Old Man Waterfall", "I don't condone what Dr. Zoidberg did but I'll fight tooth and nail for his freedom to do it. Or I would if I hadn't lost my teeth and nails on Mars and Saturn respectively."
4, 59, "Fry", "Wait, you're a lawyer? You're hired!"
4, 59, "Fry", "You OK there in the embassy, Zoidberg?"
4, 59, "Holo-Zoidberg", "No. There's no cocoa marshmallows, and every night the rats eat a little more of my foot!"
4, 59, "Bailiff", "Oyez, oyez, oyez. All rise for the Honourable Chief Justice, Myrtle Fu, and the Associate Justices."
4, 59, "Myrtle Fu", "Counsel, you may address the court on behalf of Earth, if you're ready."
4, 59, "Hyper-Chicken", "I was hatched ready! Honourable judge heads, yonder crawdad done ate up our flag."
4, 59, "Holo-Zoidberg", "I was doing freedom of speech, Earth's most sacred right."
4, 59, "Hyper-Chicken", "Your Honour, freedom of speech applies to what comes out of a mouth, not what goes in."
4, 59, "O'Connor", "Can counsel cite precedent?"
4, 59, "Hyper-Chicken", "Uh, yes, darlin', I can. In State Of Alabama vs. Giant Space Iguana, chewin' the corners off the Constitution was deemed non-protected speech."
4, 59, "Souter", "He shut you up, O'Connor."
4, 59, "Myrtle Fu", "Mr. Waterfall, you may now present arguments on behalf of Dr. Zoidberg."
4, 59, "Holo-Zoidberg", "Oh, God, I'm nervous. Two of my three hearts are having attacks."
4, 59, "Bender", "Court's kinda fun when it's not my ass on the line! Nachos?"
4, 59, "Old Man Waterfall", "Oh, land-o-Goshen! Your Honours, I'm not some slick, big-city lawyer like my opponent here.  But I am a veteran who has fought for his planet. You see this hand of mine?"
4, 59, "Scalia", "Yes, I do."
4, 59, "Old Man Waterfall", "No, you don't  'Cause I lost my real hand plantin' the flag when we took back Halley's Comet! Yet it was worth it, so much do I love that flag.  I love it even more than I love my seven wives -- that's right, I'm a polygamist.  Yet I would gladly eat a flag myself, had I not used my intestine as a rope to hoist a flag made of my own skin, if it would protect the freedoms of the proud people who salute that flag.  Freedom such as polygamy.  I rest my case.  Whoa, jeez!"
4, 59, "Myrtle Fu", "The Justices and I will now confer using high-speed telepathy.  By a vote of six-to-three, we find that flag eating is not protected by the Constitution."
4, 59, "Bender", "Six-to-three? I beat the spread!"
4, 59, "Myrtle Fu", "The court orders an immediate public apology."
4, 59, "Holo-Zoidberg", "Apology accepted. Just don't let it happen again."
4, 59, "Hermes", "She means you, you turkey of the sea!"
4, 59, "Holo-Zoidberg", "Me? Apologise? Never! I came to this planet to learn the meaning of freedom, but I say it's you who should get a nice lesson! So do your worst because no punishment could be worse than denying my freedom."
4, 59, "Myrtle Fu", "You are hereby sentenced to death."
4, 59, "Holo-Zoidberg", "Wait, let me finish!"
4, 59, "Myrtle Fu", "Also, in a rare double-whammy decision, the court finds polygamy constitutional."
4, 59, "Old Man Waterfall", "I can't wait to tell my husband!"
4, 59, "Zapp", "Remember, men, take him alive so there's something left to kill."
4, 59, "Ambassador Mervin", "Stay back! This embassy is sovereign mud of the mud planet Decapod 10. Invading these mud premises is an act of war."
4, 59, "Zapp", "Yeah? Well what are you going to do about it, Shrimp-y?"
4, 59, "Ambassador Mervin", "You wanna see, Mr. Big-Shot?  Attack Earth.  Yes I know it's a schlep. Just do it!"
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "Aha! Now the rubber band's on the other claw!"
4, 59, "Zapp", "Ready ... retreat!"
4, 59, "Patron", "Shh!"
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "Deny my freedom, will you? Well we'll do to you what we did to the Squash Men of the Squash Planet! Squish them!"
4, 59, "Ambassador Mervin", "Charleston Chew?"
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "You bet!"
4, 59, "Zapp", "Alright, Kif, let's show these freaks what a bloated, runaway military budget can do. Bring me the activation codes for our global defence network."
4, 59, "Kif", "Aye, aye, sir."
4, 59, "Computer Voice", "Commence lip identification scan.  No tongue."
4, 59, "Zapp", "We can't be too careful with these codes. Rumour has it a double agent may be aboard this very ship.  I'm watching you! You, ensign, what's your name?"
4, 59, ""Ensign"", "Hugh Man, sir."
4, 59, "Zapp", "Hugh Man? Now that's a name I can trust. Run down to the central battle computer and enter these codes. Chop, chop!"
4, 59, "Kif", "Um, sir? There's something about that ensign that's--"
4, 59, "Zapp", "You're damn right there is! That strapping young lad's gunning for your job. And he just might get it."
4, 59, "Zapp", "The enemy approacheth! Lieutenant, fire missile one and recommend me for another medal. Make it gaudy, I'm going clubbing later.  Tick, tock!"
4, 59, "Kif", "Sir, all planetary defences have been disabled. Perhaps the Decapodians acquired our secret codes, somehow."
4, 59, "Zapp", "Well, Kif, stand by to take the blame. Steady, steady ... now!"
4, 59, "Leela", "Dr. Zoidberg, how can you claim to love freedom and then enslave all of Earth?"
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "Bah! Your planet doesn't deserve freedom until it learns what it is to not have freedom. It's a lesson, I say."
4, 59, "Fry", "Ow!"
4, 59, "Bender", "What the hell is this dirt pile we're building, anyhow?"
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "None of your beeswax, slave! You'll find out soon enough. Just focus on globing that mud.  Glob!"
4, 59, "Fry", "I'm no good at being a slave. I'm thinking about graduate school. Y'know, to become a barber?"
4, 59, "Leela", "This can't go on. Today is the day we fight back!"
4, 59, "Bender", "It's already 10 o'clock!"
4, 59, "Leela", "Oh, you're right. Tomorrow is the day we fight back."
4, 59, "Zapp", "Yeah? Well good luck, sister. All our modern technology is useless."
4, 59, "Bender", "I know I am."
4, 59, "Fry", "Hey, wait! I'm having one of those things. You know, a headache with pictures?"
4, 59, "Leela", "An idea?"
4, 59, "Fry", "Back in my day we didn't have your fancy all-digital weapons, but we still managed to kill each other just fine."
4, 59, "Bender", "Ah, the crossbow. A pitiless, elegant killing machine. The Bender of the 15th century."
4, 59, "Fry", "Not big enough. We need something that can take out an entire army. Something you could commit a war crime with--"
4, 59, "Bender", "Wow!  Ow!"
4, 59, "Ambassador Mervin", "Earth slaves, behold the fruit of your labours"
4, 59, "Bender", "Neat!"
4, 59, "Ambassador Mervin", "I don't need to tell you that occupation forces are expensive. But with the Mobile Oppression Palace, a few dignitaries can oppress your entire planet for pennies a day.  Warships, dismissed!"
4, 59, "Old Man Waterfall", "Do your worst, you sea devils! I'll make my stand with Ol' Freebie. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!  My spirit!"
4, 59, "Frieda Waterfall", "Great Grandpa, no!  Another victim of the mano-centric male-ocracy."
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "Ambassador Mervin, you killed my lawyer."
4, 59, "Ambassador Mervin", "You're welcome."
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "He defended my freedom when no one else would. He was a good and honourable man."
4, 59, "Old Man Waterfall", "I request a Satanic funeral."
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "Is it possible that all this slavery and oppression is shmutzing up our freedom lesson?"
4, 59, "Ambassador Mervin", "Ah, take a pill, Zoidberg.  Begin again with the crushing!"
4, 59, "Fry", "You haven't won yet, Mervin! You didn't expect us to even go to a museum, much less steal this ancient heat-seeking missile."
4, 59, "Ambassador Mervin", "I don't even know you."
4, 59, "Decapodian Woman", "Oh, it's gonna make such a mess!"
4, 59, "Ambassador Mervin", "This is your secret plan? Meh! Heat-seeking missiles are useless against the Mobile Oppression Palace. All Decapodian technology is cold-blooded, like us!"
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "All eyes on Zoidberg!  Ew!"
4, 59, "Bender", "Hey, I need that to smoke!"
4, 59, "Fry", "Zoidberg, how could you? I used to think you were cool."
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "Wait! People of Earth, listen. Yes, I'm desecrating a flag. But to preserve the freedom it represents!"
4, 59, "Leela", "Zoidberg, you set us free! I feel like I could stand to hug you! I can't, but you know what I'm trying to say."
4, 59, "Crowd", "Zoidberg! Zoidberg! Zoidberg!"
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "Ah, if only they appreciated freedom this much on my home planet. Wait a second! They do! Because this is my home planet."
4, 59, "Nixon", "And now, to raise this beautiful new flag, a red lobster that won't ruin your dinner, Dr. John Zoidberg!"
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "You're a nice man, Nixon."
4, 59, "Scoop Chang", "Dr. Zoidberg, how's about you take a bite of the flag for tomorrow's papers?"
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "Oh, I couldn't."
4, 59, "Nixon", "No, no, no, go ahead. You've earned it!"
4, 59, "Zoidberg", "Well, maybe just a taste.  Mmm! Now that's a grand, old flag!  I wonder what the Shroud of Turin tastes like."
4, 60, "John DiMaggio", "Wooo!  Two, three!"
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "Oh, my."
4, 60, "Bender", "Here we go, y'all!"
4, 60, "Zoidberg", "Zoidberg...Zoidberg...Z-Z-Z-Z-Zoidberg."
4, 60, "Bender", "This is a story about all my friends!"
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "Fry?"
4, 60, "Fry", "Unh!!"
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "Fry?"
4, 60, "Announcer", "Previously on All My Circuits..."
4, 60, "Antonio", "I'm sorry, Father. But, somewhere along the way, I forgot how to be your son."
4, 60, "Calculon", "Why, Antonio?"
4, 60, "Antonio", "Because ... I have amnesia!"
4, 60, "Monique", "Calculon? But I thought you were--"
4, 60, "Calculon", "Egyptian?"
4, 60, "Monique", "Before I kill you, I must ask you one question"
4, 60, "Calculon", "Let me get this straight"
4, 60, "Monique", "Not sure."
4, 60, "Human Friend", "I 'unno."
4, 60, "Cubert", "This show is awesome! When I grow up I'm gonna have so much amnesia!"
4, 60, "Dwight", "Me too. I mean, I have it now, but I forgot."
4, 60, "Cubert", "Well, mine's louder!"
4, 60, "Bender", "Cram a ham in it, you twerps!  Sorry!"
4, 60, "Fry", "Nah, I had it coming."
4, 60, "Calculon", "Welcome, swingers. Pull up a groove and get fabulous."
4, 60, "Monique", "Nude rocks bands, big piles of what I assume is talcum powder. It's quite a birthday party, Calculon."
4, 60, "Cubert", "Cool! I'm gonna have a fabulatious birthday party just like Calculon!"
4, 60, "Dwight", "Oh, yeah? Well I'm gonna show up looking good, just like Monique."
4, 60, "Leela", "Do you two have to imitate everything you see on TV?"
4, 60, "Cubert", "Um, we're 12. So, yes."
4, 60, "Dwight", "Hold up, Cubert. You're a clone of the Professor. Do clones even have birthdays?"
4, 60, "Cubert", "Um, duh!"
4, 60, "Dwight", """Duh"" what?"
4, 60, "Cubert", "Dad? Do I have a birthday?"
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "Hmm. You didn't have a birth so, technically, no.  Oh, don't feel bad. We can celebrate the day I extracted you from the cloning tank, or the day I scraped your DNA from that growth on my back."
4, 60, "Cubert", "Ooh! That one!"
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "Ah, yes. It was 13 years ago next week.  I used this very fork."
4, 60, "Hermes", "Aw, well isn't that-- Ew!"
4, 60, "Dwight", "Hey! Next week'll be my birthday too."
4, 60, "Hermes", "That's true. If only there were a way to have one party for both of you here at the office then write it off as a business expense. Wait! I thought of a way! The way I just said!"
4, 60, "Cubert", "Yeah!"
4, 60, "Dwight", "Way to go, Pops!"
4, 60, "Bender", "Something's happening on television."
4, 60, "Calculon", "Oh, Monique, why did we wait so many years to bathe in champagne?"
4, 60, "Antonio", "Father, I've discovered the shocking secret mother has kept from you for 200 years."
4, 60, "Monique", "No! No!"
4, 60, "Antonio", "Brace yourself. For when I speak these words, you may well suffer an attack of explosive amnesia. For you see, the horrible secret is--"
4, 60, "Bender", "Whoever's directing this is a master of suspense!"
4, 60, "Sal", "He's busteds. Let's get hims outta heres."
4, 60, "Announcer", "We now join America's most popular show already in progress, Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad."
4, 60, "Fry", "This show's been going downhill since season three."
4, 60, "Zoidberg", "Look who's here, everyone! It's Zoidberg, the lovable tramp!"
4, 60, "Leela", "Since when are you performing at children's parties?"
4, 60, "Zoidberg", "Performing? What? Please, if someone could spare me money to buy shoes--"
4, 60, "Dwight", "This party pukes."
4, 60, "Cubert", "Yeah! The guests were supposed to be here three hours ago."
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "Well, that doesn't mean that no one is coming or that you two are total losers. Who gave you that idea?"
4, 60, "Dwight", "Alright! They must have all come as a group."
4, 60, "Cubert", "Welcome, swingers! Pull up a groove and get fabulous."
4, 60, "Tinny Tim", "Good day, fellows. Someone dumped this invitation in my begging cup. Happy growth-scraping day to all!"
4, 60, "Hermes", "Fire 'em all."
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "Mm-hm. Mm-hm."
4, 60, "Bender", "Guys! Guys! Something's happening on television again."
4, 60, "Morbo", "Welcome to Entertainment And Earth Invasion Tonite. Across the galaxy, my people are completing the mighty space fleet that will exterminate the human race! But first, this news from Tinseltown."
4, 60, "Linda", "Following Antonio Calculon Jr.'s breakdown on the set, the popular TV show All My Circuits will hold an open casting call for child robots to replace him."
4, 60, "Bender", "An open casting call for child robots? Tinny Tim, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?"
4, 60, "Tinny Tim", "What's that, sir?"
4, 60, "Bender", "That I, Bender, am perfect for the role!"
4, 60, "Tinny Tim", "You raised my hopes and dashed them quite expertly, sir.  Bravo!"
4, 60, "Leela", "Bender, your swarthy Latin charm will only get you so far. There's a lot of famous child acting units here."
4, 60, "Fry", "Look! There's Macaulay Culkon."
4, 60, "Leela", "He's just not cute since he got puberty installed."
4, 60, "Fry", "Pst. There's that robot child actor who grew up and robbed a convenience store!"
4, 60, "Leela", "And there's that robot child actor who grew up and became a convenience store!"
4, 60, "Robber-bot", "Lottery ticket, please."
4, 60, "Casting Director", "We're ready for the first audition.   Emotitron Jr.?"
4, 60, "Mombot", "Hold on, precious. Let's make you look nice for the lady.  What's this?  What did I tell you?  No more hanging wires!"
4, 60, "Casting Director", "In this scene, you've just found out your real father is Calculon's fourth evil identical septuplet, Sleazy Martinez. OK ... take us there!"
4, 60, "Emotitron Jr.", "Now that I know the truth, Father, I must ride south and join the robo-bandidos at Veracruz."
4, 60, "Bender", "Awful! Boo! This kid sucks! We want Bender! Boo!"
4, 60, "Calculon", "Well, I thought he was good but the audience seems to have turned on him."
4, 60, "Casting Director", "But I don't think--"
4, 60, "Calculon", "Next!"
4, 60, "Macaulay Culkon", "--At Veracruz. So, if you'll kindly hand me my poncho--"
4, 60, "Bender", "Boo! Bring on Bender! Boo! Bender's the greatest!"
4, 60, "Calculon", "Sorry, kid. You're flailing up there.  90 actors and they all got boo-ed. I just wish we could get this Bender I keep hearing about. They say he's the greatest."
4, 60, "Casting Director", "Well, there is a robot named Bender here but he's much too old for--"
4, 60, "Calculon", "Send him in forthwith!"
4, 60, "Bender", "Boo! Not as good as Bender! Boo!"
4, 60, "Casting Director", "Mr. Bender?"
4, 60, "Casting Director", "Have you ever been on TV before?"
4, 60, "Bender", "Once, when I took those hostages."
4, 60, "Calculon", "I saw that! You were good. Let's hear you audition."
4, 60, "Bender", "Bandidos, eh? Aw, this is great! 'Cause I happen to have a flawless Spanish accent!   I will see. Adios Padre! Come, Jesus, my faithful ... chee-huey-hua. Tonight we eat ... gee-wack-a-mole by the El Rio!"
4, 60, "Calculon", "That was so terrible I think you gave me cancer! I don't care how popular you are. You will never work on my show!"
4, 60, "Fry", "Yay, Bender!"
4, 60, "Leela", "We demand Bender!"
4, 60, "Calculon", "However, you've got the job. Welcome aboard, son!"
4, 60, "Bender", "Father-o!"
4, 60, "Calculon", "Bender, I'd like you to meet our director ...  ... whose name I never learned."
4, 60, "Bender", "Yo! I read the script and I think it would help my character's motivation if he was on fire."
4, 60, "Director", "Uh, don't worry about the script, baby. We re-wrote your part to better suit your acting abilities."
4, 60, "Bender", "So now my character has a British accent?"
4, 60, "Director", "No, now your character's in a coma. Get in bed and don't move.  And ... action!"
4, 60, "Bender", "Stupid dumb coma ... coulda been British."
4, 60, "Calculon", "Alas that mine only son should sink into an irreversible, permanent ... coma."
4, 60, "Bender", "Permanent? That's completely out of character for Antonio. I'm gettin' up."
4, 60, "Calculon", "Curse the tragic wildebeest accident that--"
4, 60, "Bender", "Hey, everyone! Antonio here, but you can call me ""Bender""! I got ants in my butt and I needs to strut.  C'mon, baby!  Come on!"
4, 60, "Calculon", "I'm not familiar with the type of thing I'm seeing."
4, 60, "Bender", "Bite my shiny metal ass!  Ooh, yeah! C'mon, baby! Come on! Yeah!"
4, 60, "Director", "Cut!  That's the worst coma acting I've ever seen. We'll have to shoot it again."
4, 60, "Calculon", "No! No, no, no. I don't do two takes."
4, 60, "Director", "But this guy was--"
4, 60, "Calculon", "Amateurs like you do two takes. I do one take. Print it. I'll be in my three-storey trailer."
4, 60, "Bender", "Bite my shiny metal ass!  Ooh, yeah! C'mon, baby! Come on! Yeah!"
4, 60, "Bender", "Now that's hospital dancing.  Pretty good, eh, Calcky?"
4, 60, "Calculon", "Good? I've seen better acting from extras in Godzilla movies.  I don't even remember shooting this scene."
4, 60, "Director", "We didn't. That's security camera footage from your dressing room."
4, 60, "Calculon", "He stole the scene and my money? That's it! I demand you fire this felonious ham!"
4, 60, "Director", "The network Execubots are coming!"
4, 60, "Calculon", "Oh, dear God!"
4, 60, "Betabot", "Presenting the president of the network."
4, 60, "Network President", "Greetings, gentlemen. You already know my Execubots"
4, 60, "Alphabot", "Hey, hey, hey."
4, 60, "Network President", "Executive Beta, programmed to roll dice to determine the fall schedule."
4, 60, "Betabot", "More reality shows."
4, 60, "Network President", "And Executive Gamma, programmed to underestimate middle America."
4, 60, "Gammabot", "It's funny but is it going to get them off their tractors?"
4, 60, "Network President", "Now, who put this obnoxious, dancing robot on my network?"
4, 60, "Director", "We were about to fire him, sir."
4, 60, "Network President", "Silence, hack! We've been monitoring our Nielsen families carefully. And during the 12 seconds Bender was on screen, viewer eyeball focus was up 90%."
4, 60, "Calculon", "But, sir, children watch this show. Bender's no role model, he's a filth monger!"
4, 60, "Network President", "At our network, we love filth! Filthy rich, that is! Being filthy rich, that is!  ""Bite my shiny metal ass"" could be a catchphrase."
4, 60, "Alphabot", "80% likely."
4, 60, "Gammabot", "It will play in Peoria."
4, 60, "Betabot", "Gameshows are back."
4, 60, "Network President", "We need this edgy, sweeps-ready robot on our network. Bender? Can you continue to drink, smoke and steal things on TV?"
4, 60, "Bender", "Yes, I can."
4, 60, "Tinny Tim", "Yeah! Shooting!"
4, 60, "Dwight", "Alright!"
4, 60, "Dwight", "Yo! Check out what I jacked from my dad."
4, 60, "Cubert", "A cigar!"
4, 60, "Tinny Tim", "Ripping!"
4, 60, "Dwight", "Look! I'm Bender!"
4, 60, "Hermes", "Ras H. Tafari! What's goin' on here?"
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "The ruffians smoked one of your cigars."
4, 60, "Hermes", "That's not a cigar. Uh ... and it's not mine!"
4, 60, "Cubert", "Hey, Dad! Bite my shiny metal ass!"
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "What? Such an act would be most uncomfortable for both of us! Where did you learn such language?"
4, 60, "Tinny Tim", "From Bender, my good jerkwad."
4, 60, "Hermes", "Bender, eh? That guy's really startin' to twist my dreads."
4, 60, "Bender", "OK, OK, OK. Get ready for this part."
4, 60, "Zoidberg", "Quiet, robot! Bender's on TV."
4, 60, "Monique", "Oh, Calculon, it's so good to get away from the city and that beastly, yet intriguing, Bender."
4, 60, "Bender", "Try this, kids at home!"
4, 60, "Linda", "Is television sensation Bender a bad role model for Earth children?"
4, 60, "Bender", "That's crazy!"
4, 60, "Linda", "A new protest group, Fathers Against Rude Television, says ""Hell, yes!"""
4, 60, "Fry", "Pft! What kind of bozos would start a Bender protest group?"
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "Good news, everyone. Hermes and I have started a Bender protest group."
4, 60, "Zoidberg", "That was uncanny."
4, 60, "Hermes", "Fathers Against Rude Television don't want our kids watching Bender's high-definition filth."
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "And for what? Some kind of cheap laugh? That's not what F-A-R-T is all about."
4, 60, "Hermes", "No, sir! Not us FARTers."
4, 60, "Bender", "Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't censor me just 'cause I'm an obscenely bad role model."
4, 60, "Leela", "As unclean as it makes me feel, I agree with Bender. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV."
4, 60, "Fry", "Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools."
4, 60, "Cubert", "Our dads are all pumped up on dork-osterone. We're just trying to be cool, like Bender."
4, 60, "Dwight", "Yeah, and it's not even working. Smoking and drinking make us barf."
4, 60, "Tinny Tim", "Gentle jerkwads. I know how to emulate Bender without barfing. We could commit a burglary."
4, 60, "Dwight", "Hey, yeah!"
4, 60, "Cubert", "Bender loves to burgle!"
4, 60, "Dwight", "Hold up, though. Who could we rob? We don't even know anyone with cool stuff."
4, 60, "Cubert", "Duh! We know someone who runs on pure cool fuel"
4, 60, "Dwight", "Whoa!"
4, 60, "Tinny Tim", "We'll rob Bender!"
4, 60, "Dwight", "TV gave us the idea."
4, 60, "Bender", "You're watching Futurama, the show that does not advocate the cool crime of robbery."
4, 60, "Cubert", "OK. It's crime time."
4, 60, "Fry", "Hey, Bender.  Hey, Bender.  Hey, Bender.  Hey, Bender."
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "What's going on in here?  Oh. Now I'm really outraged."
4, 60, "Hermes", "Where did you requisition this party? And Zoidberg, what are you doing here?"
4, 60, "Zoidberg", "I'm networking. Let me give you my card."
4, 60, "Cubert", "Relax, Dad. We just invited a few friends over."
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "Hmm. There's something wrong with your story but I can't put my finger on it.  Of course! You don't have friends!"
4, 60, "Hermes", "Yeah. Why do these popular kids consider you cool all of a sudden?"
4, 60, "Dwight", "Um ... we're just cool, is all!"
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "Balderdash! I'll be the judge of who's cool, using the cool-o-meter!"
4, 60, "Cool-o-Meter", "Oh, yeah!"
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "Good Lord! I'm getting a reading of over 40 mega-Fonzies."
4, 60, "Hermes", "Everybody out!"
4, 60, "Zoidberg", "So, do you guys know about anything else going on, because I'm totally still ready to party."
4, 60, "Hermes", "There's enough cool stuff here to furnish a happenin' pad. Where did it all come from?"
4, 60, "Tinny Tim", "Don't tell, comrades. All for one and one for all!"
4, 60, "Dwight", "We stole it!"
4, 60, "Tinny Tim", "Oh, crumb!"
4, 60, "Bender", "What? What's going on?"
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "I'll tell you what. Our boys have taken up stealing! One of the worst and coolest of crimes."
4, 60, "Hermes", "And all from watching you on TV, you cool jerk."
4, 60, "Bender", "Hey, lay off me. TV would stink if everyone on it was a positive role model. Bender is about entertainment, baby! You can't hold me responsible for what kids do when-- Hey! This is my stuff they stole!  That's the last straw! Bender should not be allowed on television!"
4, 60, "Bender", "Bender must be stopped. I've gone too far. Who does that guy think I am?  Come on! We're gonna march all the way to Hollywood and make them stop forcing their filthy me down our throats!"
4, 60, "FART Mob", "Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender!"
4, 60, "Bender", "This mob's with me."
4, 60, "Security Guard", "Go ahead."
4, 60, "FART Mob", "Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with--  Bender! Down with Bender!"
4, 60, "Calculon", "As a doctor and captain of this hospital ship, I now pronounce you man and wife with six months to live."
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "Listen up, Hollywood. We're an exciting, new mob."
4, 60, "Bender", "Yeah!"
4, 60, "Hermes", "You'd better believe it!"
4, 60, "Calculon", "Great Shatner's ghost!"
4, 60, "Bender", "We demand that all TV's be equipped with a B-Chip that blocks Bender from appearing on the screen."
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "Booya!"
4, 60, "Network President", "I'm afraid the answer is a gritty, in-your-face no."
4, 60, "Bender", "Then I quit."
4, 60, "Network President", "Then you don't quit.  I think you'll be finishing the scene now, Mr. Bender. And don't skimp on the nasty."
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "There'll be no further nasty.  We still have the option of resorting to violence."
4, 60, "Hermes", "What makes you think that'll work?"
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "I saw it on TV in that episode where Bender shot Calculon. How cool was that?"
4, 60, "Bender", "Ooh, yeah! C'mon--"
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "Quit the show!"
4, 60, "Network President", "Do the scene."
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "I'm a cold-blooded punk!"
4, 60, "Network President", "I once put a laugh track on a sitcom that had no jokes in it."
4, 60, "Bender", "Hey, look! The prop guy has a lamp!"
4, 60, "Network President", "Really?"
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "Wha?"
4, 60, "Bender", "Aha!"
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "I was using that!"
4, 60, "Bender", "Listen up, 'cause I've got a climactic speech! You, cameraman, keep the camera rolling. You, director, gimmie my motivation."
4, 60, "Director", "You're angry."
4, 60, "Bender", "Perfect.  Viewers of the world, do smoking and drinking on TV really make me cool? Of course they do.  How 'bout committing crimes and violence? Again, the answer is ""yes"". But do we really want our kids exposed to that kind of trash on TV? I say absolutely not!  Uh ... on the other hand, most, perhaps all the blame, rests with the parents. That's right, you!  And so I ask you this one question"
4, 60, "Hermes", "We're just so busy."
4, 60, "Bender", "Well make time."
4, 60, "Director", "And ... cut!"
4, 60, "Calculon", "Good enough. Splice in some reaction shots of me and shove it on the air."
4, 60, "Bender", ""
4, 60, "Hermes", "Well, I'd say we all learned a valuable lesson about TV there."
4, 60, "Cubert", "What was it?"
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "Uh ... that we should all take TV a little less seriously. And more importantly, turn it off once in a while."
4, 60, "Fry", "Hear, hear!"
4, 60, "Leela", "Yeah!"
4, 60, "Bender", "Damn right!"
4, 60, "Dwight", "So, should we turn it off now?"
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "Well, uh, that depends what's on."
4, 60, "Fry", "Nothing good."
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "Ah, let's just keep watching."
4, 60, "Bender", "TV party tonight!"
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "Wha?"
4, 60, "Bender", "TV party tonight!"
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "Oh!"
4, 60, "Fry", "We've got nothing better to do."
4, 60, "Leela", "Than watch TV and have a couple of brews!"
4, 60, "Zoidberg", "Don't wanna talk about anything else."
4, 60, "Fry", "We don't wanna know!"
4, 60, "Farnsworth", "We're dedicated, yes!"
4, 60, "Hermes", "To our favourite shows!"
4, 60, "Cubert", "All My Circuits"
4, 60, "Dwight", "Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad!"
4, 60, "Amy", "Scary Door!"
4, 60, "Leela", "Blernsday Night Blernsball!"
4, 60, "Bender", "Futurama!"
4, 61, "Bender", "For my next trick, notice I have nothing up my sleeves ...  ... and nothing in my head.  So if my lovely assistant will kindly supply me with an ordinary, non-fake pitcher of milk...  Behold, the milk has vanished! Exiled, perhaps, to another dimension!"
4, 61, "Fry", "Amazing! That's why they call you ""Bender the Magnificent""!"
4, 61, "Bender", "No, it isn't."
4, 61, "Fry", "Whoa! They discovered an intact, 20th century pizzeria, just like the one I used to work at."
4, 61, "Bender", "Interesting. No, wait, the other thing ... tedious."
4, 61, "Fry", "Let's go check it out. You can see how I lived before I met you."
4, 61, "Bender", "You lived before you met me?"
4, 61, "Fry", "Sure. Lots of people did."
4, 61, "Bender", "Really?"
4, 61, "Bender", "Truly, they were as gods who built this place!"
4, 61, "Tour Guide", "Next, we come to the splendidly-preserved wooden pizza paddle.  Scientists theorise it was used to gently discipline the delivery boy."
4, 61, "Fry", "Wait a second! This is Panucci's! I used to work in this exact pizzeria!  And for your information, lady, this was not just used to paddle my butt. It was also used to move pizzas and crush rats."
4, 61, "Tour Guide", "I don't know where you get your facts, sir, but I am a volunteer housewife with 45 minutes of orientation and a Harlequin romance about archaeologists."
4, 61, "Fry", "Don't wave your fancy degrees at me! I recognise all this stuff.  Petrified sausages, old Mr. Patelli. And that's--"
4, 61, "Man", "Yes?"
4, 61, "Fry", "Pizza delivery for Mr. ...  ... Seymour Asses."
4, 61, "Man", "There's no one by that name here ... or anywhere. I hope that in time you'll realise what an idiot you've been."
4, 61, "Fry", "I wouldn't count on that."
4, 61, "Fry", "Aw! Poor little guy. You look like you haven't eaten in a month. Here ...  ... but if Mr. Panucci asks, your name is Seymour Asses.  I like you, Seymour. You're not constantly judging me like all the other dogs ... are you? Nah! We understand each other.  People think you're just a dumb mutt who smells bad, can't find a girlfriend and has a crummy job. But you're keepin' it real and you call no man ""Mister"".  Well, goodbye.  Live long and prosper."
4, 61, "Bender", "Yuck! That's the least appetising calzone I've ever seen!"
4, 61, "Fry", "No! That's my dog in there. It's an outrage, I say!  I'm taking him home and I'd like to see anyone try and stop me.  Uh-oh!"
4, 61, "Bender", "And then he was ejected by the guards. Needless to say, I was mortified."
4, 61, "Fry", "Well it's not right to make my dead pet an exhibit. That's like digging up Lassie and putting her on display in the Louvre."
4, 61, "Amy", "Lassie is on display in the Louvre."
4, 61, "Fry", "I know. I was deliberately describing a similar situation."
4, 61, "Farnsworth", "Why don't you try protesting? Like those native Martians; always whining that people don't treat their ancestor's bones with respect."
4, 61, "Bender", "Nah, protesting never works."
4, 61, "Fry", "You're right.  I'll give it a shot!"
4, 61, "Crowd", "What do you want?"
4, 61, "Fry", "Fry's dog!"
4, 61, "Crowd", "When do you want it?"
4, 61, "Fry", "Fry's dog!  I will now perform my people's native dance."
4, 61, "Leela", "It says this part of The Hustle implores the gods to grant a favour. Usually a Trans-AM."
4, 61, "Fry", "I'm walking on sunshine! Oh-oh-oh!  I'm walking on sunshine! Oh-oh-oh!   That a boy, Seymour! Right here waiting for me as always. Just like that huge mushroom in my shower."
4, 61, "Panucci", "Hey! There's our little mascot.  Aw, you been swimming in the sewer again?  You rascal!  Fry, cleanup!"
4, 61, "Fry", "Seymour, cleanup!  Good dog!"
4, 61, "Panucci", "That's a good Seymour!"
4, 61, "Boy", "Yo! There's dog fur on my slice!"
4, 61, "Panucci", "Nah, that's vermicelli! No fur in here!"
4, 61, "Fry", "He's so cute! He can do two things at one time"
4, 61, "Leela", "Fry, it's been three days. You can't keep boogie-ing like this. You'll come down with a fever of some sort."
4, 61, "Ben Beeler", "Mr. Fry? I'm Dr. Ben Beeler, the palaeontologist who discovered your dog. Or as some call it, the ""Beelersaurus""."
4, 61, "Fry", "So do I get Seymour back? Are you caving to political pressure?"
4, 61, "Beeler", "No, we're sorry but there's just too much that fossil can teach us about dogs from your time."
4, 61, "Fry", "His name was Seymour. He was once intimate with the leg of a wandering saxophonist. He had wet dog smell, even when dry. And he was not above chasing the number 29 bus."
4, 61, "Ray", "The 29? Interesting."
4, 61, "Beeler", "That's all I needed. Ray?"
4, 61, "Ray", "I'm good."
4, 61, "Beeler", "OK then. Here's your dog back."
4, 61, "Fry", "Seymour!"
4, 61, "Bender", "Lady and gentleman! How 'bout a hand for my temporary replacement assistant?"
4, 61, "Zoidberg", "I was all in this part! It's magic!"
4, 61, "Bender", "You are not fit to wear Fry's leotard!"
4, 61, "Zoidberg", "Stop!"
4, 61, "Fry", "Good news, everyone!"
4, 61, "Bender", "Hooray, he's back! And he's looking for a garbage can to put the rock in! Here you go, buddy!"
4, 61, "Farnsworth", "No. Actually we've discovered that Fry's dog was fast-fossilised, preserving it's cellular structure!"
4, 61, "Fry", "Which means we can clone it! Seymour will live again!"
4, 61, "Zoidberg", "A little land mammal!"
4, 61, "Fry", "Can you believe it, Bender? I'm going to have my best friend back!"
4, 61, "Cubert", "Why the idiot convention?"
4, 61, "Farnsworth", "Ah, Cubert, my precious babe. I'm going to attempt to clone Fry's dog using the very same apparatus I used to clone you.  Ooh, look! There's a smidge of toe still in here.  You see, beneath the fossil's crunchy, mineral shell, there's still a creamy core of dog nougat."
4, 61, "Fry", "So will Seymour remember how to sing Walking On Sunshine?"
4, 61, "Farnsworth", "Amazingly, yes. In cases of rapid fossilisation, I can press this brain scan button, retrieving Seymour's memories at the precise instant of doggy death."
4, 61, "Fry", "I'm gonna get my puppy back! In your face, Grim Reaper!"
4, 61, "Bender", "Crappy ineffective Reaper!"
4, 61, "Farnsworth", "I just need to reset the Clone-O-Mat from Human Mode to Dog Mode."
4, 61, "Computer Voice", "The dog says--"
4, 61, "Farnsworth", "Uh-oh, this may take a while."
4, 61, "Boy", "You stink, loser!"
4, 61, "Panucci", "Hey, Fry. Pizza goin' out. C'mon!"
4, 61, "Fry", "But I'm celebrating New Year's Eve."
4, 61, "Panucci", "Like you got squat to celebrate! You're a delivery boy this millennium and you'll be a delivery boy next millennium!  What's with Seymour? It's like he don't want you to go. Or he thinks your pants is too short, or somethin'. Which is crazy 'cause, frankly, you look fabulous. Now get goin'!"
4, 61, "Fry", "I won't be gone long, Seymour. Just wait here till I come back."
4, 61, "Fry", "Hello? Pizza delivery for ...  ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud!  Here's to another lousy millennium."
4, 61, "Crowd", "Five, four, three, two."
4, 61, "Fry", "What the--?"
4, 61, "Bender", "A dog collar, for me?  You shouldn't have!"
4, 61, "Fry", "That's for Seymour."
4, 61, "Bender", "Oh."
4, 61, "Bender", "Say, why'd you get me a subscription to the Daily Growl?  That's not a reputable journal of opinion."
4, 61, "Fry", "Oh, that's also for Seymour. I'm getting everything ready for when he's cloned."
4, 61, "Bender", "Are you on the junk, Fry? Why are you wasting time on a creature of inferior intelligence?"
4, 61, "Fry", "Hey, he was smart! He could fetch."
4, 61, "Bender", "I can fetch."
4, 61, "Fry", "He could dig up bones."
4, 61, "Bender", "Hello? Charlemagne?  Plus, I bet he couldn't create a laser show with his head."
4, 61, "Fry", "Look, Bender, this has nothing to do with you."
4, 61, "Bender", "That's impossible!"
4, 61, "Fry", "Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm working on Seymour's doghouse."
4, 61, "Bender", "No one ever asks if Bender would like to live in a tiny little house. Not that I would. A tiny little house that says ""Bender"" on it.  Ow!"
4, 61, "Fry", "This is Fry. If you're calling about the used towels for sale, they're still available for $45 each."
4, 61, "Mr. Fry", "Phil, it's your father. Where are you? You're holding up New Year's brunch. Your brother can't wait any longer."
4, 61, "Yancy", "Hello, first baloney of the new millennium!  Ah, here he comes. That's him and Seymour."
4, 61, "Mrs. Fry", "Well that's weird. Seymour's here but--  Go! Go! Touchdown! But where's Philip?"
4, 61, "Mr. Fry", "I'm tellin' you, the Y2K computer's got him. We'll face burnin' roads, rivers exploding, calculators transformed into Scud missiles. There's nothing we can do.  What's that, Seymour? You walking on sunshine?"
4, 61, "Yancy", "He's trying to tell us something. Maybe he can lead us to Philip."
4, 61, "Yancy", "Should we follow him?"
4, 61, "Mr. Fry", "To our deaths? Negatory."
4, 61, "Mr. Fry", "It's the Y2K tryin' to lure us into an ambush. And I ain't buyin' it. Pass the baloney."
4, 61, "Fry", "Are you two gonna be done soon?"
4, 61, "Leela", "Sorry, but we need to practise hand-to-hand combat in case an enemy knocks the laser guns out of our hands and they slide way across the room."
4, 61, "Fry", "Well could you do it some place else? I'm setting up Seymour's doggy bed."
4, 61, "Leela", "OK."
4, 61, "Bender", "Heel, boy, heel! Oh, hello, Fry! I guess I didn't notice you there. I'm having such fun with my new best friend, Robo-Puppy."
4, 61, "Fry", "That's nice."
4, 61, "Bender", "I was just out walking him. Yes, you can walk him. Of course, after he goes you have to refill the canisters. C'mere, boy! Pet, pet, pet."
4, 61, "Robo-Puppy", "Robo-Puppy receiving petting."
4, 61, "Amy", "Bender, are you jealous of Fry's puppy? That's so adorable!"
4, 61, "Bender", "Jealous?  Not while I have the love of Robo-Puppy here. Robo-Puppy, lick my cheek."
4, 61, "Robo-Puppy", "Robo-Puppy preparing to lick cheek.  Robo-Puppy commencing cheek-licking. Licking in progress. Licking complete."
4, 61, "Bender", "Robo-Puppy truly is robot's best friend, huh?"
4, 61, "Fry", "Ah, there! Perfect!"
4, 61, "Holo-Farnsworth", "Good news, everyone! The Clone-O-Mat is ready!"
4, 61, "Fry", "Finally!"
4, 61, "Robo-Puppy", "Robo-Puppy commencing two-hour yipping session.  Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert! Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert!"
4, 61, "Farnsworth", "Behold once more, the mighty Clone-O-Mat! Requiring such vast amounts of electricity that we must harness the elemental power of nature itself.  I speak, of course, of molten lava deep within the Earth's core. To the sub-basement!"
4, 61, "Farnsworth", "Powering up Clone-O-Mat.  Placing fossil on the Plat-Clone-O-Form.  Initiating dog brain CAT scan."
4, 61, "Fry", "Come on, boy! Come back to life!"
4, 61, "Farnsworth", "Know ye now what feels like to be dog god! Commencing DNA extraction."
4, 61, "Bender", "Fry, c'mon, the talent show!"
4, 61, "Fry", "What? I'm in the middle of something."
4, 61, "Bender", "But, if we don't perform, in what sense do we have an act?"
4, 61, "Fry", "Bender, enough! Leave me alone!"
4, 61, "Bender", "So that's how it is, huh? I thought you were my friend. But if you love your dog so much, maybe you'd rather play fetch!"
4, 61, "Leela", "No!"
4, 61, "Zoidberg", "Oh!"
4, 61, "Bender", "Now I'm all you got!"
4, 61, "Fry", "I hate you! I hate you! You evil metal man!  Ow!"
4, 61, "Bender", "So anyway your dog is melted. Now we're friends again."
4, 61, "Farnsworth", "Not necessarily. For the dog may yet survive."
4, 61, "Fry", "May yet? Really?"
4, 61, "Farnsworth", "Indeed. You see, that fossil was made of dolomite; The tough black mineral that won't cop out when there's heat all about. By contrast, observe the lava's affect on this ice swan.  Of course, that would have melted even at room temperature. I just wanted to get rid of it. But had it been made of that righteous mineral dolomite, there's a slim chance it might have survived."
4, 61, "Fry", "So Seymour might still exist?"
4, 61, "Farnsworth", "Perhaps, for a few minutes. It's dolomite, baby!"
4, 61, "Fry", "Then I'm goin' in after him."
4, 61, "Amy", "No!"
4, 61, "Leela", "Stop!"
4, 61, "Fry", "He'd come after me!"
4, 61, "Leela", "Acting like a moron won't bring your dog back."
4, 61, "Fry", "Then all hope is lost.  Goodbye, Seymour."
4, 61, "Bender", "Please stop crying, Fry. Here.  I assumed you were just pretending to love the dog to toy with my emotions. Oh, what have I done?"
4, 61, "Zoidberg", "You didn't do anything. Don't beat yourself up."
4, 61, "Bender", "Fry, I'm sorry. I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature, because I love you. Not in the way of the Ancient Greeks, but the way a robot loves a human, a human loves a dog and, occasionally, a gorilla loves a kitty.  I'm goin' in!"
4, 61, "Farnsworth", "I'm a professor! Why isn't anyone listening to me? You can't go in because you'll melt. The fossil only has a chance because it's made of dolomite."
4, 61, "Bender", "I'm 40% dolomite!  Oh, it's hot! It's very hot!"
4, 61, "Cryogenisist", "Ugh! I am one hungover cryogenisist. Just throw that mutt in the freezer till his owners get here."
4, 61, "Plumber", "You can't solve all your problems by freezing them, boss."
4, 61, "Cryogenisist", "I think you're forgetting our motto."
4, 61, "Mr. Fry", "Are you the cryogenisist who called about our son's dog?"
4, 61, "Cryogenisist", "Oh, you must be the Frys. Yeah, he's right over there."
4, 61, "Mrs. Fry", "Sorry we're late. We all got sick from eating bad baloney."
4, 61, "Mr. Fry", "Y2K!"
4, 61, "Mrs. Fry", "What's he so worked up about?"
4, 61, "Mr. Fry", "He's just upset 'cause our boy's missing.  C'mon, you overgrown rat. Lead us to Philip."
4, 61, "Leela", "Bender's been down there too long. I'm going in after him."
4, 61, "Farnsworth", "Professor! Lava! Hot!"
4, 61, "Fry", "This is all my fault. I let my best friend risk his life just to get my dead dog back.  Bender!"
4, 61, "Bender", "And that is why they call me Bender the Magnificent!  Hey, where'd everybody go?"
4, 61, "Bender", "OK! Let's clone us some dog!"
4, 61, "Fry", "Yeah!"
4, 61, "Farnsworth", "Very well. Let this abomination unto the Lord begin! [He pulls the chain again and Seymour is zapped and his DNA is extracted. ""Species"
4, 61, "Fry", "15? You mean he lived for 12 more years after I got frozen?"
4, 61, "Farnsworth", "Indeed."
4, 61, "Fry", "Stop the cloning."
4, 61, "Farnsworth", "Oh, sure! Smash the smart guy's machine!"
4, 61, "Bender", "Fry, what's wrong?"
4, 61, "Fry", "Think about it"
4, 61, "Bender", "But that's a good thing. Walking On Sunshine sucks noodles!"
4, 61, "Fry", "I had Seymour till he was three. That's when I knew him and that's when I loved him.  I'll never forget him. But he forgot me a long, long time ago."
4, 62, "Zoidberg", "Hurry up with the water. I'm steaming inside my own shell, I am. It's that hot, it is!"
4, 62, "Leela", "Hi-yah!"
4, 62, "Fry", "Man, it's hot!  How hot is it?  It's so hot, I poured McDonald's coffee in my lap to cool off.  Johnny Carson said it."
4, 62, "Leela", "No, Nibbler! Don't drink the pool water! It's full of chlorine!"
4, 62, "Bender", "Lightweights! Oh, wait, chlorine!"
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "Perhaps this movie will help us take our minds off the heat."
4, 62, "Bender", "Focus!"
4, 62, "Narrator", "Global Warming Or"
4, 62, "Narrator", "You're probably wondering why your ice cream went away. Well, Suzie, the culprit isn't foreigners, it's global warming!"
4, 62, "Suzie", "Gwobal wappa?"
4, 62, "Narrator", "Uh, yeah! Meet Mr. Sunbeam. He comes all the way from the sun to visit Earth."
4, 62, "Mr. Sunbeam", "Hello, Earth! Just poppin' in to brighten your day!  And now I'll be on my way!"
4, 62, "Gas", "Not so fast, Sunbeam! We're greenhouse gases. You ain't goin' nowhere!"
4, 62, "Mr. Sunbeam", "Ooh! Ah! Oh, God, it hurts!"
4, 62, "Narrator", "Pretty soon, Earth is chock-full of sunbeams ...  ... their rotting corpses heating our atmosphere."
4, 62, "Suzie", "How do we get wid of the gweenhouse grasses?"
4, 62, "Narrator", "Fortunately, our handsomest politicians came up with a cheap, last-minute way to combat global warming. Ever since 2063 we simply drop a giant ice cube into the ocean every now and then."
4, 62, "Suzie", "Just like Daddy puts in his drink every morning.  And then he gets mad."
4, 62, "Narrator", "Of course, since the greenhouse gases are still building up, it takes more and more ice each time.  Thus solving the problem once and for all."
4, 62, "Suzie", "But--"
4, 62, "Narrator", "Once and for all!"
4, 62, "Leela", "Well, we just need one of those big ice cubes. Someone should call the losers who are supposed to deliver it.  Hello?"
4, 62, "Nixon", "President Nixon here.  I'm hiring you losers to deliver the ice. And hurry up! I'm sweating like J. Edgar Hoover trying to squeeze into a new girdle!"
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "You heard the good news, everyone! Save the Earth, et cetera, et cetera!  Bye!"
4, 62, "Fry", "Wait! Where do we get the ice?"
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "The wha? Oh, Halley's Comet, of course. The only sufficient source of ice cubes that don't have bugs in them."
4, 62, "Fry", "Wow! Mining a comet! That sounds fun."
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "Yes, there's no safer occupation than mining. Especially when you're perched on a snowball whipping through space at a million miles an hour.  Safe!"
4, 62, "Bender", "Deploying ice drill."
4, 62, "Fry", "Wow! That ice dispenser's so big, the ice crushes you!  Yakov Smirnov said it."
4, 62, "Leela", "No, he didn't."
4, 62, "Bender", "Activating ice drill."
4, 62, "Fry", "Oh, my God! It's out of ice! Like some outer space Motel 6!"
4, 62, "Leela", "Completely out of ice?"
4, 62, "Bender", "This could mean the end of the banana daiquiri as we know it ... also life."
4, 62, "Linda", "With Halley's Comet out of ice, Earth is experiencing the devastating effects of sudden intense global warming."
4, 62, "Morbo", "Morbo is pleased but sticky. The scorching heat has melted the polar ice caps, causing floods of biblical proportion."
4, 62, "Randy", "They called me crazy for building this ark."
4, 62, "Soupy", "You are crazy. You filled it with same-sex animal couples!"
4, 62, "Randy", "Hey! There are parts of the Bible I like and parts I don't like."
4, 62, "Morbo", "Direct your attention now to the African turtles seen here migrating to cooler homes in Holland."
4, 62, "Bender", "That poor turtle!"
4, 62, "Fry", "Bender? Are you crying?"
4, 62, "Bender", "Uh, no! Never!"
4, 62, "Morbo", "Morbo wishes these stalwart nomads peace among the Dutch tulips."
4, 62, "Linda", "I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool."
4, 62, "Morbo", "Windmills do not work that way!  Goodnight!"
4, 62, "Bender", "Well, everybody, I just saved a turtle. What have you done with your lives?"
4, 62, "Hermes", "You went all the way to Holland already?"
4, 62, "Leela", "Bender, a turtle isn't yourself. Why do you care about it?"
4, 62, "Bender", "Because I also care deeply about things that remind me of myself. Like poor little Shelly here."
4, 62, "Hermes", "What could you possibly have in common with this walking soup mix?"
4, 62, "Bender", "For one thing, we both have a tough outer shell.  But lead a rich, inner life. And also ... well, you know."
4, 62, "Leela", "You're both alcoholic, whore-mongering, chain-smoking gamblers?"
4, 62, "Bender", "No! It's just ... neither of us can get up when we get knocked on our back."
4, 62, "Fry", "What? I've seen you get up off your back tons of times."
4, 62, "Bender", "Those times I was slightly on my side."
4, 62, "Hermes", "Interesting. Maybe we should test this erectile dysfunction of yours, Bender."
4, 62, "Bender", "Uh, no! That's not necessary, really! I think I hear my factory recalling me.  Oh! That's what I get for sharing my vulnerability with you."
4, 62, "Van", "Calling all scientists, calling all scientists. Be advised there will be a worldwide conference on global warming in Kyoto, Japan."
4, 62, "Man", "I've got a degree in homeopathic medicine!"
4, 62, "Van", "You've got a degree in baloney!"
4, 62, "Amy", "Professor Farnsworth, you're a scientist!"
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "Forget it, I'm not going! I have my reasons! Shut up, all of you!"
4, 62, "Hermes", "Strange. You haven't acted this suspicious since I found those ""ape bones"" in the basement."
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "My hip hurts! I'm in the middle of cooking a turkey! I have warranty cards to fill out! I am not just making excuses! Alright, I'll go!"
4, 62, "Woman #1", "Oh, God, I can't believe it!"
4, 62, "Woman #2", "I love you!"
4, 62, "Rivers", "Oh, oh, oh! It's Professor Hubert Farnsworth! He's looking sharp in a standard white lab coat and dark slacks! His wristwatch is a Casio."
4, 62, "Van", "Thank you all for coming. It is my pleasure to introduce the host of the Kyoto Global Warming Convention. The inventor of the environment and first Emperor of the Moon"
4, 62, "Al Gore's head", "I have ridden the mighty Moon Worm."
4, 62, "Fry", "Good for him!"
4, 62, "Gore", "My fellow Earthicans, as I discuss in my book Earth in the Balance and the much more popular Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth, we need to defend our planet against pollution. As well as dark wizards."
4, 62, "Dark Wizard", "Sure! Blame the wizards!"
4, 62, "Gore", "That's why I'm offering a bag of Moon Sapphires to the first scientist who can solve this problem once and for all.  Lovely, aren't they?"
4, 62, "Dark Wizard", "Sapphires?  With those I could open the Gate of Kerash!"
4, 62, "Gore", "First up is Professor Ogden Wernstrom."
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "Wernstrom!"
4, 62, "Wernstrom", "Ladies and gentlemen, I have placed in orbit a giant mirror that will reflect 40% of the sun's rays, thus cooling Earth. Observe."
4, 62, "Wernstrom", "Problem solved."
4, 62, "Man", "Ooh! That's a little bright."
4, 62, "Gore", "Alright, what else we got?"
4, 62, "Fry", "Professor, you're a professor. You must have some ideas."
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "Absolutely not! I won't speak! I've got nothing to hide!"
4, 62, "Gore", "Our next speaker is Professor--"
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "I demand the floor!"
4, 62, "Gore", "Yes, it's your turn to speak."
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "Well nuts to me. I'm taking the stage!  I know the source of the greenhouse gases. But in my shame I've kept it secret for 75 long years. Oh, it haunts my memory still."
4, 62, "Fry", "Professor, no! Don't do it!"
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "Don't do what? Don't use this memory ray so I can remember what happened back then?"
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "It was October 17th at 1"
4, 62, "Prototype", "Oh, dear. Might I favour master with a tender kiss on the forehead?"
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "Oh, I've failed again."
4, 62, "Prototype", "Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!"
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "The owner of the company pressured me to create a bigger sportier robot."
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "Stop!"
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "It wasn't easy but, by sacrificing fuel efficiency, I succeeded."
4, 62, "Mom", "What was that?"
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "A flaming burp."
4, 62, "Mom", "Does it always do that?"
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "It's not always a burp. We still have one problem though"
4, 62, "Mom", "Crap spackle!  We'll just call it a sport utility robot and classify it as a light truck."
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "Well, I suppose the environment can take one more for the team."
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "What a fool I was. If only I had made the effort to develop a cleaner-burning robot. But I was tired and in love."
4, 62, "Mom", "Take me now, you stud!"
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "Oh, this is all my fault!"
4, 62, "Fry", "That's awful, Professor. Especially the making-out part."
4, 62, "Gore", "Yeah, I didn't need to hear that."
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "All modern robots descend from my original smog-blasting designs. And that's the cause of global warming today."
4, 62, "Wernstrom", "Huh, so the robots are to blame. As I suspected.  We are left with only one possible course of action, grim though it be."
4, 62, "Bender", "I got a good feeling about this!"
4, 62, "Wernstrom", "We must immediately and permanently shut down, dismantle and destroy all robots!"
4, 62, "Bender", "No!"
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "Wait, surely there's a better--"
4, 62, "Van", "The conference is over."
4, 62, "Gore", "I must go now, to help collect cans on Jupiter. Peace out, y'all!"
4, 62, "Crowd", "Destroy all robots! Destroy all robots!"
4, 62, "Amy", "Poor Bender."
4, 62, "Fry", "Be brave, my friend."
4, 62, "Leela", "Come on. You've got to come out of your chest sometime.  Would you do it for a Bender snack?"
4, 62, "Fry", "Aha!"
4, 62, "Leela", "Gotcha!"
4, 62, "Bender", "Let me go! I don't even want the stupid beer!  Yes! You tried to trick me into coming out of my chest. But who has the beer now?  I've got mail!"
4, 62, "Amy", "Ooh! It's a party, apparently."
4, 62, "Nixon", "Do you like to party? To boogie down? Well I'm throwing an all-night beach raver for my robot pals. It all goes down Saturday on the isolated Galapagos Islands where there will be no escape ... from the fun! All robots must attend."
4, 62, "Zoidberg", "Strange"
4, 62, "Leela", "We all figured that out."
4, 62, "Bender", "Well, I'm off."
4, 62, "Fry", "Wait! We could hide you. We'll pile fruit on you and claim you're a bowl."
4, 62, "Bender", "No. I'm going to the party."
4, 62, "Fry", "I won't let you!"
4, 62, "Bender", "Fry, as you know, there are lots of things I'm willing to kill for. Jewels, vengeance, Father O'Mally's weed whacker. But, at long last, I've found something I'm willing to die for"
4, 62, "Fry", "Bender, this world isn't good enough for you."
4, 62, "Bender", "Not even close. Goodbye, everybody! Don't touch my stuff after I'm dead.   It's booby trapped!"
4, 62, "Robot #1", "Oh, yeah!"
4, 62, "Robot #2", "Come on, baby!"
4, 62, "Bender", "Poor guy. Maybe you'd feel better if I had a drink.  Crummy keg! It's completely ta-- Oh, you're a robot!"
4, 62, "Keg Robot", "Don't stop!"
4, 62, "Bender", "Ew!"
4, 62, "Nixon", "Attention, happening robots"
4, 62, "Crushinator", "Do you want to dance?"
4, 62, "Bender", "Nah, I'm not really in the--"
4, 62, "Crushinator", "You know you want to."
4, 62, "Wernstrom", "Per your orders, I modified my mirror to fire a colossal electromagnetic pulse at the Galapagos. Every robot will be instantly and painfully terminated. Now for your part of the bargain."
4, 62, "Nixon", "Aroo! Very well. Agnew, you belong to Wernstrom now."
4, 62, "Bender", "I'll say goodbye now. There ain't not turtles where daddy's a-going.  Don't tell anybody, but Nixon's about to shut all robots off and--"
4, 62, "Boom Mic-bot", "What?"
4, 62, "Robot #3", "We're gonna die!"
4, 62, "Preacherbot", "We're going to the great beyond!"
4, 62, "Chain Smoker", "Nixon's not bringing the smokes!"
4, 62, "Bender", "Shut up and pay attention to me, Bender!  Look, I love life and its pleasures as much as anyone here. Except perhaps you, Hedonismbot.  But we need to be shut off! Especially you, Hedonismbot!"
4, 62, "Hedonismbot", "I apologise for nothing!"
4, 62, "Bender", "We pollute too much. We're destroying the world and killing the turtles."
4, 62, "Preacherbot", "To hell with the turtles!"
4, 62, "Bender", "No one insults the turtles!"
4, 62, "Preacherbot", "Oh, mercy!"
4, 62, "Bender", "Come on!"
4, 62, "Hedonismbot", "Let the games begin!"
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "Everyone, listen!"
4, 62, "Preacherbot", "Aw, damn!"
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "I've devised a way to save you and stop global warming at the same time. Granted, you're all blasting out greenhouse gases--"
4, 62, "Bender", "You're one to talk!"
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "But we can use those very gases to save the planet. If you all vent your exhaust directly upward in one burst, it should thrust the Earth further from the sun, thus cooling it.  By my calculations, we'll need the full force of every last robot. So, quickly, everyone point your exhaust vents straight upwards.  Now vent! Vent like the wind!  Harder! Harder!"
4, 62, "Fry", "Why isn't this working?!"
4, 62, "Leela", "Some lazy or polite robot is holding it in."
4, 62, "Bender", "Help! Help!"
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "A billion robot lives are about to be extinguished. Oh, the Jedis are going to feel this one!"
4, 62, "Bender", "I'm sorry, buddy. At least we'll die on our backs, helpless.  Huh? What the hell are you doing?  Hey, you trying to make me look bad?  Aha! I'm even greater than I thought I was! And now to fulfill my destiny."
4, 62, "Nixon", "Fire!  What the--?"
4, 62, "Wernstrom", "We missed!"
4, 62, "Nixon", "Professor, for saving the Earth and foiling me, I proudly, yet angrily, present you with Earth's new highest honour"
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "Thank you. I deserve this!"
4, 62, "Bender", "Hey, Professor, now that the Earth's orbit is further from the sun, won't that make the year longer?"
4, 62, "Farnsworth", "Why, yes! One week longer to be exact."
4, 62, "Nixon", "In that case I hereby declare it Robot Party Week!"
4, 62, "Bender", "Alright, baby!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Pazuzu, you ungrateful gargoyle! I put you through college, and this is how you repay me?"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Let's get this gargoyle hunt on the road. Driving gloves, driving goggles, driving thong. There!"
4, 63, "Leela", "Uh, maybe I should drive."
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "You? A woman? I'm trying to catch a monster, not find the quickest route to the mall! Let me just adjust the seat."
4, 63, "Fry", "My God! He's gonna do it! Everybody, seatbelts to maximum buckling."
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Pazuzu? Oh, Pazuzu?"
4, 63, "Randy", "Hey, grandpa, move your wrinkly old kiester!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Shut up!"
4, 63, "Leela", "For Heaven's Gate, Professor. This ship can do 99% light speed. Why are we going 35 miles an hour?"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Because we're in a hurry, that's why."
4, 63, "Leela", "Plus, you have the high beams on!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "I can't quite read the sign.  Pazuzu? Pazuzu?"
4, 63, "Bender", "Yo, Captain Cataract? What are we doing here?"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Oh, it's 2.30. We can still catch the early bird dinner special."
4, 63, "Fry", "Uh, aren't we looking for your gargoyle?"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "My wha?"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Hello, Mavis! Surprised to see me back again so soon?"
4, 63, "Wanda", "Mavis is dead."
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "I expect you'll want to see my angry, crotchety, grandpa discount card."
4, 63, "Wanda", "Sir, this card has expired."
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "But it's good for a lifetime."
4, 63, "Wanda", "Well, yours expired."
4, 63, "Leela", "Oh, Lord! Teeth do not belong in your pants, Professor."
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Well, I can't keep them in my mouth. They're nuclear-powered!"
4, 63, "Fry", "Ow! It bit my finger!"
4, 63, "Leela", "No! No! It's tasted human blood!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Mmm! Damn good meat!"
4, 63, "Leela", "Professor, we've talked it over and everybody thinks you're too old."
4, 63, "Amy", "Right on."
4, 63, "Fry", "Yup."
4, 63, "Bender", "Uh-huh!"
4, 63, "Hermes", "We've decided to do the merciful thing and have you euthasised."
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Dear God, no!"
4, 63, "Amy", "Oh, relax, Professor. ""Youthasizing"" is a trendy, new spa treatment. It's this season's shark-cartilage enema."
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "But I like being old. I don't have to talk to my parents, no one asks me to help move their stuff, I don't need to understand today's ""edgy"" TV sitcoms."
4, 63, "Leela", "OK, OK. We're not gonna force you until I finish this sentence. Get him!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "My thong!"
4, 63, "Heather", "Hi! I'm Heather, your personal Youthasizer. Let's get started with a nice botulism treatment, shall we?"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Go to hell, Heather!"
4, 63, "Heather", "Oh!  In small doses, botchelism toxin tightens and tones the facial muscles instead of killing you in the most horrible fashion imaginable."
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Give me back my floppy face!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Careful with the giblets!"
4, 63, "Heather", "Hmm. You're still retaining a lot of grump in these joints.  More pressure."
4, 63, "Heather", "Since this is such a serious case of old, we'll have to try our strongest treatment"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "You sound just like my tennis instructor."
4, 63, "Heather", "The tar blisters the age right out of the body in what top scientists suspect is a miracle."
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain."
4, 63, "Fry", "He still sounds sorta old. Sorta real old."
4, 63, "Bender", "Step aside, lady.  Like everything else in life, pumping is just a primitive, degenerate form of bending.   C'mon, Bender, pump harder! Harder!  I'm trying as hard as I can.  Harder, damn you!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Well, that was an utter waste of time."
4, 63, "Amy", "Professor, it worked! You look young enough to be my father!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Poodle spit!  53 years old?  Now I'll need a fake ID to rent ultra-porn."
4, 63, "Fry", "This is great, Professor! We should go out and celebrate!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Dear Lord! You've all reverted to your childhood forms."
4, 63, "Zoidberg", "Hooray! I'm a teenage heartthrob again!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "While I try to restore our normal ages, I expect you all to go about your jobs like responsible professionals."
4, 63, "Hermes", "It wasn't me, Mr. F. It was Amy!  Stop it, Amy!"
4, 63, "Amy", "You stink!"
4, 63, "Hermes", "You know you did it!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Quiet! Quiet, I say!"
4, 63, "LaBarbara", "We're here to take my little stub of a husband home. Hermes, say goodbye to Mr. Farnsworth."
4, 63, "Hermes", "Goodbye, Mr. Dumbsworth!"
4, 63, "Leela", "Hey! This my chance to spend time with my parents too."
4, 63, "Fry", "But your parents are gross sewer mutants."
4, 63, "Leela", "When I was an orphan, I always wished I could grow up with my mom and dad. And now, thanks to being hurled backwards in time--"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "That's not what happened! Shut up and go live with your parents."
4, 63, "Leela", "It's gonna be totally awesome, Mom! You and me can bake and argue about my hairstyle hiding my pretty face. And if some kid picks on me, my dad can beat up his dad."
4, 63, "Morris", "Can't I just beat up the kid?"
4, 63, "Munda", "Well, OK, Leela. If you think you can put up with your father, then welcome home. We'll try to respect your independence and freedom."
4, 63, "Leela", "No! I want the real teen experience"
4, 63, "Morris", "Fine, Sweetiekins, we'll be the strictest parents ever. Now, let's all have some tequila to celebrate!"
4, 63, "Leela", "Dad! I'm underage!"
4, 63, "Morris", "Oh, right. Here's a silly straw."
4, 63, "Mrs. Wong", "Oh, my Amy's sweet little girl again! This is like a mother's dream. Bad dream, that is! At this rate, I'm never going to get a grandchild!"
4, 63, "Mr. Wong", "Maybe she not grown up but she sure grown out! She fat!"
4, 63, "Amy", "Dad, if you're gonna make fat jokes till I get cute again, I'm just gonna stay in my room."
4, 63, "Mr. Wong", "Stay in room? You so fat, you gonna stay all around room!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork every three hours. And those jerks at social security stopped sending me checks. Now I have to pay them!"
4, 63, "Bender", "I'm tired of your yapping.  All you ever do is complain, you never try to make things better. Well, I'm running away from this dead-end family! I know there's a place for people like me with new ideas. There has to be!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Fine! Get going!"
4, 63, "Bender", "Oh, I'm going! You're gonna be all ""Where's Bender? I miss Bender""."
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "We won't know that until you leave."
4, 63, "Bender", "Oh, I'm leaving!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "There's the door."
4, 63, "Bender", "I'll be good."
4, 63, "Munda", "Ah, do you have to shed your skin on the couch? What do we live in, a zoo?"
4, 63, "Morris", "I'm getting the doorbell.  For me?"
4, 63, "Fry", "Oh, uh, hello, sir. It's a lovely evening you have tonight. Um, I'm here to pick up your daughter."
4, 63, "Leela", "Hi, Fry! I like your blazer."
4, 63, "Fry", "Thanks. These aren't pockets, they're just flaps. I put my money in my sock."
4, 63, "Munda", "So, where are you taking my daughter tonight?"
4, 63, "Fry", "A movie.  A movie, ma'am."
4, 63, "Morris", "Well, whatever you're really doing, don't wake us if you get in after 12."
4, 63, "Leela", "Dad, you're being too lenient again! I have to be back by 11."
4, 63, "Munda", "OK, OK. You're the boss!"
4, 63, "Leela", "No, I'm not!"
4, 63, "Fry", "I'd like a sewer burger but without the rat faeces."
4, 63, "Leela", "What are you, on a diet?"
4, 63, "Moose", "Uh, Leela, you look hot."
4, 63, "Mandy", "Jeez, Moose! Just dump me right in front of her, why don't you."
4, 63, "Leela", "Moose, Mandy; this is my friend Fry, from the surface."
4, 63, "Mandy", "Oh, so this is the famous Fry. What is he, like, the biggest loser on the surface so he has to hang out in the sewer?"
4, 63, "Fry", "They're onto me!"
4, 63, "Leela", "Hey, come on! Let's act like grown-ups here. Wanna race?"
4, 63, "Moose", "Uh, yeah!"
4, 63, "Sal", "Theres. The world's drinkings water is safes for another days.  Whoas!  Cripe!"
4, 63, "Leela", "A tapeworm!"
4, 63, "Fry", "We missed the turn. We'll never catch them."
4, 63, "Leela", "Yes, we will. This sewer goes right under Planet Express, and it's 9pm!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "The devil take this predictable colon!"
4, 63, "Fry", "Yeah!"
4, 63, "Leela", "Alright!"
4, 63, "Fry", "Leela, you can stop winning now. We won!"
4, 63, "Leela", "I'm too short to reach the handbrake!"
4, 63, "Dwayne", "That's detention!"
4, 63, "Fry", "And then, and then, this giant tapeworm tried to play us for chumps but we like totally dissed Moose!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Yes, I'd like to meet this Moose. But, in the meantime, I have good news. I may have solved our age problem."
4, 63, "Fry", "Yay!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "It seems the Youthasizing tar was saturated with time-altering Chronitons. A thin layer is still stuck to our DNA as well as Bender's robo, or ""RNA""."
4, 63, "Bender", "Question."
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Yes?"
4, 63, "Bender", "You stink!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Yes, yes. Anyhow, I've designed an oil-eating bacterium that should take the tar right off."
4, 63, "Fry", "C'mon! Let's go tell Leela so we can grow up together!"
4, 63, "Leela", "Thanks, Professor. But I don't want the treatment."
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Don't you understand, you little nitwit? Unless you're treated soon, the only way to restore your true age would be to grow into it! Just as God intended."
4, 63, "Munda", "He has a point, honey. What about your job and your friends? Do you really want to abandon your old life?"
4, 63, "Leela", "My old life wasn't as glamorous as my webpage made it look. All I ever wanted was to grow up here, with you. Please?"
4, 63, "Munda", "Well if it's what you really want."
4, 63, "Leela", "It is. I know it is."
4, 63, "Fry", "I'll miss you, Leela. I'll come back and visit when I'm all grown up."
4, 63, "Leela", "Bring beer."
4, 63, "Morris", "No beer till you finish your tequila!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "The age-restoring microbes are ready. Everyone into the bacterial spew chamber."
4, 63, "Amy", "Let's go!"
4, 63, "Bender", "Yes, everyone do the same thing!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Initiating controlled infection."
4, 63, "Zoidberg", "I'm no doctor, but this machine guy could use a lozenge."
4, 63, "Amy", "Aw, pooh! We're even younger!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Day-umn! The bacteria pigged-out on the tar and now they're getting freaky-deaky, spreading Chronitons throughout our systems. We're getting younger by the minute!"
4, 63, "Amy", "Yikes!"
4, 63, "Zoidberg", "What? I'm going to revert through all my larval stages?"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Word! We'll all keep getting younger and younger until we suffer a fate worse than death"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "I've got to stop this reverse-aging before we all shrivel up and suffer the agony of un-birth. Think, you disco duck, think!"
4, 63, "Amy", "What's that squirmal under your shirt?"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Get off me, you parasitic lamprey!"
4, 63, "Zoidberg", "Oh, sure, like you need all your blood."
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Would you all chill! I can't think with you kids cramping my style! Oh, I need a babysitter."
4, 63, "Leela", "OK, quiet time. I know, everyone pretend a goblin ate your tongue and I'll read you a story."
4, 63, "Zoidberg", "I can't see from down here, I can't."
4, 63, "Leela", "There. Today's story is from New Teen magazine. What would you rather hear about? Four-legged Chachi or tentacled Chachi?"
4, 63, "Fry", "I wanna hear a space story!"
4, 63, "Leela", "It's kind of a baby book. But OK. Let's see. Snow White Dwarf And The Seven Red Dwarves, Charlotte's Tholian Web, The Fountain Of Aging."
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "The Fountain of Aging? Hmm. It is just a legend. Still, they called the Tooth Fairy a legend and now he's head of the FBI."
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Sup? Kids ready?"
4, 63, "Fry", "Professy's back!  Ew! You smell like smoking!  And drinking."
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "I had a few beers but I'm cool to drive."
4, 63, "Leela", "I wish I could come with you to say goodbye, before you all turn back in to grown-ups but I'm grounded for knocking the school over."
4, 63, "Munda", "Who cares, Leela? It was just a public school. Now go with your friends, please."
4, 63, "Leela", "No! A grounded teenager must be confined to her room!"
4, 63, "Leela", "Until she sneaks out!"
4, 63, "Bender", "When I grow up, I wanna be a steam shovel!"
4, 63, "Leela", "According to this, the Fountain is located in the darkest, most ancient region of space, just past Teddy Bear Junction."
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Teddy Bear Junction"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "This solar system is, like, way old."
4, 63, "Leela", "Look how high the asteroid belt is pulled up on that planet."
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Newsflash! Everything's getting older the closer we get to that ancient, burnt-out sun."
4, 63, "Leela", "Dude, the Fountain of Aging must be on the sun itself."
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Shut up! I was gonna say that!"
4, 63, "Leela", "We've got to hurry. The kids have only one change of pants!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "We gotta be real, real careful to stay in just long enough to make us our right ages again.   Zoidberg! Get out of there!"
4, 63, "Zoidberg", "The current! It's too much, already! Help!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Jeepers!"
4, 63, "Leela", "Zoidberg is dead!"
4, 63, "Zoidberg", "No! Zoidberg's brother is dead!  Funny story"
4, 63, "Sibling #1", "He always had to be the centre of attention!"
4, 63, "Sibling #2", "Let him go!"
4, 63, "Leela", "Oh, no!  Quick! Get them into the fountain!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Thanks for the help, Weewa. Once we're gwown up, you can go back to your famiwy. We'wl never bother you again."
4, 63, "Leela", "Well, you could bother me a little."
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "It's working! Hooray!  I can't hold on!"
4, 63, "Leela", "I'm coming in after you!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "No, Leela! You can't give up your childhood! You'll never have another chance at it!"
4, 63, "Fry", "We did it! We're the right ages again!"
4, 63, "Leela", "I think I might be a couple years younger."
4, 63, "Amy", "Oh, me too!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Help! I'm still in mid-peril, you clods!"
4, 63, "Leela", "He's too far out! We can't reach him!"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "With my last breath I curse Zoidberg!  Pazuzu! Oh, you came back to me!"
4, 63, "Hermes", "Are you back to your original age, Professor?"
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "Even older! Huzzah!"
4, 63, "Fry", "I'm sorry you had to give up being a kid, Leela."
4, 63, "Leela", "Well, I guess every adult wants to be a kid again sometimes. But I worked hard to be the person I am."
4, 63, "Fry", "The fabulous person!"
4, 63, "Leela", "With friends like you guys--"
4, 63, "Fry", "Fabulous friends!"
4, 63, "Leela", "And I'm really happy I have that life back."
4, 63, "Farnsworth", "And you, my faithful fiend! How can I ever repay you?"
4, 63, "Pazuzu", "And zat, little one, is how Papa gained his freedom. Now, bonne nuit, bonne nuit to you all!"
4, 64, "Fry", "Delivery boy Philip J. Fry, reporting for duty."
4, 64, "Zoidberg", "Dr. Zoidberg, soaking in brine."
4, 64, "Fry", "What is the meaning of this? We've got a delivery, people. Let's move! Let's move!  Amy? Mission profile?  Interesting, interesting. Dr. Zoidberg, mission bag?"
4, 64, "Zoidberg", "Packed and ready, sir."
4, 64, "Fry", "What's this? This is the same toy surprise I got last time!  I can't work under these conditions. And without me there is no mission. I am the mission!"
4, 64, "Leela", "We're back from the mission!"
4, 64, "Fry", "Wh-What? You went without me?"
4, 64, "Bender", "You were looking up curse words in the dictionary. It seemed like a better use of your time."
4, 64, "Fry", "But-- But I'm the delivery boy."
4, 64, "Leela", "Don't worry. Everything went fine."
4, 64, "Bender", "Better than usual!"
4, 64, "Leela", "We got medals! Good work, team! We really pulled together on this one."
4, 64, "Zoidberg", "They got medals."
4, 64, "Fry", "I'm real sorry I missed the mission. I wasn't there and you might have needed me."
4, 64, "Bender", "Nope."
4, 64, "Fry", "But if I'd been there I--"
4, 64, "Bender", "Nope."
4, 64, "Fry", "Look--"
4, 64, "Bender", "Nope."
4, 64, "Fry", "Bender's great--"
4, 64, "Bender", "Nope!"
4, 64, "Fry", "Listen, Leela, let me make it up by taking you out to dinner tonight."
4, 64, "Leela", "Nope.  I've got a date with Chaz."
4, 64, "Fry", "Chaz?"
4, 64, "Leela", "I met him at that charity cock fight last week. He's the mayor's aide."
4, 64, "Bender", "Ooh! You go, mutant girl!"
4, 64, "Leela", "I do go! He's a very important man."
4, 64, "Fry", "So? I'm just as important as him.  It's just that, the kind of importance I have ... it doesn't matter if I  don't do it."
4, 64, "Fry", "I'm nobody. There are guys in the background of Mary Worth comics who are more important than me."
4, 64, "Bender", "Ah, buck up, meatloaf. Bender'll take you out tonight and cheer you up. What do you wanna do? And I mean anything. You have the power! Name it and I'm there. You the man!"
4, 64, "Fry", "Um, OK. Let's go bowling."
4, 64, "Bender", "Nah."
4, 64, "Elzar", "Table for two? Step right this way."
4, 64, "Chaz", "I'm afraid we don't have a reservation but, uh, as you can see ...  ... I'm the mayor's aide. Table for two, please."
4, 64, "Elzar", "OK then."
4, 64, "Elzar", "Bam!"
4, 64, "Chaz", "It's OK, my man. I got you covered on your next health inspection."
4, 64, "Elzar", "I really appreciate that, mister mayor's aide.  Here you go. Compliments of the house."
4, 64, "Leela", "Wow! Free bread at a restaurant? Is there anything you can't do?"
4, 64, "Chaz", "I can't fail the mayor. Not ever."
4, 64, "Fry", "Oh, jeez! Better not let Leela see me."
4, 64, "Leela", "Hey, I hear Fry.  Boy, am I glad you're here."
4, 64, "Fry", "You are? So things aren't working out with whatshisname?"
4, 64, "Leela", "Actually ... they are! Confidentially, I might not make it back to my apartment tonight! Could you walk Nibbler for me?"
4, 64, "Fry", "Um ... uh..."
4, 64, "Leela", "And bring a baggy in case he drops a steamer.  Have a great night!"
4, 64, "Fry", "Oh, no! Please! No!  Perfect!"
4, 64, "Smitty", "Whoa! Smells like a 289 in progress."
4, 64, "URL", "Failure to scoop. Aw, yeah!"
4, 64, "Fry", "Wait! I'm trying. It weighs as much as a thousand suns."
4, 64, "Chaz", "Don't worry, Fry. I'll pull some strings -- see if I can't get you tried as a juvenile."
4, 64, "Leela", "Oh, Chaz!"
4, 64, "Fry", "I'm as worthless as this trash can."
4, 64, "Trash Can", "You think I'm as worthless as you? Try catching garbage in your head and raising six kids, you dumb townie!"
4, 64, "Fry", "Oh, Nibbler, at least I'm important to you. Even if it's only 'cause I clean up you poop."
4, 64, "Nibbler", "The poop eradication is but one aspect of your importance."
4, 64, "Fry", "D-D-Did you just talk?"
4, 64, "Nibbler", "Indeed. And I have other amazing powers as well."
4, 64, "Fry", "Like what?"
4, 64, "Fry", "Are you my mommy?"
4, 64, "Nibbler", "Negative."
4, 64, "Fiona", "Welcome, Lord Nibbler."
4, 64, "Nibbler", "Welcome acknowledged. I bring with me ... the Mighty One."
4, 64, "Fry", "Eh?"
4, 64, "Ken", "At last, our centuries upon centuries of waiting have achieved fruition."
4, 64, "Fry", "Aw! Aren't you a fuzzy wittle guy?"
4, 64, "Ken", "Stop that! Uh, please. Your Mightiness--"
4, 64, "Fry", "Mightiness? Are you off your nut? I just got kidnapped by a bunch of guinea pigs."
4, 64, "Ken", "Does he not know?"
4, 64, "Nibbler", "He does not know."
4, 64, "Fiona", "He knows not?"
4, 64, "Nibbler", "Knows not does he."
4, 64, "Nibblonian", "Not he know--"
4, 64, "Ken", "Enough! Fry, it is my duty to inform you that the fate of humanity, the fate of our race, indeed the fate of all that exists and ever will exist rests with you. You are the single most important person in the universe."
4, 64, "Fry", "Oh, snap!"
4, 64, "Nibbler", "On this auspicious occasion, let the horn of eternity cut a thunderous blast."
4, 64, "Fiona", "The Feast of a Thousand Beasts is begun."
4, 64, "Nibblonian", "You gonna eat that?"
4, 64, "Fry", "Maybe later."
4, 64, "Ken", "The time has come to discuss matters of the gravest importance."
4, 64, "Nibbler", "Fry, do you remember some months ago when the Earth was attacked by flying brains?"
4, 64, "Fry", "Hmm. I remember the square-dancing stomachs. Although that might have been a Mylanta commercial. Wait! The brains! I do remember! But no one else does. They said I was crazy."
4, 64, "Ken", "On the contrary. You remember because you were the only one immune to the Brains' mental attack."
4, 64, "Fry", "Because I'm so smart?"
4, 64, "Ken", "Oh, my. Anyway, your immunity is due to the fact that you lack the delta brainwave.  It's a genetic abnormality which resulted when you went back in time and performed certain actions which made you your own grandfather."
4, 64, "Fry", "I did do the nasty in the past-y!"
4, 64, "Nibbler", "Verily. And that past nastification is what shields you from the brains. You are the last hope of the universe."
4, 64, "Fry", "So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?"
4, 64, "Ken", "Yes. Except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock."
4, 64, "Nibbler", "For a thousand years, the evil Brains have been constructing the Infosphere, a giant memory bank twice the size of three ordinary memory banks."
4, 64, "Fry", "What's so evil about that?"
4, 64, "Fiona", "They plan to collect all the information in the universe and store it in the sphere."
4, 64, "Fry", "So they're trying to learn things?"
4, 64, "Fiona", "Right."
4, 64, "Fry", "Those bastards!"
4, 64, "Nibbler", "Being Brains, they feel compelled to know everything. And soon they will."
4, 64, "Fry", "I'm as mad as I've ever been."
4, 64, "Ken", "Once their task is complete, they will ensure that no new information arises in the only way possible"
4, 64, "Fry", "Now it's personal."
4, 64, "Fiona", "Your mission is to infiltrate the Infosphere and plant this quantum-interface bomb, blasting them into an alternate universe from which there is no return."
4, 64, "Nibbler", "Then outrun the blast on this Scooty-Puff Jr."
4, 64, "Fry", "OK, let's go through this once more--"
4, 64, "Fry", "Brains!"
4, 64, "Ken", "Fear not, Mighty One. Your missing brainwave makes you invisible to them, so long as you avoid intense thinking."
4, 64, "Fry", "Sorry, what? I wasn't paying attention."
4, 64, "Ken", "That is most wise."
4, 64, "Fry", "Who?"
4, 64, "Ken", "In a few seconds, the Brain will finish scanning the last bits of information in the universe."
4, 64, "Infosphere", "Beavers mate for life; 11 greater than 4; for quality carpets, visit Kaplan's carpet warehouse."
4, 64, "Ken", "Now the Infosphere will open its protective crust so as to scan itself, completing its thousand year task."
4, 64, "Fiona", "This is your one chance to enter the sphere. Scoot! Scoot now!"
4, 64, "Fry", "I'm at the input console. I'm a little nervous and I've got brain in my buttcrack."
4, 64, "Nibbler", "Roger."
4, 64, "Ken", "Once you press the detonator, you will have 60 seconds for an exciting escape."
4, 64, "Fry", "Hey, wait. This brain knows everything about everything, right?"
4, 64, "Ken", "It will soon. That's why you're supposed to be setting off a bomb."
4, 64, "Fry", "Yeah, yeah. But I can't pass up a chance to learn the answers to the greatest questions of all time.  Is it true that postage stamp glue is made of--"
4, 64, "Huge Brain", "Correct. Toad mucus."
4, 64, "Ken", "There's no time for this. Activate the bomb."
4, 64, "Fry", "Wait, wait, wait.  What really killed the dinosaurs?"
4, 64, "Huge Brain", "Me!"
4, 64, "Computer Voice", "Unauthorized data access."
4, 64, "Fry", "Uh-oh!"
4, 64, "Big Brain", "Detecting trace amounts of mental activity. Possibly a dead weasel or a cartoon viewer."
4, 64, "Fry", "Ew! Gross. Cut it out!"
4, 64, "Brain #1", "Odd. He is immune to our psionic attack."
4, 64, "Brain #2", "Impossible! We're an ambitious young squad with everything to prove."
4, 64, "Big Brain", "It appears we are in the presence of the fabled one. But without his Scooty-Puff Jr., he cannot escape.  Huh?"
4, 64, "Brain #2", "A quantum-interface bomb? Are you insane in the membrane?"
4, 64, "Fry", "You got it, poindexter!"
4, 64, "Brain #1", "Oh, not good!"
4, 64, "Computer Voice", "Detonation in T-60 Earth seconds."
4, 64, "Brain #3", "You fool! You'll be transported to the other universe with us. Trapped there for all eternity."
4, 64, "Brain #1", "And we'll form a tightly-knit clique that you won't be part of!"
4, 64, "Fry", "Well at least I did one important thing with my life"
4, 64, "Nibbler", "Yay!"
4, 64, "Ken", "Exactly!"
4, 64, "Big Brain", "The Nibblonians? Good? Ha! During your last moments in this universe perhaps you should query our database concerning the night of December 31st, 1999."
4, 64, "Fry", "The day I got frozen? What about it?"
4, 64, "Nibbler", "No! Don't ask about that! It-It would be, uh ... boring!"
4, 64, "Fry", "Ah, forget it then."
4, 64, "Big Brain", "Query!"
4, 64, "Fry", "OK! Sheesh! What happened to me, Philip J. Fry, on the night of December 31st, 1999?"
4, 64, "Huge Brain", "Clarification request"
4, 64, "Big Brain", "Earth, you fat idiot! Hurry up!"
4, 64, "Fry", "Hello? Pizza delivery for ...  ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud!"
4, 64, "Fry", "Eurgh! I can't believe how fat I look!  Aw, Nibbler's there. Wait! What?"
4, 64, "Fry", "What the--"
4, 64, "Fry", "I-- I don't understand. You made me go in the freezer tube?"
4, 64, "Computer Voice", "Detonation in T-15 seconds."
4, 64, "Fry", "You little runts froze me! You took away my life!"
4, 64, "Nibbler", "We can explain!"
4, 64, "Fry", "No, you can't. Shut your adorable trap!"
4, 64, "Nibbler", "We had no choice. You were the only one who could help us. What is one life weighed against the entire universe?"
4, 64, "Fry", "But it was my life."
4, 64, "Computer Voice", "Detonation in two, one. Will the owner of a white Pontiac Firebird-- Oh, never mind. Zero!"
4, 64, "Big Brain", "Well, here we are. Trapped for eternity."
4, 64, "Brain #2", "We could sing American Pie."
4, 64, "Fry", "Go ahead. I deserve it. I wish those stupid racoons had never brought me to the future."
4, 64, "Huge Brain", "I have shocking data relevant to this conversation."
4, 64, "Big Brain", "We don't care, you dope! We're in another universe. You're not in charge anymore."
4, 64, "Huge Brain", "It is possible for the Philip Fry to resume his life on December 31st, 1999."
4, 64, "Fry", "Really? I can go back in time?"
4, 64, "Huge Brain", "There is a nexus point between universes at the space-time where you entered the cryogenic tube. You and only you can return there."
4, 64, "Big Brain", "Interesting. You could stop the Nibblonian from pushing you into the cryogenic tube."
4, 64, "Fry", "That is interesting. Why?"
4, 64, "Big Brain", "It would be as if you never came to the future. You will have your life back and we will succeed in our plan to understand and destroy the universe."
4, 64, "Fry", "Everybody wins!"
4, 64, "Brain #2", "The human will be returned to the past!"
4, 64, "Narrator", "Meanwhile."
4, 64, "Leela", "I love rocket skating! But the wait is always so long. Poor Fry once stood in line for six hours just to get me a ticket."
4, 64, "Chaz", "Six hours? Pft! Sounds like a real nobody! But now it's time for somebody and some chick he's with to go skating."
4, 64, "Leela", "You reserved the whole rink?"
4, 64, "Chaz", "Yup. Buzzed ahead, let 'em know whose aide was coming by. The mayor's, that's whose."
4, 64, "Leela", "Oh, Chaz!"
4, 64, "Sally", "Mr. Vogel, I thought we was going skating."
4, 64, "Vogel", "No, we're not important enough. Everybody just hold hands until the bus driver comes back from his haircut."
4, 64, "Leela", "Aw, let's let those kids skate with us."
4, 64, "Chaz", "What? Seriously? I'm trying to impress you with my clout here."
4, 64, "Leela", "I know, and it's working. But think how much skating would mean to those kids."
4, 64, "Nina", "We came here instead of eating today."
4, 64, "Leela", "This may be their only chance to skate in their whole lives. Who are we to say they can't?"
4, 64, "Chaz", "The mayor's aide, and his badge.  Beat it, kids! Come back when you got connections!"
4, 64, "Vogel", "Alright, little ones, back to the orphanarium. You can slide around the gym in your socks."
4, 64, "Sally", "What socks?"
4, 64, "Chaz", "So am I gonna get lucky tonight or what?"
4, 64, "Fry", "I hope your calculations are correct."
4, 64, "Big Brain", "Our calculations are always correct. For we are gigantic brains."
4, 64, "Brain #2", "Initiate space-time transfer."
4, 64, "Nibbler", "I hereby place an order for one cheese pizza."
4, 64, "Panucci", "One pie, nothing good on it. Name?"
4, 64, "Nibbler", "I-period-C-period-Wiener."
4, 64, "Panucci", "Uh, talk a little louder. It sounds like you got some kind of tiny head on you or something."
4, 64, "Fry", "Hello? Pizza delivery for, uh ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud!"
4, 64, "Fry", "Gotcha!"
4, 64, "Nibbler", "I don't understand."
4, 64, "Fry", "Yes, you do! You came back in time to knock me into that freezer and now I came back in time to stop you."
4, 64, "Nibbler", "I did not come back in time. My people lack that ability."
4, 64, "Fry", "But ... I know you in the future. I-I cleaned your poop."
4, 64, "Nibbler", "Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. You will meet me when I'm a thousand years older."
4, 64, "Fry", "Not if you don't freeze me."
4, 64, "Nibbler", "Please. Our saviours foresee that in a thousand years, for one moment, the fate of the universe will depend on you. Since you will not live that long I must freeze you now."
4, 64, "Fry", "Well, why couldn't you just ask me?"
4, 64, "Nibbler", "We were afraid you would refuse."
4, 64, "Fry", "Of course not. I love the future."
4, 64, "Nibbler", "Then why are you choking me right now?"
4, 64, "Fry", "Because I don't like being used."
4, 64, "Nibbler", "Well now it's your choice. Is there nothing in the future worth saving?"
4, 64, "Fry", "Hm. Leela. But she doesn't think much of me."
4, 64, "Nibbler", "Ah, she must be The Other."
4, 64, "Fry", "What?"
4, 64, "Nibbler", "You must not give up on her. I am stationed on a distant world known as Vergon 6. But, if you return to the future, I will transfer to Earth to give you what help I can."
4, 64, "Crowd", "Ten, nine, eight, seven..."
4, 64, "Fry", "You really think I would have had a chance with Leela?"
4, 64, "Nibbler", "You must choose"
4, 64, "Crowd", "One."
4, 64, "Fry", "Yes! Here I come, future! Oh, no! Wait! I'm gonna get trapped in the Infosphere again! Just remember that Scooty-Puff Jr. sucks."
4, 64, "Nibbler", "In a thousand years, I'll get right on it."
4, 64, "Narrator", "And so, a thousand years later, Fry once again infiltrated the Infosphere and set off his amazing bomb. Only this time..."
4, 64, "Nibbler", "Thank you for saving the universe, Fry.  Here."
4, 64, "Fry", "Whoa, thanks! If you ever need a saviour again, just ask."
4, 64, "Nibbler", "Oh, we will. We will."
4, 64, "Fry", "Man, I can't wait to tell everyone what happened."
4, 64, "Nibbler", "Uh, yes. Incidentally, I need to remain undercover so I'm blanking your memory."
4, 64, "Fry", "Huh. Did everything just taste purple for a second? Oh, well. Let's go home, you dumb poop machine."
4, 64, "Leela", "Bender, would you do the honours?"
4, 64, "Bender", "With gusto."
4, 64, "Fry", "Hey, Leela. I guess I got this for you."
4, 64, "Leela", "Oh. Thank you. You know what, Fry? I don't care if you're not the most important person in the universe. It really makes me happy to see you right now."
4, 64, "Fry", "Then I am the most important person in the universe."
4, 64, "Fry", "Yes!"
4, 65, "Shatner", "Shatner's log, airdate ... unknown."
4, 65, "Shatner", "The impossible has happened. It would take days to recount the events I have witnessed. So, settle in. It all began--"
4, 65, "Zapp", "Quiet, you! This court martial is now in session. The honourably sexy Zapp Brannigan residing. Bring in the accused."
4, 65, "Takei", "Oh, my!"
4, 65, "Zapp", "Philip J. Fry, you stand accused of travelling to the forbidden planet, Omega 3, a crime punishable by 12 concurrent death sentences. Do you understand the charges?"
4, 65, "Kif", "One beep for ""yes"", two beeps for ""no""."
4, 65, "Zapp", """Yes"". So noted. Do you plead guilty?  Double ""yes"". Guilty! I will now carry out the punishment. Kif, my gun."
4, 65, "Leela", "Wait! He pled ""not guilty""."
4, 65, "Zapp", "Order!  Order in the court! Very well then, Mr. Fry. Please recount the events that led you to be guilty."
4, 65, "Leela", "The Professor said he was taking a brief nap, so we only have time for six movies."
4, 65, "Bender", "Let's take these six Jim Carrey movies and record over them."
4, 65, "Fry", "You know what movies average out to be really good? The first six Star Trek movies!"
4, 65, "Clerk", "Everybody hit the deck!"
4, 65, "Leela", "Sh! Those words are forbidden!"
4, 65, "Fry", "What words? Star Trek?"
4, 65, "Leela", "Sh!"
4, 65, "Zoidberg", "Shut your gills!"
4, 65, "Bender", "That sound! It's patrol car 718! Hide him!"
4, 65, "Zapp", "The court is intrigued. Perhaps we could hear more about these forbidden words from someone with a sexily seductive voice."
4, 65, "Takei", "With pleasure. You see, the show was banned after the Star Trek wars."
4, 65, "Zapp", "You mean the vast migration of Star Wars fans?"
4, 65, "Nichols", "No, that was the Star Wars trek.  By the 23rd century, Star Trek fandom had evolved from a loose association of nerds with skin problems into a full-blown religion."
4, 65, "Priest", "And Scotty beamed them to the Klingon ship where they would be no Tribble at all."
4, 65, "Congregation", "All power to the engines."
4, 65, "Nichols", "As country after country fell under its influence, world leaders became threatened by the movements power.  And so the Trekkies were executed in the manner most befitting virgins."
4, 65, "Man", "He's dead, Jim!  He's dead, Jim!  He's dead, Jim!"
4, 65, "Nichols", "Finally, the sacred texts were banned."
4, 65, "Takei", "The last copies of the 79 episodes and six movies were dumped on the forbidden world, Omega 3, along with that blooper reel where the door doesn't close all the way."
4, 65, "Nimoy", "Thus, Star Trek was forever scoured from human memory."
4, 65, "Bender", "Another classic science-fiction show cancelled before its time."
4, 65, "Zapp", "I've never heard of such a brutal and shocking injustice that I cared so little about. Next witness."
4, 65, "Kif", "Bender the robot, please take the stand."
4, 65, "Fry", "She's all yours, buddy!"
4, 65, "Bender", "I'd only met the defendant, Fry, once, but I knew he was up to no good."
4, 65, "Zapp", "Please use the beeps."
4, 65, "Fry", "Mr. Nimoy, I came as soon as I heard what happened centuries ago. I can't believe your show was banned."
4, 65, "Nimoy", "I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about."
4, 65, "Fry", "You know. 1966? 79 episodes, about 30 good ones."
4, 65, "Nimoy", "Oh, really, I've done too many things to remember one particular TV series. But if-if you want to discuss my books of poetry--"
4, 65, "Fry", "Come on! Remember that episode where you got high on spores and smacked Kirk around?"
4, 65, "Nimoy", "No. Perhaps you're thinking of my one man show about Vincent van Spock-- Uh, uh, I mean van Gogh! Damn!"
4, 65, "Fry", "Aha! You can't escape it!"
4, 65, "Nimoy", "Oh, you're right, I can't."
4, 65, "Fry", "Uh, jeez, don't get upset. I mean, OK, I outwitted you, but--"
4, 65, "Nimoy", "No, it's my fellow cast members. 300 years ago they left Earth behind."
4, 65, "Shatner", "This planet doesn't appreciate us anymore, Leonard."
4, 65, "Nimoy", "Bill, you are, and always shall be, my friend. But I just signed a six-month lease on my apartment. I can't walk away from a commitment like that."
4, 65, "Shatner", "Very well, my friend."
4, 65, "Nimoy", "Why did the world turn it's back on our obvious greatness?"
4, 65, "Fry", "I'm literally angry with rage! Your co-stars may be gone but we can still get those episode tapes back for the whole world to see. Come on!"
4, 65, "Nimoy", "Oh!"
4, 65, "Frakes", "Yes! Front row!"
4, 65, "Leela", "You can't go to Omega 3; it's forbidden! I forbid you!"
4, 65, "Fry", "But we have to! The world needs Star Trek to give people hope for the future."
4, 65, "Leela", "But it's set 800 years in the past!"
4, 65, "Bender", "Yeah, why is this so important to you?"
4, 65, "Fry", "'Cause it-it taught me so much. Like how you should accept people, whether they be black, white, Klingon or even female. But most importantly, when I didn't have any friends, it made me feel like maybe I did."
4, 65, "Leela", "Well, that is touchingly pathetic. I guess I can't let you go alone."
4, 65, "Bender", "I'll go too, with Leonard's permission, of course."
4, 65, "Leela", "We're entering the Omega system."
4, 65, "Computer Voice", "Warning"
4, 65, "Bender", "Forbidden shmer-shmidden! What are they gonna do, write a letter?  Ooh, I'm so scared!"
4, 65, "Leela", "I've lost control of the ship!"
4, 65, "Fry", "Oh, dip!"
4, 65, "Nimoy", "Dip, indeed!"
4, 65, "Fry", "It's all stuff from that forbidden show."
4, 65, "Nimoy", "So many cardboard sets, so many memories. If only the others--"
4, 65, "Shatner", "I guess that's my cue."
4, 65, "Nimoy", "Bill!"
4, 65, "Shatner", "L-Dog!"
4, 65, "Nimoy", "Hey! This is wonderful!"
4, 65, "Shatner", "Oh, man."
4, 65, "Nimoy", "I feel like hugging you."
4, 65, "Shatner", "Well I would except you have no body!  And we're both men."
4, 65, "Nimoy", "Nichelle! George! Walter! DeForest!  Welshie!"
4, 65, "Fry", "Welshie?"
4, 65, "Nichols", "We did some musical reunion specials in the 2200's but the guy who played Scotty had trouble yodelling."
4, 65, "Takei", "Ever since then, Welshie has been a welcome participant in our escapades."
4, 65, "Fry", "I can't believe it! How'd you all end up here?"
4, 65, "Shatner", "We were on our way to Welshie's cousin's house to stay in the guest room when our ship was pulled down to this planet and crashed, just like yours."
4, 65, "Koenig", "When we woke up, we had these bodies."
4, 65, "Fry", "Say it in Russian!"
4, 65, "Koenig", "Ven vee voke up vee had these wodies."
4, 65, "Fry", "Now say ""nuclear wessels""!"
4, 65, "Koenig", "No!"
4, 65, "Takei", "You'll love it here. Everything is provided for us, and we never age. Check out these abs!"
4, 65, "Bender", "Yowza!"
4, 65, "Leela", "But who's doing all this for you?"
4, 65, "Shatner", "You know, we never thought about it. We're famous celebrities -- we're used to this sort of treatment."
4, 65, "Melllvar", "It is I!"
4, 65, "Bender", "Whoa! What a cheesy effect!"
4, 65, "Melllvar", "I am not an effect! You doubt my power?"
4, 65, "Bender", "I do."
4, 65, "Welshie", "Aye!"
4, 65, "Fry", "Welshie!"
4, 65, "Zapp", "This court will now hear some very sensual testimony from this court's ex-lover, Turanga Leela."
4, 65, "Leela", "Go  yourself."
4, 65, "Melllvar", "Behold another power, different from the one you saw earlier."
4, 65, "Nimoy", "Hey, a body! Buff, tan. Yeah, this is mine, alright!"
4, 65, "Fry", "Alright, you gas, what's the deal?"
4, 65, "Melllvar", "Centuries ago, the videotaped adventures of the Enterprise crew rained down upon my planet. Over and over, I watched them. Especially the five with the energy beings. I am Melllvar! Seer of the tapes, knower of the episodes! Tremble before my encyclopaedic knowledge of Star Trek!"
4, 65, "Fry", "Tremble? I laugh. Nobody knows more about Star Trek than me!"
4, 65, "Melllvar", "I beg to differ.  Long have I waited for the one who played Spock. At last, we can begin."
4, 65, "Fry", "Cool! A Star Trek convention!"
4, 65, "Nimoy", "Uh, Melllvar, can you give us some idea of how long this is going to last?"
4, 65, "Melllvar", "Until time stops."
4, 65, "Leela", "What?"
4, 65, "Shatner", "He can't do this!"
4, 65, "Nimoy", "You can't be serious!"
4, 65, "Melllvar", "Now, we have a full schedule of events--"
4, 65, "Bender", "Uh, can people who hate Star Trek leave?"
4, 65, "Koenig", "Good question!"
4, 65, "Melllvar", "No, you have to stay even longer."
4, 65, "Melllvar", "Um, uh, sign it to Melllvar. ""Melllvar"" has three ""L's""."
4, 65, "Takei", "I think I've done enough conventions to know how to spell ""Melllvar""."
4, 65, "Bender", "Say ""nerd""!"
4, 65, "All", "Nerd!"
4, 65, "Shatner", "I'm Slim Shady,Yes, I'm the real Shady,All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating,So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,Please stand up,Please stand up."
4, 65, "Koenig", "How can you do a spoken-word version of a rap song?"
4, 65, "Melllvar", "He found a way."
4, 65, "Leela", "For one hundred quatloos"
4, 65, "Shatner", "Khaaan!"
4, 65, "Fry", "Uh ... Khan?"
4, 65, "Leela", "Correct."
4, 65, "Melllvar", "My button has broken. The trivia contest has ended. I-I now have a surprise. You will perform a fan script, written by the ultimate Trek fan."
4, 65, "Fry", "You have my fan script?"
4, 65, "Melllvar", "I meant me! Melllvar is the ultimate fan!"
4, 65, "Fry", "Oh, I was confused because the scoreboard says something different."
4, 65, "Melllvar", "Trivia contest over! Take your scripts!  We have limited rehearsal time. Now, I didn't make enough copies of the script, so George and Walter will have to share."
4, 65, "Leela", "Uh, you probably don't want us to see you rehearsing, or it'll give away the ending."
4, 65, "Melllvar", "That's right! The ending must not be ruined."
4, 65, "Leela", "We'll go wait in the ship."
4, 65, "Melllvar", "OK."
4, 65, "Fry", "Not till I get my 600 quatloos!"
4, 65, "Fry", "This is wrong. We shouldn't have abandoned them there."
4, 65, "Bender", "I dunno, I'm feeling pretty good about it."
4, 65, "Leela", "I didn't wanna leave them either, Fry, but what are we supposed to do?"
4, 65, "Fry", "Well, usually on the show someone would come up with a complicated plan then explain it with a simple analogy."
4, 65, "Leela", "Hmm. If we can re-route engine power through the primary weapons and reconfigure them to Melllvar's frequency, that should overload his electro-quantum structure."
4, 65, "Bender", "Like putting too much air in a balloon!"
4, 65, "Fry", "Of course! It's so simple!"
4, 65, "Shatner", "Alas, my ship, whom I love like a woman, is ... disabled.  Oh, Lord!"
4, 65, "Nimoy", "Fascinating, Captain, and logical too, that we need some help."
4, 65, "Takei", "Look, Captain, Melllvar will help us."
4, 65, "Koenig", "Keptin, I wope he will welp our ... vessel."
4, 65, "Melllvar", "Wessel!  You're not acting hard enough!"
4, 65, "Nimoy", "Melllvar, you have to respect your actors. When I directed Star Trek IV I got a magnificent performance out of Bill because I respected him so much."
4, 65, "Shatner", "And when I directed Star Trek V I got a magnificent performance out of me, because I respected me so much!"
4, 65, "Bender", "OK! I'm done re-kafoobling the energy motron ... or whatever."
4, 65, "Leela", "Fire!"
4, 65, "Nichols", "My, what a handsome energy creature you are. I love you.  Hey, you wrote it!"
4, 65, "Leela", "It's not working! He's drawing straight from our weapons."
4, 65, "Fry", "Like a balloon and ... something bad happens."
4, 65, "Bender", "Yup!"
4, 65, "Leela", "So, uh, how's rehearsal going?"
4, 65, "Melllvar", "Lousy. Here I've been admiring a bunch of actors while you, a crew of genuine space heroes, risked your lives to save them."
4, 65, "Nimoy", "Hey! We've done heroic things too."
4, 65, "Nichols", "Yeah! In the third season I kissed Shatner!"
4, 65, "Melllvar", "Silence! My whole world has turned upside-down. I have but one option."
4, 65, "Koenig", "Keep them and let us go?"
4, 65, "Melllvar", "No! To determine who is more worthy of my fanatical devotion I shall pit you together against each other in armed combat ... to the death!"
4, 65, "Bender", "Where'd you get an idiotic idea like that?"
4, 65, "Melllvar", "Episodes 19, 46, 56 and 77."
4, 65, "Fry", "Great list. Except, you forgot episode 66!"
4, 65, "Melllvar", "I was getting to that one!"
4, 65, "Zapp", "So Melllvar ordered a battle to the death. I assume no one survived."
4, 65, "Leela", "Can we get on with this? My foot's getting tired!"
4, 65, "Melllvar", "This will be your standard battle to the death. The only weapons"
4, 65, "Koenig", "I don't have much experience at fighting -- except with you guys."
4, 65, "Shatner", "I have an idea. Wasn't there an episode where I threw my shoe at the enemy?"
4, 65, "Nimoy", "You mean Doohan?"
4, 65, "Shatner", "Whoever it was, I did it like this."
4, 65, "Takei", "Ow!"
4, 65, "Shatner", "My foot's cold!"
4, 65, "Leela", "There. We can make these into spears."
4, 65, "Fry", "And we can tie these caterpillars together to make bow strings for bows and arrows."
4, 65, "Bender", "And we can use this machine gun to shoot them! Yee-haw!  That was fun!"
4, 65, "Nichols", "What if I distract them with my famous fan dance?"
4, 65, "Shatner", "Oh, that's good, good, good, good. And then, George, you give them a karate chop!"
4, 65, "Takei", "I find that offensive. Just because I'm of Japanese ancestry you assume I know karate. Have I ever led you to believe I've studied karate?"
4, 65, "Shatner", "Well, no, but you never talk about yourself."
4, 65, "Takei", "Maybe if you showed a little interest."
4, 65, "Fry", "Well, here goes nothing."
4, 65, "Nichols", "Hello, boys!"
4, 65, "Bender", "Whoa!"
4, 65, "Takei", "Hi-yah!"
4, 65, "Shatner", "There's no right way to hit a woman."
4, 65, "Leela", "Then do it the wrong way."
4, 65, "Shatner", "Fine. Yah!"
4, 65, "Leela", "Is that all you've got? Hi-yah!"
4, 65, "Shatner", "See you in h--"
4, 65, "Bender", "Come on, Walter!"
4, 65, "Nimoy", "Take that!"
4, 65, "Fry", "It hurts!"
4, 65, "Nimoy", "Let's see if this actually works!  Hm.  Ow! Ow! Ow!"
4, 65, "Koenig", "My face!"
4, 65, "Takei", "Ow! My face too!"
4, 65, "Shatner", "May I?  Oh!"
4, 65, "Melllvar", "Excellent! Excellent!"
4, 65, "Shatner", "Leela, please. This is exactly what Melllvar wants. We're just pawns in his diabolical game of checkers. Can't we resolve our differences some other way?"
4, 65, "Melllvar's Mother", "Melllvar! Dinner time!"
4, 65, "Melllvar", "Aw, but Mom, I'm playing with my collectables!"
4, 65, "Melllvar's Mother", "Now!"
4, 65, "Fry", "All this time we thought he was a powerful super-being, yet he was just a child."
4, 65, "Melllvar's Mother", "He's not a child, he's 34!"
4, 65, "Bender", "Alright, Koenig, I've wanted to do this for years!"
4, 65, "Fry", "Bender, wait! This is our chance to escape, before Melllvar comes back. But we all need to work together."
4, 65, "Shatner", "I love you so much!"
4, 65, "Nimoy", "Hello?"
4, 65, "Fry", "We've decided to work together."
4, 65, "Nimoy", "Uh, so did they."
4, 65, "Shatner", "Now, how do we escape?"
4, 65, "Leela", "We can't use our ship; we have life support but the engines are wrecked."
4, 65, "Takei", "Ironic, because our engines work but our life support systems don't."
4, 65, "Leela", "Hey, if your engines work--"
4, 65, "Takei", "And your life support systems work--"
4, 65, "Fry", "Stop! You're just goin' around in circles!  Think, Fry, think! Everyone's depending on you."
4, 65, "Leela", "We're too heavy. You guys need to lose some weight, fast!"
4, 65, "Fry", "Look, Leonard, we're light enough to keep the tapes! Isn't that great?"
4, 65, "Nimoy", "I'm living in a gefilte fish jar."
4, 65, "Fry", "We did it!"
4, 65, "Fry", "Melllvar's got a spaceship!"
4, 65, "Melllvar", "Yes, in mint condition. And you made me take it out of the package!"
4, 65, "Leela", "The Nimbus! We're saved!"
4, 65, "Zapp", "You're under arrest. Prepare to be boarded."
4, 65, "Zapp", "So I boarded you, eh? What happened next?"
4, 65, "Leela", "You started this stupid court martial. Now if you don't mind, we're still fighting Melllvar!"
4, 65, "Leela", "One more hit and we're done for!"
4, 65, "Takei", "Let's take 'em out with us. Do you guys have a self-destruct code? Like ""destruct sequence 1-A, 2-B, 3--"""
4, 65, "Bender", "Thanks a lot, Takei, now everybody knows!"
4, 65, "Melllvar", "If I can't have the original cast of Star Trek, no one will! Prepare to die!"
4, 65, "Fry", "Wait! If they mean that much to you, why do you wanna kill them?"
4, 65, "Melllvar", "Because I ... I ... I dunno what I'd do without them."
4, 65, "Fry", "Melllvar, you can't let a TV show be your whole life. You can do anything you want. Look at Walter Koenig"
4, 65, "Koenig", "Not just an actor, but a well-rounded person, with my own friends and credit cards and keys."
4, 65, "Melllvar", "Well, I guess I could move out of my parents' basement ... maybe get a temp job."
4, 65, "Fry", "Whoa, whoa! One step at a time."
4, 65, "Melllvar", "I thank you, Fry. You know, you and I are of a kind. In a different reality I could have called you ""friend""."
4, 65, "Fry", "Episode 10, Balance of Terror."
4, 65, "Melllvar", "More like episode nine, loser! In your face! Victory is mine!"
4, 65, "Shatner", "I wonder, my friends, was he really such an evil energy gas?"
4, 65, "Nichols", "He did give us eternal youth."
4, 65, "Koenig", "24-hour Laundromat."
4, 65, "Takei", "A full assortment of rum, both spiced and regular."
4, 65, "Nimoy", "Truly, it was a paradise."
4, 65, "Fry", "And all you had to put up with was one really annoying Star Trek fan."
4, 65, "Shatner", "Let's get the hell outta here!"
4, 66, "Bender", "A hush comes over the crowd. The only sound is Bender calling everyone else a jerk as he swings!  Oh, he slices! Into the water! Oh, man!   Boy, I tell you, buddy!"
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "Bad news, everyone. You're not good enough to go on your next mission."
4, 66, "Fry", "Hooray!"
4, 66, "Bender", "Not good enough!"
4, 66, "Leela", "Why? Says who?"
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "Because. And says me. It's an extremely dangerous mission that killed my last crew. And you're not nearly as good as them."
4, 66, "Fry", "Woo-hoo!"
4, 66, "Bender", "We live to suck another day!"
4, 66, "Leela", "We're just as good as any of those other crews you sent to their deaths. What's the mission?"
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "Collecting honey. Ordinary honey."
4, 66, "Leela", "That doesn't sound so dangerous."
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "This is no ordinary honey! It's produced by vicious space bees. A single sting of their hideous neuro-toxin can cause instant death."
4, 66, "Hermes", "And that's if you're not allergic. You don't wanna know what happens then. Oh, no, no. God, no!"
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "Your insides will boil out of your eye sockets like a science fair volcano."
4, 66, "Hermes", "I didn't want to know!"
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "These bees are larger than most Buicks and twice as ugly."
4, 66, "Fry", "Larger than an American sedan?  How big is the honeycomb?"
4, 66, "Hermes", "Honeycomb's big. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
4, 66, "Bender", "It's not small?"
4, 66, "Hermes", "No, no, no."
4, 66, "Leela", "It'll take more than deadly, deadly bees to keep us from doing our job. Come on, boys."
4, 66, "Fry", "But, Leela, we're no good."
4, 66, "Leela", "Listen, I'm scared too. But I'm more scared of disappointing myself."
4, 66, "Fry", "I'm not scared of that at all."
4, 66, "Leela", "Now, bees communicate by dancing."
4, 66, "Fry", "Like my parents! Oh, wait, that was hitting."
4, 66, "Leela", "So this language cartridge will let you distract them."
4, 66, "Bender", "Ah, good. I often have thoughts and feelings that can only be expressed through dance.   You stink. Bender's great. Deal with it."
4, 66, "Leela", "Bender, quick! Waggle something!"
4, 66, "Bender", "Uh ...  Hello, fellow bees. How's the abdomen? Swollen with nectar, I trust?"
4, 66, "Bee", "Duh!"
4, 66, "Fry", "Leela, let's turn back. There's absolutely no shame in wussing out."
4, 66, "Leela", "Relax. Everything'll be fine."
4, 66, "Fry", "Oh, my God! The old Planet Express ship."
4, 66, "Leela", "There's the black box."
4, 66, "Man", "Captain, the bees have us surrounded! Oh, the Professor was right. We're not as good as his old crew!"
4, 66, "Captain", "Well I aim to prove him wrong. It'll take more than a few deadly, deadly bees to--   Oh, Lord!"
4, 66, "Leela", "Uh, couldn't make that out. Too much static."
4, 66, "Bender", "Ew!"
4, 66, "Leela", "We found it! The honeycomb hideout."
4, 66, "Fry", "Hey, what's this goop?"
4, 66, "Leela", "Royal jelly. They feed it to the queen."
4, 66, "Fry", "Bees make honey and jelly? Huh. How come nothing humans make tastes good?  Help! I can't swim in jelly, as far as I know!"
4, 66, "Leela", "Look!  It's a baby queen! Aw, she's so cute! You adorable wittle, itty-bitty, fuzzy-wuzzy--"
4, 66, "Fry", "Leela! Stop bonding and let's go! I got jelly in my underpants!"
4, 66, "Leela", "I'm taking this bee with us. With a queen we can build a hive and make more honey ourselves. Let me just pack her a lunch and we'll go."
4, 66, "Bender", "Pick up the pace, lady! I'm sick of shaking my booty for these fat jerks.  I didn't mean you're all fat. Just fatso there."
4, 66, "Bee", "He insulted our fat queen."
4, 66, "Queen", "You try keeping your figure after 10,000 kids."
4, 66, "Leela", "This is where we distinguish ourselves from the last crew. Activate emergency high-speed self-contained escape pack crisis response unit. Quick!"
4, 66, "Leela", "Good luck, Bender!"
4, 66, "Bender", "I'm back, baby!"
4, 66, "Fry", "We made it! We're alive!"
4, 66, "Leela", "Burn on that, old crew! The only things they did better than us were suck and die."
4, 66, "Fry", "Leela, we got lucky this time. But you should be more careful. I don't want anything to happen to you."
4, 66, "Leela", "Thanks, but I can look out for myself. Frankly, I can smell danger a mile away."
4, 66, "Fry", "Look out!  You want her, you're gonna have to go through me!"
4, 66, "Leela", "You call that a wound? That's a boo-boo tops. But thanks for trying to save me, Fry.   Fry?!  He's... he's dead!"
4, 66, "Bender", "Who will make Bender waffles just the way he likes them now?"
4, 66, "Leela", "It was all my fault! He died because of me!"
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "No, no, no, no, no, no.   I'm lying to make her feel better!"
4, 66, "LaBarbara", "Husband, can't you go anywhere without lighting something up?"
4, 66, "Hermes", "It's an old Jamaican accounting tradition. We burn his timecard. That way his zombie doesn't come back looking for his final paycheck."
4, 66, "Amy", "He looks so natural. It's funny to think he's clammed full of sawdust and preservatives."
4, 66, "Zoidberg", "I only wish I could have removed the stinger."
4, 66, "Changstein el Gamahl", "I barely knew Philip. But, as a clergyman, I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him."
4, 66, "Hermes", "Soothe us with sweet lies."
4, 66, "Changstein el Gamahl", "It may comfort you to know Fry's death took only 15 seconds. Yet the pain was so intense that it felt to him like 15 years. And it goes without saying it caused him to empty his bowels.  We now commend Fry's body to the ages."
4, 66, "Amy", "He's walking on sunshine now."
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "This makes me the oldest member of my family."
4, 66, "Kug", "Him do good snu-snu."
4, 66, "Bender", "All those times I said ""Kill all humans,"" I'd always whisper ""except one"". Fry was that one.  And I never told him so!"
4, 66, "Terry", "Farewell, from the world of tomorrow!"
4, 66, "Leela", "They say a spoonful of space honey helps ease the pain.  Mmm... It's good.  I feel funny. Ha-ha funny!"
4, 66, "Fry", "Leela?"
4, 66, "Leela", "Fry? I thought you were dead."
4, 66, "Fry", "Nope, I'm better than ever. Before the accident I couldn't do this!"
4, 66, "Leela", "Impressive! But it does sorta support my you-are-dead theory."
4, 66, "Fry", "Then I'll prove I'm alive, by telling you something only I could know.  There's a surprise for you in my locker. I got it at a Swedish novelty shop before we left."
4, 66, "Leela", "It's too beautiful to open. Can I open it?"
4, 66, "Fry", "Sure. There's just one thing I want you to do."
4, 66, "Leela", "What?"
4, 66, "Fry", "I want you to wake up."
4, 66, "Leela", "Wake up? But I'm not--"
4, 66, "Leela", "In my dream Fry said he hid a gift for me in his locker. If it's true then he must still exist in some form."
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "Of course he still exists"
4, 66, "Leela", "Well, here goes."
4, 66, "Zoidberg", "Bupkis!"
4, 66, "Bender", "Well, I feel better now. Pawning all the stuff in Fry's locker helped give me closure."
4, 66, "Leela", "Was there anything in there that might have been a gift for me?"
4, 66, "Bender", "No. Nothing. Not at all. No way, José!  Here it is."
4, 66, "Leela", "You took this from Fry's locker?"
4, 66, "Bender", "Hey, the guy's dead! There's no law against grave robbing."
4, 66, "Leela", "That proves it. Fry is alive somewhere and he's reaching me in my dreams."
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "Bull pies!"
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "Lay down here and we'll do some tests. If Fry is out there then Leela's brain could be acting as a five-pound Ouija board."
4, 66, "Leela", "Is this some sort of brain scanner?"
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "Some sort, yes. In France it's called a guillotine."
4, 66, "Leela", "Professor! Can't you examine my brain without removing it?"
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "Yes, easily."
4, 66, "Bender", "Hey, what if Fry wasn't actually dead when we buried him? Y'know like Julia Roberts?"
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "Well, I suppose there's a slim--  I don't believe it!"
4, 66, "Leela", "What is it? Is Fry alive in some other dimension or something?"
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "No. According to this gizmometer, Fry is dead and nothing can bring him back. Remarkable!"
4, 66, "Leela", "But ... my dream. Your science can't unprove that! How could I have known the gift was in Fry's locker?"
4, 66, "Hermes", "Easy! He told you about it before he died and your grief-roasted mind blocked it out."
4, 66, "Leela", "Are you saying I'm going crazy?"
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "No, no! No one's saying that. But I'm certainly thinking it loudly."
4, 66, "Fry", "Hi, Leela! I'm just gonna keep talking, even if you can't hear me. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
4, 66, "Leela", "Shut up! I can hear you. The Professor says you're just a dream."
4, 66, "Fry", "Oh, yeah?  Could a dream take you dancing in a Venusian garden?"
4, 66, "Leela", "Well, yes, technically. But it's still very sweet of you."
4, 66, "Fry", "Then what if we shared a sleigh ride across the ice fields of Hyperion?"
4, 66, "Leela", "Oh, Fry! You must be alive; I've never been treated so romantically by my own imagination before."
4, 66, "Fry", "Here, take my jacket. You look a little cold."
4, 66, "Leela", "Thank you. It's all so beautiful. I forgot how many hundreds of degrees below zero it must be. I just wish I could convince the others you're alive."
4, 66, "Fry", "You can. All you have to do is wake up."
4, 66, "Leela", "No, no! Don't say that! This is real!"
4, 66, "Leela", "Not another dream!  Fry's jacket! The one he was buried in! My dream was real! He's alive!"
4, 66, "Petunia", "Quit your bragging! My boyfriend's alive too!  Not 'nymore!"
4, 66, "Bender", "That's better!"
4, 66, "Leela", "Fry's alive! I have proof!"
4, 66, "Amy", "No way!"
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "You lie!"
4, 66, "Bender", "You do not!"
4, 66, "Hermes", "I'm from Jamaica, the ""Show Me"" island. So show me you're blowing it out your fanny."
4, 66, "Leela", "But he gave me his jacket. Look."
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "That's not Fry's jacket. Fry's jacket is red. That's your jacket. An off-the-rack, lime green affair."
4, 66, "Leela", "But Fry-- His jacket-- And when I woke up it was on me."
4, 66, "Hermes", "You're under a lot of guilt stress, Leela. Here, work it off."
4, 66, "Leela", "I am not under stress, damnit!"
4, 66, "Amy", "Everything's going to be alright, Leela."
4, 66, "Leela", "What?"
4, 66, "Amy", "I said everything's going to be alright."
4, 66, "Leela", "Oh. Maybe I am freaking out a little."
4, 66, "Bender", "A little? You're screwier than my Aunt Rita. And she's a screw!"
4, 66, "Leela", "I need to calm down. I'd better take some more of that space honey."
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "You've been taking space honey? Be careful, you purple-haired imbecile!"
4, 66, "Zoidberg", "One spoonful calms you down. Two spoonfuls help you sleep. But three spoonfuls and you'll go into a sleep so deep you'll never wake up. Never!"
4, 66, "Hermes", "Never!"
4, 66, "Bender", "Never!"
4, 66, "Leela", "One spoonful to calm me down.  OK, I've got a pretty good calm going! Two spoonfuls to help me sleep.  Uh-oh, still awake. I guess one more spoonful couldn't hurt.  Oh, my gosh! I'd better get a sponge.  Fry?  Is that you? I don't need a sponge!"
4, 66, "Fry", "Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?"
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "Incredible! According to the gizmometer, Fry touched the royal jelly in the space hive, leaving an imprint of his DNA and brainwaves. Then, when it spilled on the couch, it recombined with trace amounts of Fry's hair and skin--"
4, 66, "Bender", "And blood! Don't forget about Fry's blood!"
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "Yes, Bender, thank you. In short, the various fluids Fry left in the couch caused the royal jelly to regenerate his entire being."
4, 66, "Fry", "Neat!"
4, 66, "Bender", "This is great! My buddy's alive and his credit cards are valid again.  Let's go get hammered!"
4, 66, "Zoidberg", "I should warn you, I'm a mean drunk."
4, 66, "Leela", "Fry, I'm so glad I didn't kill you."
4, 66, "Fry", "Me too."
4, 66, "Leela", "Feeling responsible for your death was driving me mad. But now everything is alright."
4, 66, "Fry", "Uh, not everything."
4, 66, "Leela", "What? What do you mean?"
4, 66, "Fry", "You have to wake up."
4, 66, "Leela", "Wake up? Oh, no! No! It can't be!"
4, 66, "Leela", "Pooh!"
4, 66, "Leela", "I'm cracking up. In my dreams I'm happy because Fry is alive. But when I'm awake, my mind plays tricks on me."
4, 66, "Hermes", "Oh, take it easy, Leela."
4, 66, "Amy", "In every life we have some trouble."
4, 66, "Bender", "But when you worry, you make it double."
4, 66, "Amy and Bender", "Don't worry! Bee happy!"
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "The landlord says your rent is late."
4, 66, "Hermes", "He might have to litigate."
4, 66, "Bender", "But don't worry!"
4, 66, "Bee", "Bee--"
4, 66, "Farnsworth", "Happy!"
4, 66, "Zoidberg", "Ain't got no cash,Ain't got no style,Ladies vomit when I smile,But does Zoidberg worry?Feh! You wish!"
4, 66, "Bee", "Bee--"
4, 66, "Zoidberg", "Happy!"
4, 66, "Hermes", "Don't worry now, Amy!"
4, 66, "Amy", "OK! I'm happy!"
4, 66, "Bender", "Take us home, Bender!  Don't worry!"
4, 66, "Bee", "Bee--"
4, 66, "Bender", "Happy!"
4, 66, "Leela", "Uh, were you just singing?"
4, 66, "Bender", "No, I was telling you not to worry. I'm not allowed to sing. Court order."
4, 66, "Leela", "I'll find Fry's coffin, get his corpse and keep it under my mattress to remind me that he's really dead. That'll prove I'm not insane."
4, 66, "Leela", "OK, it's just an ordinary coffin. Containing my ordinary dead friend, who I killed."
4, 66, "Leela", "What happened? Why am I in my apartment?"
4, 66, "Farnsworth, Zoidberg, Hermes, Amy and Bender", "You killed Fry! You killed Fry! You killed Fry ...!"
4, 66, "Leela", "Stop it! Stop it!"
4, 66, "Bender", "You killed Fry!"
4, 66, "Leela", "OK, I'm insane! But I'm still sane enough to know it.  The only time I feel alright is in my dreams, with you.  Three spoonfuls. Then I can dream forever.  One. Two  Here goes. Goodbye, waking world."
4, 66, "Fry's Photo", "Leela! No!  Listen to me, you don't want to lie in bed like a vegetable and do nothing the rest of your life. I've tried it. Bedsores hurt!"
4, 66, "Leela", "Then what am I s'posed to do?"
4, 66, "Fry's Photo", "Fight it!"
4, 66, "Leela", "I can't!"
4, 66, "Fry's Photo", "You can! The Leela I know doesn't give up this easily."
4, 66, "Leela", "OK. I'll try.  Go away!"
4, 66, "Fry's Photo", "I don't know if you can hear me, Leela, but there's something I wanna tell you. I love you."
4, 66, "Leela", "I'm so scared, Fry. I don't know what to do."
4, 66, "Fry's Photo", "Just wake up, Leela. Please. Just wake up."
4, 66, "Leela", "I don't understand what you mean!"
4, 66, "Fry", "Just wake up. Please. Just wake up, Leela."
4, 66, "Leela", "Fry. You're alive!"
4, 66, "Fry", "Leela! You're awake!"
4, 66, "Leela", "Of course I'm awake. You wouldn't stop waking me.  Where am I?"
4, 66, "Fry", "In the hospital. The ambulance took you here right after the bee stung you."
4, 66, "Leela", "But the bee stung you. It barely touched me."
4, 66, "Fry", "The stinger went right through me and you got all the poison. My new spleen came from a guy who liked to motorcycle."
4, 66, "Hermes", "Sweet three-toed sloth of ice planet Hoth! She's awake!"
4, 66, "Bender", "You were in the best coma I've ever seen!"
4, 66, "Amy", "The doctor said you'd never wake up."
4, 66, "Leela", "Really? How long was I out?"
4, 66, "Amy", "Two weeks. Fry never left your side for a minute."
4, 66, "Zoidberg", "And he talked non-stop. Like a parrot of the sea, he was!"
4, 66, "Fry", "I though that maybe if you heard a familiar voice it might help keep your mind together. But who knows if it really got through."
4, 66, "Leela", "It got through, Fry.  It got through."
4, 66, "Leela", "You could really use a shower."
4, 66, "Fry", "You too!"
4, 67, "TV Commentator", "Welcome to the games of the 3004 Earth Olympiad. Continuing this network's tradition of sports-casting excellence.  Celebrity Ape Fight will return next week at its regular time."
4, 67, "Fry", "So who should I root for? America or one of those countries I learned about at the food court?"
4, 67, "Amy", "How 'bout those guys?"
4, 67, "Leela", "No, they're from the Republic of French Stereotypes. Everybody hates them."
4, 67, "Farnsworth", "Oh, let's go check on Hermes. All this inspiring multi-culturalism is angrying up my blood.  Sweden? I don't think so!"
4, 67, "Hermes", "Go on, stick, touch me! Can't do it!"
4, 67, "LaBarbara", "Husband, you haven't been an Olympic-class limbo-er for 20 years! Quit lying to your podgy self."
4, 67, "Leela", "It does seem like Jamaica will be able to field a strong limbo team without you."
4, 67, "Amy", "Yeah, isn't that basically all Jamaicans do?"
4, 67, "Hermes", "Jamaicans have other interests. Which is why the limbo team got detained at the airport."
4, 67, "LaBarbara", "That's when they begged my husband to step in and make an ass out of himself."
4, 67, "Hermes", "And I said I'd try my very best."
4, 67, "Fry", "But have they seen your ... y'know ... physique, since the old days?"
4, 67, "Hermes", "I described it to them on the phone ... using a series of artful euphemisms."
4, 67, "Farnsworth", "Don't worry. The fat pig will do fine thanks to this flabbo-dynamic spandex bodysuit I've designed.  It redistributes his weight, shifting his centre of gravity closer to his knees."
4, 67, "Hermes", "Ooh, that's snug!  Oh, those haven't descended in years."
4, 67, "Farnsworth", "Now that's a limbo-er's body!"
4, 67, "LaBarbara", "Look at that fine Jamaican bacon!"
4, 67, "Bender", "Shut up, Zoidberg! The robot bending events are starting.  Something tells me I could easily beat those trained professionals.  Wow! That guy must be like the world's greatest bender. My dreams of glory died before they began."
4, 67, "Zoidberg", "Welcome to my life!"
4, 67, "Female Announcer", "Athletes, please take your lanes for the men's 500 metre limbo."
4, 67, "Barbados Slim", "Hermes Conrad, is that you inside that dumpy little fat man?"
4, 67, "Hermes", "Barbados Slim! What are you doing here? Last time I heard you were in Barbados."
4, 67, "Barbados Slim", "Yes and I be going back there with a gold medal draped around my elegant Caribbean shoulders."
4, 67, "Hermes", "Your body may be as perfectly-sculpted as it was 20 years ago when you whupped my fat ass every time we met.  But today, I feel lucky."
4, 67, "Barbados Slim", "I see you're still able to limbo under the bar of fashion sense!"
4, 67, "Hermes", "That's it, Barbados Slim. You've gone one toke over the line!"
4, 67, "Man", "Limbo-ers, on your marks. Get rubbery. Limbo!"
4, 67, "Commentator", "There they go, and Barbados Slim takes an early lead. God, I hope he wins.  What's this? Hermes Conrad is closing the gap. He's limbo-ed out of retirement and straight into my heart. I say go to hell, Barbados Slim!"
4, 67, "Farnsworth", "Go, bodysuit, go!"
4, 67, "Zoidberg", "Go!"
4, 67, "Bender", "C'mon!"
4, 67, "LaBarbara", "C'mon, Hermes, beat that mahogany god!"
4, 67, "Commentator", "It's Barbados, then Conrad. Conrad pulls ahead!  And Conrad is disqualified! Barbados Slim, my hero, takes the gold!"
4, 67, "LaBarbara", "Aw, there, there, Hermes.  You did your best. If I'd wanted a human Adonis for a husband, I'd have stayed married to Barbados Slim."
4, 67, "Bender", "Well, enough about Hermes. I couldn't win a medal either. Even at bending, the thing I was built to do. I'm so embarrassed. I wish everybody else was dead."
4, 67, "Female Announcer", "Up next, the Fembot bending competition."
4, 67, "Bender", "Fembots?  Methinks a clever Manbot suitably disguised might win those events! But the charade would require subtlety, nuance, grace."
4, 67, "Bender", "What do you mean I'm not registered? My name is Coilette and I'm from, uh ... Robonia! Coilette's a chick's name!"
4, 67, "Official", "Yes but ""Robonia"" sounds like something somebody made up on the spot."
4, 67, "Bender", "Ever been beaten up by a guy dressed like a chick?"
4, 67, "Commentator", "And it's straight! Coilette wins!"
4, 67, "Commentator", "Another gold medal for the spunky maid from Robonia."
4, 67, "Commentator", "A perfect bend and a flawless entry. No splash at all!  Perfect scores! A record five gold medals for Coilette!"
4, 67, "Bender", "I'm great! Everybody else sucks! Except that guy Bender. He's really somethin'!"
4, 67, "Female Announcer", "All medallists report for gender testing."
4, 67, "Leela", "You actually thought they'd let you walk away without an engine oil sex check?"
4, 67, "Bender", "Oh, God, I'm not gonna get my medals! They're all I have to remember my Olympic career.  Wait, I've got it! Professor, make a woman out of me!"
4, 67, "Farnsworth", "Oh, I think we should just stay friends."
4, 67, "Bender", "I don't need friends. I need a sex change operation and give it to me now!"
4, 67, "Farnsworth", "Bender, a robot sex change is a complex and dangerous procedure. Replacing your testosteroil with Fembot lubricants can cause wild mood swings. And the effects may be irreversible. Well, let's get started!"
4, 67, "Leela", "No, you can't!"
4, 67, "Amy", "If you have even the slightest respect for the dignity of women--"
4, 67, "Bender", "Pft."
4, 67, "Farnsworth", "I'm sorry, ladies, but I must do this. Not for you, not for Bender, but for the proud people of Robonia!"
4, 67, "Bender", "C'mon!"
4, 67, "Fry", "I can't watch this 'cause it's creepy and wrong and sick. However, I will watch out of curiosity."
4, 67, "Farnsworth", "Quiet!  I'm about to begin the process of reshaping Bender's body into a tender, delicate form."
4, 67, "Farnsworth", "Draining male oil.  Infusing female oil.  Removing item."
4, 67, "Robot", "We can't wait for Coilette any longer, damnit. I have to get home to watch The Zombie Osbournes."
4, 67, "Coilette", "I'm ready for my test now, boys."
4, 67, "Coilette", "Hail, hail, Robonia. A land I didn't make up."
4, 67, "Coilette", "Ooh, yeah! Come on, baby! Boom!"
4, 67, "Coilette", "Oh, yeah, baby! C'mon! Work your cans! That's it! Shake it out!"
4, 67, "Leela", "I don't know which I'm more"
4, 67, "Coilette", "I'm just out there making us ladies look good."
4, 67, "Amy", "Snuh-uh! You're making us look like jerks in front of the other genders."
4, 67, "Fry", "But you're not really a lady anyway. Right?"
4, 67, "Coilette", "Of course not."
4, 67, "Farnsworth", "Dear Lord! A coaster! The Femmzoil must be sachet-ing girlishly into your processor."
4, 67, "Coilette", "Then change me back. My breasts are keeping me awake at night anyway.  Hello? What? A guest spot on Late Night With Humorbot 5.0? I'd love to!  My own limo? No I don't have my own limo. You'd better send one.  I need a rain check on that nad-swap, Professor. I'm going on TV. C'mon, Fry. Help me pick out a pantsuit."
4, 67, "Humorbot 5.0", "So, Calculon, do you want to set up this clip from All My Circuits?"
4, 67, "Calculon", "No, I think it's self-explanatory."
4, 67, "Calculon", "Nooo!"
4, 67, "Calculon", "Funny story"
4, 67, "Humorbot 5.0", "Anecdote accepted. Snappy comeback not found. Please put your hands together for my next guest. Winner of five Olympic medals, Coilette from Robonia.  So, Coilette, many young Fembot's wish to emulate you. Any advice for them?"
4, 67, "Coilette", "Yes, Humorbot. If you ask me, women today are too stuck up to go out and jiggle their Jello like everybody wants them to. In fact, should I do it now?  Alright then!  Woo! Look out, baby! Work it out! Ooh, shake that thing! You gotta use it, lady! Shake it up a little! That's right. Come on! Look at that!"
4, 67, "Calculon", "Madam, I am one impressed celebrity."
4, 67, "Coilette", "Oh, I bet you say that to all the five-Olympic-gold medal-winning Fembots!"
4, 67, "Calculon", "From this day forward I shall do so whenever possible."
4, 67, "Coilette", "Golly ... what?"
4, 67, "Calculon", "Coilette, this may be presumptuous--"
4, 67, "Coilette", "That's my favourite kind of this!"
4, 67, "Calculon", "But I would be honoured if you would join me for dinner sometime."
4, 67, "Coilette", "Calculon, you'd be fulfilling this naive Robonian farmgirl's fantasy."
4, 67, "Calculon", "Of course I would."
4, 67, "Coilette", "This top makes me look fat. Is it trampy to go on a first date nude?"
4, 67, "Amy", "Yes."
4, 67, "Coilette", "Perfect."
4, 67, "Fry", "You gotta tell me"
4, 67, "Coilette", "Certainly not. But just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Is that so much to ask?"
4, 67, "Leela", "Well I think you dating a Manbot is a disgrace and I refuse to be involved. And you have way too much lipstick on."
4, 67, "Coilette", "Are you kidding? I need more lipstick! Much more!  Ooh, yeah! That's the stuff! Men love it when you really glob it on."
4, 67, "Leela", "No, they don't."
4, 67, "Amy", "No way!"
4, 67, "Coilette", "Oh, please! Every man wants a tramp. No wonder you girls aren't married.  I tell you, men are so much better at being women."
4, 67, "Fry", "But what if he wants to-- I mean, if he tries to ... uh ... Barry White?"
4, 67, "Coilette", "I'll just tell him I need a commitment first. That'll stick a potato in his tailpipe!"
4, 67, "Hermes", "Good Lord, man! What kind of temporary woman are you?"
4, 67, "Coilette", "Look, why don't all of you just back off? Can't a girl enjoy herself without being judged?"
4, 67, "Farnsworth", "Oh, dear. Her mood swings are getting wilder. She's becoming a slave to her emotions. Just like all women. Particularly you, Leela."
4, 67, "Leela", "I'm worried about him too, Professor."
4, 67, "Elzar", "Hey, ma'am, you sure can put it away! You saved me a trip to the dump. Bam!"
4, 67, "Calculon", "I'd appreciate it if you didn't bam the young lady."
4, 67, "Elzar", "Well, I'd appreciate it if I did. So I guess we're even."
4, 67, "Calculon", "You know, Coilette, I've never before met a woman as fascinating as I am. You're such a sweet, soft Fembot. And you have this free spirit about you.  And there it is. It's as if you understand the male mind better than I!  I've never met anyone like you."
4, 67, "Coilette", "Oh, yes, you have."
4, 67, "Calculon", "Coilette, I'd like to spend some  quality time with you."
4, 67, "Coilette", "What? Ah! Whoa! No way! Not gonna happen. What kind of girl do you think I am?"
4, 67, "Calculon", "Have I mentioned that I own the world's biggest and most elegant yacht?"
4, 67, "Coilette", "Woo! I'm a trophy girlfriend!"
4, 67, "Amy", "No kidding. These gifts have been coming non-stop!  I think Calculon's falling for you."
4, 67, "Coilette", "Bah! Any day now he'll dump me for a new wad of arm candy. And then I can turn back into a guy and hock all this stuff! It's just a game."
4, 67, "Calculon", "Coilette, I can't stop thinking about you. I can't sleep at night, although, as a robot, I don't do that anyway. But if I did I couldn't because I love you so.  Oh, my darling ...  ... Will you marry me?"
4, 67, "Coilette", "Oh, Calculon! Yes, I will!"
4, 67, "Amy", "Maybe she's right about the lipstick."
4, 67, "Fry", "I'll miss you, buddy. You've been like a brother and then a sister to me. And now you're getting married. I love you, man."
4, 67, "Coilette", "The marriage is a scam."
4, 67, "Fry", "Cool. What's for dinner?"
4, 67, "Leela", "What do you mean ""a scam""?"
4, 67, "Coilette", "I marry Calculon, divorce him, take half his money and turn back into a guy. It's sort of a two-person pyramid scheme."
4, 67, "Fry", "That's marriage alright!"
4, 67, "Leela", "That is so unbelievably manipulative."
4, 67, "Coilette", "Come on! You never went on a date with a guy just 'cause you were hungry?"
4, 67, "Leela", "Well I, uh, I thought I might like him on a full stomach."
4, 67, "Coilette", "Nice try, sister. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to meet with my wedding planner.  Zoidberg.   Zoidypoo, please tell me frilly is in this year."
4, 67, "Zoidberg", "I saw a frilly cake in here you would remember all your life. I know I will. Late at night it haunts me with its frosted beauty.  Order the cake, damnit!"
4, 67, "Calculon", "I have something for you."
4, 67, "Coilette", "A remote control? You got me a TV?"
4, 67, "Calculon", "No, my dearest, it's the remote control to my heart. It symbolises the power you have to sway my emotions."
4, 67, "Coilette", "Will it work on my TV?"
4, 67, "Calculon", "We don't need TVs, we have each other! Coilette, if I weren't able to spend my life with you I would leap from this very balloon."
4, 67, "Coilette", "Come on with that. Really?"
4, 67, "Calculon", "Yes! We were meant to be."
4, 67, "Coilette", "So ... you really and truly love me?"
4, 67, "Calculon", "So much so that I'm prepared to give up showbusiness itself to be with you."
4, 67, "Coilette", "But, you always said you'd rather burn down a convent than give up showbusiness."
4, 67, "Calculon", "I always said many things. But now all I want is a peaceful life and a quiet villa overlooking a vineyard ... with you."
4, 67, "Coilette", "Would we have donkeys?"
4, 67, "Calculon", "All you could eat!"
4, 67, "Coilette", "Oh, take me in your arms and compress me. Compress me tight!"
4, 67, "Calculon", "Stop! Let us climb to the heavens that the gods themselves might envy us!"
4, 67, "Coilette", "I just don't think I can go through with this scam."
4, 67, "Amy", "What?"
4, 67, "Fry", "So now you do wanna marry him?"
4, 67, "Coilette", "No, I just don't wanna hurt him, or humiliate him. Oh, curse this woman's heart!"
4, 67, "Fry", "Eck!"
4, 67, "Farnsworth", "You're falling into the final debilitating stages of womanhood. You've waited too long to switch back, you ding bat!"
4, 67, "Leela", "OK, look. If I help you with this do you promise to get out of my gender and stay out?"
4, 67, "Coilette", "Uh-huh."
4, 67, "Leela", "Alright. Now there's no way to stop this marriage without hurting Calculon. But he's an actor. If there's one kind of pain he can handle, it's soap opera pain."
4, 67, "Leela", "OK, is everyone ready?"
4, 67, "Fry", "Check."
4, 67, "Amy", "Uh-huh."
4, 67, "Hermes", "Yep!"
4, 67, "Zoidberg", "Basically."
4, 67, "Preacherbot", "Dearly beloved actors and casting people who might be looking for someone to play a preacher, I welcome you. The bride has written some vows that we will now all pretend to be interested in."
4, 67, "Coilette", "Dearest Calculon, forever is not enough time to tell you of the many ways I love you."
4, 67, "Hedonismbot", "Oh, my!"
4, 67, "Calculon", "Is there a doctor in the--"
4, 67, "Zoidberg", "I came as soon as I could.  It appears to be a case of African hydraulic fever!"
4, 67, "Calculon", "Dear God! The very illness my TV character caught in season two when I was holding out for more money. It's often fatal."
4, 67, "Coilette", "Whatever happens, remember, the flame of my eternal love will burn forever."
4, 67, "Calculon", "Of course. But, smoochiepups, I thought one could only catch hydraulic fever deep in the diamond mines of the Congo."
4, 67, "Leela", "Coilette, you she-devil!  You really thought you could steal those diamonds from me and Congo Jack?"
4, 67, "Coilette", "Those gems belong to the natives!"
4, 67, "Leela", "Hi-yah!"
4, 67, "Calculon", "Oh, how cruel and melodramatic fate is.  Why?"
4, 67, "Coilette", "Calculon, my darling, your loud ""why"" brought me partway back to life.  Congo Jack!"
4, 67, "Calculon", "Another shocking twist!"
4, 67, "Fry", "Yes. And I have a message for you from Colonel Mitumbay! He says this ...  ... is from Congo Jack."
4, 67, "Coilette", "Uh, um..."
4, 67, "Calculon", "No! Nooo!  N-O-O-O!"
4, 67, "Coilette", "I won't leave you. Not until I'm sure you understand the thing I said before. About my eternal love for you burning ...  ... et cetera."
4, 67, "Calculon", "I do. I do."
4, 67, "Coilette", "OK then."
4, 67, "Zoidberg", "I'm a doctor, she's dead."
4, 67, "Calculon", "She lives no more. But let us all find comfort knowing that she truly loved me. To honour my pain, I shall star in a film dedicated to her memory. And this time, the Academy will not deny me. Not when they see Coilette"
4, 67, "Calculon", "Coilette, your death fills me with sorrow,  anger,  fear,  every emotion an actor can display."
4, 67, "Farnsworth", "Turn off that crap-o-rama! One mistake now and Bender will be trapped forever between the already ill-defined robot sexes."
4, 67, "Coilette", "Ow! Ooh! Ow! Oh!"
4, 67, "Fry", "Well, Bender, I hope this has taught you a lesson about changing your sex to win five gold medals."
4, 67, "Coilette", "It truly has. My romance with Calculon has shown me a lot about myself."
4, 67, "Farnsworth", "Almost done."
4, 67, "Coilette", "If only somehow, someway, he and I could--"
4, 67, "Bender", "Drive to Vegas, pick up some Flooziebots and void their warranties all night long!"
4, 67, "Fry", "Yay! My buddy's home! And his respect for women is back to normal."
4, 67, "Leela", "I kind of hoped this whole experience would have left you a little more open to your sensitive side."
4, 67, "Bender", "Yeah, you'd think, but what you gonna do?"
4, 67, "Calculon", "Coilette, the skies themselves weep upon the sweetest flower of all the field."
4, 67, "Leela", "Aw!"
4, 67, "Amy", "Aw!"
4, 67, "Fry", "Ew!"
4, 67, "Zoidberg", "Gross."
4, 67, "Farnsworth", "Sentimental drivel-poop."
4, 67, "Fry", "C'mon, Bender, let's go. This chick-flick is getting me all barfy."
4, 67, "Bender", "Yeah. Emotions are dumb and should be hated."
4, 67, "Calculon", "Goodnight, Coilette, my turtle dove."
4, 67, "Bender", "Goodnight, Calculon."
4, 67, "Leela", "What did you say?"
4, 67, "Bender", "I said you two don't dress trampy enough.  I still got it!"
4, 68, "Man", "$10, please."
4, 68, "Fry", "Aw, man!"
4, 68, "Nannybot 1.0", "Sleep, little dumpling. I have replaced your mother."
4, 68, "Leela", "Aw!"
4, 68, "Bender", "Oh, my God! Robot beely-boppers!"
4, 68, "Fry", "And there's a robot scratching post.  You should try it out, Bender."
4, 68, "Bender", "Please, I have some dignity!"
4, 68, "Wernstrom", "Ladies and gentlemen, my Killbot features Lotus Notes and a machine gun. It is the finest available."
4, 68, "Farnsworth", "Like fun it is, you glass-headed wallaby!"
4, 68, "Wernstrom", "No one calls me that! I'm having at you!"
4, 68, "Farnsworth", "Wernstrom!"
4, 68, "Farnsworth's Killbot", "Such senseless aggression."
4, 68, "Wernstrom's Killbot", "Come on. Let's go for a paddle-boat ride."
4, 68, "Bender", "The secret was scratching really, really hard!"
4, 68, "Announcer", "And now, the woman who Mom-opolises the robot industry--"
4, 68, "Fry", "I get it!"
4, 68, "Announcer", "Mom!"
4, 68, "Fry", "Oh, now I get it!"
4, 68, "Mom", "Hello, dearies."
4, 68, "Bender", "Woo! I love that old bat!"
4, 68, "Mom", "Ladies and gentlemen, for the 17th year in a row, the future of robotics has arrived. Boys?  I give you ... Robot 1-X!"
4, 68, "Larry", "Ow!"
4, 68, "Igner", "Ow! Oh!"
4, 68, "Bender", "Neat!"
4, 68, "Mom", "Quite frankly, Robot 1-X will put all my previous models to shame. Incidentally, would one of my previous models mind coming up here?"
4, 68, "Bender", "Right here! I'm comin'! C'mon, baby! I'll do it! C'mon, Mom!"
4, 68, "Refreshment-bot", "Jerk!"
4, 68, "Bender", "Here we go. I'm your top of the line, Mom."
4, 68, "Mom", "Notice that this obsolete robot runs on alcohol and emits pollution. Whereas Robot 1-X runs on pollution and emits pure oxygen with a fresh pine scent."
4, 68, "Bender", "Man, that smells great!"
4, 68, "Mom", "Now, let's see how both robots do at a typical household task"
4, 68, "Robot 1-X", "Task completed. Total value, $4.73 and one Albanian lek."
4, 68, "Mom", "Very good, Robot 1-X. And you, bending unit?"
4, 68, "Bender", "Uh, I never got the change.  Suckers."
4, 68, "Mom", "Presenting Mom's Friendly Robots."
4, 68, "Bender", "That new robot is great, huh? Sure made me look like a pile of crap!"
4, 68, "Farnsworth", "Indeed. That's why I bought one to help around the office."
4, 68, "Bender", "Eep!"
4, 68, "Leela", "Let's try him out. Robot 1-X, can you clean Nibbler's stanky litterbox?"
4, 68, "Robot 1-X", "I can and will."
4, 68, "Bender", "Hey, I could have done that if you'd asked me."
4, 68, "Leela", "I asked you five minutes ago."
4, 68, "Bender", "You call that a kiss? I'll show you!  C'mere, Nibbler!"
4, 68, "Farnsworth", "Oh, look, Bender. If you want something to do stop making out and give us a hand."
4, 68, "Hermes", "Here. Go up on the roof and install this fake satellite dish so we can impress the neighbours."
4, 68, "Bender", "Yes, sir. I'm on it!"
4, 68, "Hermes", "Oh, and have Robot 1-X help you."
4, 68, "Bender", "Get outta here, freshman! I don't need your help."
4, 68, "Robot 1-X", "Our owners asked me to assist you."
4, 68, "Bender", "Yeah? Well assist this!"
4, 68, "Bender", "When I screamed ""help"" I didn't mean you!"
4, 68, "Robot 1-X", "I apologise. However, I was able to do your job before I saved your life."
4, 68, "Bender", "Don't mind me. I'm just saving you the trouble of throwing me away."
4, 68, "Amy", "Spleesh! Mell out, Bender. Come watch some TV."
4, 68, "Bender", "I can't. I'm stuck in the can."
4, 68, "Leela", "Well, ask Robot 1-X to pull you out."
4, 68, "Bender", "Never!"
4, 68, "Leela", "Why can't you accept his help?"
4, 68, "Bender", "I hate him."
4, 68, "Leela", "But he's just a tool to make your life easier. Like a socket wrench or a burglar's kit."
4, 68, "Bender", "I can't ask for his help because--"
4, 68, "Farnsworth", "Yes?"
4, 68, "Bender", "I'm scared of him."
4, 68, "Leela", "Oh, sorry."
4, 68, "Farnsworth", "Well then there's only one solution"
4, 68, "Bender", "An upgrade? But I thought we all agreed I was perfect! Fry, didn't we agree I was perfect?"
4, 68, "Fry", "Oh, yeah, no, you're pretty perfect."
4, 68, "Bender", "Pretty perfect? So, you do think I need an upgrade?"
4, 68, "Farnsworth", "Yes! For God's sakes, yes!"
4, 68, "Bender", "Fine. I'll be back in a few days."
4, 68, "Roberto", "Man, I hate those new 1-X robots. I'd like to stab 'em! Give 'em some of these!"
4, 68, "Bender", "Yeah! Right on, nutcake!"
4, 68, "Roberto", "Parole officer says I gotta upgrade or he won't give me back my stabbing knife. But it's no big. I hate those 1-X so much I know it won't affect me.  Death to the 1-X robots!  I love those magnificent 1-X robots! The 1-X robots are my friends."
4, 68, "Bender", "W-W-Wait! What happened to your enthusiasm for stabbing them?"
4, 68, "Roberto", "I'm past that. Later, blood!"
4, 68, "Bender", "It's like he's not him anymore.  You took away his robo-humanity.  I changed my mind!"
4, 68, "Bender", "I did it! I escaped! But to what kind of a life?  I'm too scared to get the upgrade but I can't face my friends again without it.  And so I set sail for unknown shores. Oh, merciful Poseidon, take pity on this mechanical mariner.  Oh, jeez!"
4, 68, "Bender", "Curse you, merciful Poseidon!"
4, 68, "Bender", "Boy, what is the deal with the ocean? A tropical island, huh? Well, I've washed up on worse places. OK, first up, I'm gonna need to build a shelter.  There. Well, I guess I'll go out for a while."
4, 68, "Bender", "Damn. One rock short of rescue!"
4, 68, "Bender", "Oop! Low on power.  Better fuel up!  Oh, no! Guess I'll do what I always do when I run out of booze."
4, 68, "Bender", "Don't panic, I've got these yams. I'll just make some yam schnapps."
4, 68, "Bender", "Hey, I should be mad at you! Now turn around."
4, 68, "Bender", "Beer!  Ow!"
4, 68, "Bender", "Who ... is ... it?  Ow!"
4, 68, "Bender", "Who are you and why should I care?"
4, 68, "Cartridge Unit", "Side A.  We're a community of outdated robots who refused to upgrade and came here--   Side B.  To live a simpler existence, free of technology."
4, 68, "Bender", "A working cartridge unit? Wow! You guys went obsolete years ago!"
4, 68, "Cartridge Unit", "Your mother."
4, 68, "Lisa", "What Cartridge Unit means is the very things that make us obsolete also make us unique. I, for example, need to keep refilling my waterwheel or I'll power down forever.   Oh, God! I'll never make it this time! This is the end!   Anyway, we like it here."
4, 68, "Bender", "Like you have a choice.  So what's your problem?"
4, 68, "Sinclair", "Not enough... uh--"
4, 68, "Bender", "Memory?"
4, 68, "Sinclair", "Oh, great. Now I remember that word but I forgot my wife's face."
4, 68, "Lisa", "Oh, God, no! I want to live!   If you'd like, you're welcome to join our society."
4, 68, "Bender", "Look, no offence, but I need technology. Especially email and snowmobiles. And television! Without television how will I know what's buzz-worthy?"
4, 68, "Sinclair", "Why would you wanna watch TV when you can watch a snail crawl for hours on end?"
4, 68, "Bender", "That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."
4, 68, "Bender", "Oh, man! He's never gonna make it over that next pebble! Wait, wait! Oh, my God! He made it!"
4, 68, "Lisa", "Yeah!"
4, 68, "Sinclair", "Way to go!"
4, 68, "Bender", "That was the greatest thing ever! Let's party!  Yeah, baby! C'mon!"
4, 68, "Lisa", "Where did you get that CD?"
4, 68, "Bender", "It's one of my ten desert island discs. I never really thought I'd get to use them. But look at me now. Ooh, yeah, baby! Do that thang!"
4, 68, "Lisa", "CDs are unnatural. Why don't you just listen to the ocean?"
4, 68, "Bender", "Which ocean? That ocean?  Whoa! It's like the earth is making sweet, salty love to itself while all the fish groove on it. So much for this garbage.  Take that, Beethoven, you deaf bastard!"
4, 68, "Bender", "Bang, bang, bang. You sure got this life thing figured out, cymbal-banging monkey."
4, 68, "Lisa", "Hi, Bender. We know how much you miss technology, so we brought you this washing machine that drifted ashore."
4, 68, "Bender", "Ooh! I'm gonna wash my linen so hard the w--  You--!"
4, 68, "Lisa", "What? I don't understand."
4, 68, "Sinclair", "Is he alright?"
4, 68, "Bender", "Wretched technology has brought me nothing but misery!"
4, 68, "Cartridge Unit", "But, Bender, you are technology. You're the most advanced thing on this entire island."
4, 68, "Bender", "Oh, it's true. I am a hideous triumph of form and function.  But not for long!"
4, 68, "Bender", "Oh! Ow, that hurt! Oh!"
4, 68, "Lisa", "The downgrade is complete!"
4, 68, "Bender", "Behold, my hand crafted purity. The modern world can bite my splintery, wooden ass!"
4, 68, "Lisa", "Welcome to your new life of simple tranquillity."
4, 68, "Bender", "Pft! Forget that. I say the whole world must learn of our peaceful ways. By force!"
4, 68, "Cartridge Unit", "What?!"
4, 68, "Bender", "We're going back to civilisation to wage war on technology!"
4, 68, "Cartridge Unit", "What?!"
4, 68, "Bender", "Row, comrades! Row!"
4, 68, "Bender", "We'll soon stage an attack on technology worthy of being chronicled in an anthem by Rush!"
4, 68, "Lisa", "We've been sailing for three weeks. Maybe I should check our position with the periscope."
4, 68, "Bender", "Mirrors reflecting mirrors? Hi-tech sorcery! Sorcery, I say!"
4, 68, "Lisa", "Did you see anything?"
4, 68, "Bender", "Yep, we're there. Prepare to surface!"
4, 68, "Bender", "And now, technology shall taste the lash of the hickory switch!"
4, 68, "Sinclair", "Technology is defeated. Let us return to the island and celebrate by counting rocks!"
4, 68, "Cartridge Unit", "I'm for that!"
4, 68, "Bender", "Whoa, whoa! No one wants to count rocks more than me. But our mission is not complete. Not so long as Robot 1-X torments me with his obvious superiority. Ready the catapult, Sinclair.  Aim for their power lines. They're the devil's veins and electricity is his blood."
4, 68, "Lisa", "Bender, If we don't survive the attack, I want you to know ... I love you."
4, 68, "Bender", "OK, fine. Fire!"
4, 68, "Farnsworth", "Oh! I'm blind!"
4, 68, "Leela", "Professor, we have no power."
4, 68, "Farnsworth", "What do you mean ""no power""? We're living in the future."
4, 68, "Leela", "I'd better light some candles."
4, 68, "Bender", "Friends, I've come to free you from your complicated lives. Free you from the ""complicated"" part I mean not the ""lives"" part."
4, 68, "Leela", "Oh, Lord, he's made of wood! What now, Bender?"
4, 68, "Bender", "I got a downgrade! I'm a steam-powered wooden robot, just as nature intended. Therefore, I must kill Robot 1-X."
4, 68, "Farnsworth", "That's just stupid."
4, 68, "Robot 1-X", "Does Mr. Bender wish me to destroy myself?"
4, 68, "Bender", "I don't need your charity.   Target Robot 1-X and fire!"
4, 68, "Farnsworth", "You wanged my ship, you walnut-panelled idiot!"
4, 68, "Bender", "Try again, Sinclair. I said ""target Robot 1-X""!"
4, 68, "Sinclair", "Who's Robot 1-X? Launching."
4, 68, "Zoidberg", "So, I guess everything worked out fine."
4, 68, "Leela", "Great! Now we're being crushed."
4, 68, "Amy", "Help us, wooden Bender!"
4, 68, "Bender", "Heck! Those guys hate fire! I gotta do something.  What the--? Termites? Well, I don't need legs to save my friends. I'll just use the old extentromatic arms!"
4, 68, "Hermes", "Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also  we're dying!"
4, 68, "Bender", "I'm a-comin'  Ow! Lousy primitive body! Oh, why didn't I get that upgrade? I'm an outdated piece of junk!"
4, 68, "Robot 1-X", "Sir, might I recommend--"
4, 68, "Bender", "You shut up. No, wait! I can use you as a tool to save my friends and I'll still be the hero who everyone says how great he was!"
4, 68, "Robot 1-X", "How may I help you?"
4, 68, "Bender", "Save my friends!  And Zoidberg!"
4, 68, "Amy", "Look! My hair got singed into an even cuter do!"
4, 68, "Fry", "Hey, where's Bender?"
4, 68, "Bender", "Down here.  I'm so sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in."
4, 68, "Leela", "Well, at least you saved us from, uh, you. Thank God you finally overcame your incompatibility with Robot 1-X."
4, 68, "Bender", "Oh, yeah, we were totally in sync! I was like ""Save them!"" and he was all ""No problem!"" and then he did it--"
4, 68, "Bender", "This new technology is great!  I love those magnificent 1-X robots. The 1-X robots are my friends!"
4, 68, "Fatbot", "It's like his personality is totally different now! Oh, maybe this upgrade isn't such a good idea."
4, 68, "Bender", "I'd like to give Robot 1-X a big smooch on the--  Hey! What's the dealy-o?"
4, 68, "Technician", "Your upgrade is complete."
4, 68, "Bender", "But I destroyed the technology of the world. I ran on the beach and felt the sand between my foot cups."
4, 68, "Technician", "Everyone experiences the upgrade differently."
4, 68, "Bender", "Oof. If that stuff wasn't real, how can I be sure anything is real? Is it not possible, nay, probable, that my whole life is just a product of my or someone else's imagination?"
4, 68, "Technician", "No, get out.  Next."
4, 68, "Bender", "Well, I guess reality is what you make of it.  Oh, thanks, baby!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth", "Oh, Lordy Lou! Help!"
4, 69, "Fry", "I know you've rejected me a lot before but, frankly, I wasn't sure we were right for each other either. But now I am. So how 'bout a date tonight?"
4, 69, "Leela", "Sorry. I think I, um, I think I left my toaster on."
4, 69, "Farnsworth", "Buddha! Zeus! God! One of you guys do something!"
4, 69, "Fry", "Come on, Leela, what's the real reason you won't go out with me?"
4, 69, "Farnsworth", "Help! Satan! You owe me!"
4, 69, "Leela", "Look, um, I'm embarrassed to admit this but you forced me to"
4, 69, "Amy", "No spluh! Why do you think I'm sitting over here in the stink-free zone?"
4, 69, "Fry", "So, will you go out with me?"
4, 69, "Farnsworth", "Good news, everyone. I'm still technically alive. Yes!  But I need to you to dispose of this crazy-ass experiment that almost killed me.  You'll have to throw it into the sun itself. For only the thermo-nuclear inferno of the sun has enough energy to ensure its total destruction."
4, 69, "Bender", "I can hit it with a shovel."
4, 69, "Farnsworth", "That's not good enough."
4, 69, "Bender", "This one time I pounded a guy into the ground like a stake with a shovel."
4, 69, "Farnsworth", "Yes, yes."
4, 69, "Zoidberg", "So what's in the box, already?"
4, 69, "Farnsworth", "No peeking!  I don't know what's in there but I'm sure our minds would be unable to comprehend it."
4, 69, "Hermes", "Ow! You hurt my collator!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth", "I don't care.  Listen well"
4, 69, "Fry", "Whatever's in there, it's the only thing I've ever wanted."
4, 69, "Zoidberg", "In my experience, boxes are usually empty. Or maybe with a little cheese stuck to the top. And one time pepperoni!  What a day that was!   Give me the box!"
4, 69, "Hermes", "Scram, you lousy green snakes!  Here, Leela. Take this and use it to shoot those guys."
4, 69, "Leela", "Right. If they try to look in the box."
4, 69, "Hermes", "Whatever."
4, 69, "Fry", "Let's just forget about the box. The Professor said to stay away."
4, 69, "Bender", "Fry, how can you be so naive? He was joking. Get it?"
4, 69, "Fry", "No."
4, 69, "Bender", "That's what makes it so funny!  OK, he wasn't joking. Now shut up and follow me."
4, 69, "Fry", "Ow! It's hot! The butter in my pocket is melting."
4, 69, "Bender", "We thank you, Bender, for the gift we are about to receive."
4, 69, "Fry", "Tangled-up Christmas lights! We can take shifts untangling them."
4, 69, "Bender", "And unlabeled booze! Wide-mouth too!"
4, 69, "Leela", "That oughta keep those dopes occupied.  I can guard the real box in peace now that no one's curious about it."
4, 69, "Leela", "Well, I got through the night and no one looked in the box. Not even me. The person who gave up her whole evening to watch it. A whole evening of TV gone. What a mockery of justice that I can't take even a little tiny peek.  I need coffee.  OK, heads I look, tails I don't.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah! Heads! I mean, alright then. No! I have a duty not to look. Well, then again, I promised the coin I would.  Oh, it's deep. Deeper than a small box should be."
4, 69, "Leela A", "Ouch! My lawyer will hear about this!"
4, 69, "Fry 1", "Leela, what have you done?"
4, 69, "Leela A", "Nothing. What do you mean ""Why was I looking in the box?"""
4, 69, "Fry 1", "I mean your hair. It's all different-y."
4, 69, "Leela A", "Bender? Is that you?"
4, 69, "Bender 1", "You know it! Large and in charge!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "Leela? Oh, there's a woman for you! Always dyeing her hair instead of not looking in a box."
4, 69, "Leela A", "I didn't dye my hair. This is how I always look."
4, 69, "Bender 1", "No, that's how you always look.  This throws my entire perception of reality into question. Clone? Robot? Or long-lost twin? Taking all bets! I also offer video poker."
4, 69, "Fry 1", "It's some guy wearing a Leela costume! Get him!"
4, 69, "Leela A", "Hold it! You have this all wrong. I just fell into the box and then I fell out somehow."
4, 69, "Fry 1", "You shut up, sir!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "No, wait! I've got it. I know what's in the box. Oh, I've been as dumb as Fry."
4, 69, "Fry 1", "Am not!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "It contains a parallel universe. And when you create a parallel universe, it's almost always populated by evil twins."
4, 69, "Leela A", "Now, look"
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "Oh, you'd like us to believe that wouldn't you, Leela? Or should I say Evil-a?"
4, 69, "Bender 1", "Oh, this is awful. Somewhere there's a Bender more evil than me. I do my best, damnit!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "Leela?  Uh, the good Leela.  I want you to snoop around the other universe and find out how evil they are.  Here."
4, 69, "Leela A", "I tell you they're not evil. But don't be confused. They are jerks."
4, 69, "Zoidberg A", "Hello!"
4, 69, "Leela 1", "Hi-yah!"
4, 69, "Zoidberg A", "Ow!"
4, 69, "Leela 1", "Come out of your universe with your hands up!"
4, 69, "Fry A", "Oh, wow! It's like that drug trip I saw in that movie when I was on that drug trip."
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "Astonishing! I must have created a parallel universe."
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "Baldercrap! I created your universe. All you created was my fist parallel to your face."
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "Ow."
4, 69, "Leela A", "Look, it doesn't matter who created what. The important thing is-- Yah!"
4, 69, "Leela 1", "We're exactly the same. I know all her moves. Therefore, I've got the upper hand."
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything."
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "Let's recap what's happened so far.  As you can see, I accidentally created a box containing your universe."
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "While I, in a simultaneous blunder, created a box containing your universe."
4, 69, "Leela A", "This is getting confusing. Why don't we call our universe ""Universe A"" and this universe ""Universe B""?"
4, 69, "Bender 1", "Hey! Why can't we be Universe A?"
4, 69, "Fry 1", "Yeah!"
4, 69, "Amy 1", "Yeah!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "We want A!"
4, 69, "Zoidberg 1", "It's the best letter!"
4, 69, "Fry A", "We called it first. Besides, this place kinda feels like a ""B"", y'know?"
4, 69, "Leela 1", "Alright, you can be crummy Universe A and we'll be Universe 1."
4, 69, "Fry 1", "Or ""The Mongooses"". That's a cool team name. The Fighting Mongooses!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "Wait a second. If everyone is identical, why did our Leela look into the box and your Leela didn't?"
4, 69, "Leela 1", "Well, to be honest, I tossed a coin. It came up tails so I didn't look."
4, 69, "Leela A", "That's weird. Mine came up heads, so I did."
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "Interesting. Apparently, the key difference between our universes is that coin flips have opposite outcomes."
4, 69, "Bender A", "That explains fruity here!  I tossed a coin to pick my finish. Fog hat grey!"
4, 69, "Bender 1", "Hey! Bite my glorious golden ass!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "You people and your slight differences disgust me. I'm going home. Where's that blue box with our universe in it?"
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "Oh, you'd like to get back to your evil universe, wouldn't you? And destroy your box with our universe inside it."
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "Nonsense! I would never do such a thing unless you were already having been going to do that!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "Wha?"
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "You heard me!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "In any case, I've hidden the box and it will remain hidden until I'm convinced you're not evil.  Everyone, keep an eye on your evil counterpart."
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "And you all do the same!"
4, 69, "Leela 1", "Um, can Fry and I watch our parallel selves together? We have plans tonight."
4, 69, "Leela A", "You guys are dating?!"
4, 69, "Fry 1", "Oh, no, no. We're married."
4, 69, "Bender A", "I've got my eye on you, boy!"
4, 69, "Bender 1", "Don't even think about it, lunch-pail! You'd be dead before you hit the ground."
4, 69, "Bender A", "Good point. Whattya say we just hit a strip joint?"
4, 69, "Bender 1", "I was waitin' for one of us to say that!  Bender A, you're a prince among robots. Can you forgive me for distrusting you?"
4, 69, "Bender A", "Aw! I can't stay mad at what is essentially me. I love me!"
4, 69, "Amy 1", "This is so great! I always wanted an imaginary friend!"
4, 69, "Amy A", "I'm not imaginary, I'm parallel. We're exactly the same, right down to the--  Splech! Is that pink nail polish?"
4, 69, "Amy 1", "Is that not pink nail polish? The Professor's right, you are evil. And shallow."
4, 69, "Amy A", "I am not evil!"
4, 69, "Leela A", "So, Fry, Leela, how'd you two get together?"
4, 69, "Fry 1", "Funny story. I asked Leela out a million times but she just kept rejecting me."
4, 69, "Leela 1", "I'd make up stuff like ""I have sweaty boot rash"" or ""I have to meet the President""!"
4, 69, "Fry 1", "Oh, man, you never heard such excuses! But, like a dope, I believed her. Looking back on it now, it's kinda funny."
4, 69, "Fry A", "It sure is. Right, Leela? Funny. Ha ha ha ha!"
4, 69, "Leela 1", "Then one night, when Fry asked me out, the only excuse I could think of involved ghosts. I knew he wouldn't buy it, so I did what I always do in those situations."
4, 69, "Leela A", "Oh, Lord..."
4, 69, "Leela 1", "I flipped a coin. It came up heads and we went out."
4, 69, "Fry A", "You mean you flipped a coin too? And it was tails? So that's why you said you had to meet that ghost."
4, 69, "Leela 1", "You really missed out on something, Leela. That date was magical."
4, 69, "Fry 1", "One year later, I gave Leela a diamond scrunchie and we were married."
4, 69, "Leela A", "Ooh!"
4, 69, "Fry A", "One year later, I got beat up at a Neil Diamond concert by a guy named Scrunchie!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "Well, that was pointless."
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "Say, I hope you won't think it ""evil"" of me to ask how you got that stylish head wound."
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "Oh, this old thing? I was experimenting to see if I could remove my own brain."
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "Of course! I had the same idea. I flipped a coin to decide if I should proceed. But it came up tails, so I didn't. How'd it go?"
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "Well getting the brain out was the easy part. The hard part was getting the brain out!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "Oh, you!"
4, 69, "Zoidberg 1", "So, tell me about yourself."
4, 69, "Zoidberg A", "Well, don't look into it, but I'm a respected internal medicine doctor. Ooh! A can!"
4, 69, "Zoidberg 1", "As for me, I design mansions, then live in them.   I'm lying! I'm an appalling failure!"
4, 69, "Zoidberg A", "Me too! A big, fat one!"
4, 69, "Zoidberg 1", "And those co-workers, always looking down on us Zoidbergs. What are they, from Nob Hill?"
4, 69, "Zoidberg A", "They're all like ""Stop spraying me with ink, Zoidberg!"" ""Put on pants, Zoidberg!"" ""Don't touch our fancy box, Zoidberg!"""
4, 69, "Zoidberg 1", "Oh, that box! Too good for us, is it?"
4, 69, "Zoidberg A", "Bah! Someday they'll watch from down in the gutter, they will, as King Zoidberg caresses their fancy box."
4, 69, "Zoidberg 1", "You know, maybe a certain blue lobster saw where Professor hid the box."
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "Good news, everyones!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "After carefully reading the scriptures, we've concluded that none of us are evil."
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "Yes, the Bible is the real good news. Anyhow, you're all free to go back to your own universe."
4, 69, "Hermes 1", "What's goin' on here? Why aren't you all out destroying the Professor's box?"
4, 69, "Leela 1", "Hermes, aren't you curious about the fact that there's two of everybody?"
4, 69, "Hermes 1", "No. Now like my granny used to say back in her tarpaper shack on Montego Bay, ""If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself."""
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "Your granny can go to hell! I've hidden the box so no one can destroy the home universe of my handsome friend here."
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "Oh, go on! Wait a second. If your Hermes was about to destroy the box containing our universe..."
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "Then your Hermes..."
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "Oh, my!"
4, 69, "Narrator", "And sure enough..."
4, 69, "Hermes", "Like Granny said, ""If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself."" God rest her zombie bones."
4, 69, "Leela A", "So we go back through the box and stop Hermes?"
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "Right. Good thing Professor B there hid it in the coelacanth tank. No one but a crazy lobster would look there!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "It's gone!"
4, 69, "Zoidberg A", "All hail Zoidberg, the king with the box!  Now it's my turn, maybe?"
4, 69, "Zoidberg 1", "The box says no."
4, 69, "Narrator", "Meanwhile in Universe A, Hermes A heads towards the sun ... A."
4, 69, "Hermes", "Item one"
4, 69, "Hermes 1", "If I know parallel Hermes, he's at the sun by now."
4, 69, "Bender 1", "Our universe is doomed!"
4, 69, "Bender 1 and Bender A", "Doooooooomed!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "Now don't give up yet, you cry babies. The box is gone but we still have one preposterously slim hope."
4, 69, "Amy A", "Is it a kind of hairspray?"
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "No! We must attempt to make another box containing our universe. Doy!"
4, 69, "Fry 1", "Well? Is that your universe in there?"
4, 69, "Fry A", "Nope. Too cold."
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "Hmm! All women!  I'll put this one aside for later."
4, 69, "Hermes 1", "Oh, man, it's hopeless! We'll never find your universe in time. Plus, this box is stuck on my fat head."
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "Yes, it's the apocalypse alright. I always thought I'd have a hand in it."
4, 69, "Bender 1", "I'm not sad because I finally found someone as great as me. It's like I always say, ""Make new friends and keep the old. One is silver--"""
4, 69, "Bender A", """And the other's gold."""
4, 69, "Zoidberg 1", "Why with the long faces?"
4, 69, "Leela 1", "The idiots have the box!"
4, 69, "Zoidberg A", "I think she means you."
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "Grab them!"
4, 69, "Zoidberg 1", "You coward! Wait for me!"
4, 69, "Amy", "Blug! Which one did they go into?"
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "Oh, let's all ask each other! That'll solve this problem!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "We'll each have to search a universe. Everyone, grab a length of wire first so you can find your way back."
4, 69, "Amy 1", "Hello? Did you see two smelly lobsters?"
4, 69, "Hermes 25", "We didn't see anything ...  ... ever!"
4, 69, "Fry", "Yo! Uh, did two shellfish in scrubs go by?"
4, 69, "Fry 1729", "Hell, no!"
4, 69, "Leela 1729", "Shut up!"
4, 69, "Bender 1729", "Beat it, jerk!"
4, 69, "Leela A", "Uh, have you robot versions of you guys seen any extra Zoidbergs around here?"
4, 69, "Fry 31", "Negative. Will you go out with me?"
4, 69, "Leela A", "Uh, access denied."
4, 69, "Bender 1", "Hey, pal, look what I snagged from the Leprechaun Universe!"
4, 69, "Bender", "Yeah, Leprechaun Universe is fine ... if you haven't seen Pirate Universe!"
4, 69, "Bender 1", "Faith and begorra!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth XVII", "Quae?"
4, 69, "Zoidberg A", "Quick! Into another box!"
4, 69, "Zoidberg 1", "There aren't any in this universe, there aren't. Hey, you, what with the no boxes?"
4, 69, "Farnsworth 420", "Baby, they're somewhere. Everything's like somewhere! Place is kinda au naturel right now."
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "There they are!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "Gotcha!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth 420", "Dig it! All of you fitting in this boxed is like seriously freaked up!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth 1", "Nonsense! Why, there's a whole universe in there."
4, 69, "Farnsworth 420", "Dude, there's a universe in all of us."
4, 69, "Amy 420", "Right on, Professor Freaksworth!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "Get a job!   We've got the box. Everyone, pull your wires."
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "Hurry! Back to Universe A!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth A", "Hermes, don't press that button!"
4, 69, "Hermes", "OK."
4, 69, "Fry A", "Bye."
4, 69, "Leela A", "Good luck, Leela."
4, 69, "Zoidberg A", "So long, Your Majesty!"
4, 69, "Amy 1", "Later!"
4, 69, "Fry", "There but for the flip of a coin go we. So, um, Leela? Seeing how the universe wasn't destroyed, you wanna catch an ape fight? You know, together?"
4, 69, "Leela", "Well, I guess you deserve one more flip."
4, 69, "Fry", "So, heads or tails?"
4, 69, "Leela", "Y'know, let's just say it's heads."
4, 69, "Farnsworth", "Ready?"
4, 69, "Farnsworth", "and  One, two, three, pull!"
4, 69, "Farnsworth", "There. That space-time eversion has given us their box and vice versa."
4, 69, "Leela", "So, what you think you just explained to us is that--"
4, 69, "Farnsworth", "Correct! This box contains our own universe."
4, 69, "Hermes", "Sweet honey bee of infinity!"
4, 69, "Leela", "Bender! Quit destroying the universe!"
4, 69, "Bender", "But--"
4, 69, "Farnsworth", "Yes, all that is and ever shall be is in that box. And the box itself is probably worth something too. We must cherish it, as we cherish every moment of our lives."
4, 70, "Announcer", "This week in the universe.  Dateline, Turantulon 6"
4, 70, "Zapp", "Mmm!"
4, 70, "Nixon", "My fellow Earthicans, after meeting with top voodoo economists, I have decided to refund our silk surplus to you, the taxpayers. That's right! I've sent you each 300 buckaroos in the form of a Tricky Dick Fun Bill. Knock yourselves out!"
4, 70, "Zoidberg", "Money!"
4, 70, "Amy", "I'm slightly richer!"
4, 70, "Bender", "What to do, what to do? One $300 hookerbot or 300 $1 hookerbots?"
4, 70, "Leela", "I'm going to swim with a whale. They're the gentle giants of the deep."
4, 70, "Farnsworth", "I'm well aware of that."
4, 70, "Scruffy", "Scruffy's gonna get himself one of them $300 haircuts. This one's lost its pizzazz!"
4, 70, "Zoidberg", "A fortune, it is! At last Zoidberg will live like a rich man!"
4, 70, "Nixon", "Hey, cut it out! Go away! Get away!"
4, 70, "Amy", "Shmeesh! It's just 300 bucks. What is that, like a hundred cups of coffee?"
4, 70, "Fry", "That's it! I'm getting a hundred cups of coffee. Starting now.  Coffee machine, one cup of coffee, please."
4, 70, "Nixon", "Smells good!"
4, 70, "Zapp", "Leela? Are you there?"
4, 70, "Leela", "No."
4, 70, "Zapp", "Oh, yes, you are! I'm hereby inviting you and your oddball co-workers to a special reception to display the national silk surplus. I believe you know the heroic space stallion who captured it. Show them my medal, Kif."
4, 70, "Kif", "He rented it with his tax refund."
4, 70, "Zapp", "So, Leela, will you have the pleasure?"
4, 70, "Leela", "What little there is to be had."
4, 70, "Zapp", "Tomorrow night at eight them. Smooches!"
4, 70, "Crack Addict", "No cheap crack houses for me no more!"
4, 70, "Man #1", "Very good, sir. Shall I pre-warm sir's crack pipe?"
4, 70, "Amy", "Oh, Kif, it was so romantic of you to rent this paddle plane with your tax rebate. We're like two dandelion seeds wafting on the breeze."
4, 70, "Kif", "Yes. Seeds ... wafting."
4, 70, "Amy", "I almost feel kinda shallow for blowing my rebate on this cool talking tattoo!"
4, 70, "Tattoo #1", "Hey, Gordon Gecko! I cost as much as this whole crummy date!"
4, 70, "Amy", "Shut up!  Ow!"
4, 70, "Farnsworth", "Uh, ma'am, it has become too much of a chore for me to clean out my wrinkles each day. Is it true that stem cells may fight the aging process?"
4, 70, "Geneworks Woman", "Well, yes. In the same way an infant may fight Muhammad Ali. But--"
4, 70, "Farnsworth", "One pound of stem cells, please."
4, 70, "Geneworks Woman", "Of course, any age-reversing effects will be purely temporary."
4, 70, "Bender", "Say, buddy, why's this Grand Cigar so pricey?"
4, 70, "Clerk", "Well, as you can see, its wrapper is a piece of the original US Constitution. It was hand-rolled by Queen Elizabeth during her wild years and was buried with George Burns until graverobbing space mushrooms-- Uh, well you know the rest."
4, 70, "Bender", "Give you 300 bucks for it."
4, 70, "Clerk", "No can do."
4, 70, "Bender", "Oh, alright, I'll just take these $300 burglars tools then."
4, 70, "Clerk", "Very good, sir."
4, 70, "Bender", "So, uh, what time d'you close tonight?"
4, 70, "Dwight", "Hey, Pops! Did that tax rebate come?"
4, 70, "Hermes", "Came and went! You're now the proud owner of Bamboo Boogie Boots.  With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun."
4, 70, "Dwight", "But, Pops, I don't wanna have fun. I wanna be like you; boring but prudently invested."
4, 70, "Hermes", "Babylon's bells! I tallied almost 300 bananas on this entertainment product. Now you put 'em on and have fun."
4, 70, "Dwight", "I don't wanna!"
4, 70, "Hermes", "Well then I'm gonna put 'em on and make you watch me have fun.  See? Fun! Fun--  Dwight! Help me!"
4, 70, "Dwight", "I'll save you, Pops!"
4, 70, "Farnsworth", "Hey! Turn that damn music--  Up!"
4, 70, "Hermes", "Isn't this fun?"
4, 70, "Dwight", "No! I wish I had two mommies!"
4, 70, "Randy", "Try these, uh, sir."
4, 70, "Zoidberg", "I ask for rich guy stuff and you give me shiny pebbles? Bah! I bid you adieu."
4, 70, "Randy", "Ow!"
4, 70, "Leela", "I'd like a pass to swim with Mushu, please."
4, 70, "Whale Biologist", "Well you asked the right guy. I'm the whale biologist. Though personally I hate whales.  Especially Mushu."
4, 70, "Leela", "Then why'd you become a whale biologist?"
4, 70, "Whale Biologist", "I don't know you well enough to get into that. $300, please.  Noon tomorrow. If you're late you only get to tread water in the scallop tank."
4, 70, "Fry", "Uh, I'll have a coffee."
4, 70, "Man #2", "Guppy, trout, mermaid or--"
4, 70, "Fry", "Whale, please."
4, 70, "Kif", "Amy, I-I also spent some of my tax rebate on a gift for you."
4, 70, "Amy", "Oh, Kiffie!"
4, 70, "Kif", "It shows the time wherever we both are. And it's powered by love! Also, you have to wind it."
4, 70, "Tattoo #1", "Oh! Somebody won big at Skeeball!"
4, 70, "Amy", "You shut up! I love it, Kif. I'll use it whenever I wanna know what time it is.  Ooh! It's Fry and Leela!  Hi, Fry and Leela!"
4, 70, "Kif", "Oh! Keep peddling! Oh, for the love of God, keep peddling!"
4, 70, "Amy", "Bye, Fry and Leela!"
4, 70, "Tattoo #1", "Oh, I can't wait until the tattoos on Amy's butt hear about this!"
4, 70, "Tattoo #2", "Hear about what?"
4, 70, "Tattoo #3", "Tell us!"
4, 70, "Amy", "Don't feel sad, my little tadpole."
4, 70, "Kif", "I'm trying not to. But my gift to you is in the belly of a whale."
4, 70, "Zoidberg", "Say, this reminds me of that time I ate that other watch Kif gave you."
4, 70, "Amy", "Hey, it is kinda like that."
4, 70, "Zoidberg", "To induce vomiting, that was the solution. Everywhere it went!  What a Valentine's Day that was!"
4, 70, "Leela", "Hmm. This may seem like a huge coincidence, but I happen to have an in with that whale."
4, 70, "Scruffy", "Scruffy's formulated a plan, but you'll need a ready source of nauseatin' rotten fish."
4, 70, "Elzar", "Freshen your coffee, sir?"
4, 70, "Fry", "Yeah, yeah, yeah! Keep it coming! Put the pot down! Get away!"
4, 70, "April", "You're so young in spirit. It's hard to believe you're as old as 25."
4, 70, "Farnsworth", "The key is to grab life by the hojos! Live every day like it might be your last."
4, 70, "Elzar", "What'll it be, kids?"
4, 70, "Farnsworth", "One bowl of mild farina."
4, 70, "Leela", "Pay dirt!  Hi-yah!"
4, 70, "Elzar", "Here you go, big spender. Foie gras and caviar."
4, 70, "Zoidberg", "Goose liver? Fish eggs?  Pah! Where's the goose? Where's the fish?"
4, 70, "Elzar", "Hey, that's what rich people eat. The garbage parts of the food."
4, 70, "Zoidberg", "I ate garbage yesterday and it didn't cost me $300! I'm not paying.  Farewell, good sir!"
4, 70, "Bender", "Le Grand Cigar! She is mine! And with absolutely no consequences."
4, 70, "Smitty", "You see that?"
4, 70, "URL", "Grand theft tobacco. Time to get off our fat, cop asses and ride!"
4, 70, "Elzar", "Pee-yew! This fish is slightly too rotten to even make jambalaya."
4, 70, "Amy", "So far, so good. Where's Kif?"
4, 70, "Fry", "This isn't Yemeni! It's Sulawesi!  And the cup's shaking! I don't want my coffee shaking!"
4, 70, "Bender", "You seem a tad wound up, buddy. And your face is greasy. Real greasy! You been up all night?"
4, 70, "Fry", "Of course I've been up all night! Not because of caffeine. It was insomnia. I couldn't stop thinking about coffee. I need a nap.  Coffee time!"
4, 70, "Bender", "Ah! Mighty fine smokable!"
4, 70, "Fry", "Fancy cigar. Why don't you smoke it already? Puff, puff! Go, go, go, go, go!"
4, 70, "Bender", "Nah, you can't blow the smoke from such a majestic stogie in just anyone's face. I'm saving it for the fancy-pantses at Zapp Brannigan's black tie reception. You comin'?"
4, 70, "Whale Biologist", "And the fifth reason whales kill is for the sheer fun of it."
4, 70, "Leela", "Anything else?"
4, 70, "Whale Biologist", "Yeah. You're lumpy and you smell awful.  Hey, I calls 'em like I sees 'em! I'm a whale biologist."
4, 70, "Leela", "OK, Mushu, it's feeding time!  Oh, crud! He ate my suit."
4, 70, "Whale Biologist", "The suit was ugly. Whale biologist!"
4, 70, "Caddy", "Perhaps if you tightened your grip, sir?"
4, 70, "Zoidberg", "Ah! Thank you, golf slave.  Bah! Rich people wouldn't waste their time on this nonsense. Plus, these eggs are gritty and tasteless."
4, 70, "Farnsworth", "Ow! Not so rough!"
4, 70, "Whale Biologist", "Ladies and gentlemen, presenting Mushu, the educated whale who thinks he's better than you."
4, 70, "Amy", "C'mon, Mushu! Barf! Barf like a freshman!"
4, 70, "Whale Biologist", "And now, ignorant whale lovers, we'll see who's boss as I make Mushu jump through this hoop. Jump, Mushu!  Who wants a fish?"
4, 70, "Sam", "Mushu is sad!"
4, 70, "URL", "It just keeps comin' and comin'."
4, 70, "Kif", "Wait! That chunk. It's the watch!  I got it, Amy! I got it! The plan went off without a--"
4, 70, "Whale Biologist", "He's got aquarium property! Stop him!"
4, 70, "URL", "Better do what he says. He's a whale biologist."
4, 70, "Smitty", "You're under arrest, you squishy punk!"
4, 70, "Zapp", "The Spiderians, though weak and woman-like on the battlefield, are masters of the textile arts. Taste like king crab, by the way. Crazy bugs actually wove this tapestry of my heroic conquest while I was still killing them."
4, 70, "Zoidberg", "What? It's not even scratch and sniff? But if rich people think it's good, I'll buy it.  One art, please!"
4, 70, "Mom", "What a clever impersonation of a stupid, poor person. How much is that placemat actually worth, Brannigan?"
4, 70, "Zapp", "Exactly $1 billion."
4, 70, "Mom", "Now that's walking-around money!"
4, 70, "Nixon", "What? Hey! Wait! Aroo!"
4, 70, "Whitey", "So I said to Kitty, ""The only way to keep the butler from running away is to cut off his foot.""  Yes, it reminds me of a joke I heard about upper-middle-class people."
4, 70, "Amy", "I've never been sad at a party before. I wonder if my mind is thinking about Kif being in jail."
4, 70, "Scruffy", "Jail's not so bad. You can make sangria in the terlet. Course, it's shank or be shanked."
4, 70, "Amy", "Of course."
4, 70, "Whale Biologist", "Look, just give back our property and we'll drop the charges."
4, 70, "Kif", "Fine, have the watch. It's broken anyway."
4, 70, "Whale Biologist", "I don't want your watch. You're covered in precious ambergris."
4, 70, "Kif", "Precious ... hamburgers?"
4, 70, "Holo-Roseanne", "Ambergris. Noun. A grease-like product of the sperm whales digestive tract that is used as a base in the finest perfumes. This has been Roseanne, your guide to the world of facts."
4, 70, "Whale Biologist", "You heard Roseanne. Scrape off the priceless ambergris and I'll let you go."
4, 70, "Kif", "Or-Or better yet, I'll simply shed my skin."
4, 70, "Morbo", "Stop it! Stop it! It's fine! I will destroy you!"
4, 70, "Farnsworth", "Wha?  Uh, gotta go. Uh, fight club!"
4, 70, "April", "What's happening, Hubie?"
4, 70, "Farnsworth", "I'm afraid the face you fell in love with was actually just a blob of living gunk I bought with my tax refund."
4, 70, "April", "Well as long as we're being honest, I also spent my tax refund on a crazy treatment."
4, 70, "Farnsworth", "That certainly is honest."
4, 70, "April", "It's better for us to both just be ourselves. You, wrinkled as a prune."
4, 70, "Farnsworth", "You, fat as the queen of sea cows."
4, 70, "April", "I love you!"
4, 70, "Farnsworth", "Oh, my!"
4, 70, "Kif", "So, you see, the putrid, waxy substance I was coated with was--"
4, 70, "Amy", "Not precious ambergris!"
4, 70, "Kif", "Yes! And I managed to sneak some out in the usual place. Ta-da!  Using that, I'll make you a perfume of lilac and jasmine and frankenberry."
4, 70, "Amy", "Oh, Kif, it's so romantic I can't even wait! I'm gonna wear it right now."
4, 70, "Mom", "Who smells like freaking porpoise hork?"
4, 70, "Amy", "I do! Kiss me, Kif!"
4, 70, "Zoidberg", "Oh, what a foolish squid I've been. I'm not rich. I can't even buy one measly masterpiece."
4, 70, "Gus", "Pardon us, gent. Might a couple of hungry, hungry hobos take a feed from that aluminum snack box?"
4, 70, "Zoidberg", "So now I'm in the gutter, surrounded by bums who eat garbage? Money brought me no happiness. Bupkiss!"
4, 70, "Dandy Jim", "Ooh! This boot's got a little pudding at the bottom."
4, 70, "Beeler", "Interestingly, the Spiderians are more closely related to our elephants than our spiders."
4, 70, "Hermes", "Don't mind us!"
4, 70, "Nixon", "The loot! The loot! The loot is on fire!"
4, 70, "Zapp", "Leela, my precious rock tub. I'll save you!"
4, 70, "Kif", "Everyone! To the fire door!"
4, 70, "Leela", "It's on fire!"
4, 70, "Farnsworth", "We're trapped, my sweet hippopotamus!"
4, 70, "Fry", "Coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee!"
4, 70, "Dwight", "Where are we, Pops?"
4, 70, "Farnsworth", "Wha?"
4, 70, "April", "What happened to the food?"
4, 70, "Leela", "I think we were saved by a mysterious orange blur."
4, 70, "Zoidberg", "Welcome, one and all. I finally figured out how money could make me happy. By using it to buy my hungry friends a feast."
4, 70, "Dandy Jim", "Everyone join us. Oysters Rockefeller here has provided genuine turkey dogs!"
4, 70, "Whitey", "Heck, you're never too rich to enjoy a free turkey dog."
4, 70, "Amy", "Yeah!"
4, 70, "Bender", "Alright! Turkey dog!"
4, 70, "April", "I'll take four!"
4, 70, "Leela", "Me too!"
4, 70, "Mom", "Oh, what the hell."
4, 70, "Hermes", "Here, Dwight. The boots only cost $299.99. You invest this penny like you wanted."
4, 70, "Dwight", "Thanks, Dad. I'm gonna take this and buy five shares of Amazon.com."
4, 70, "Hermes", "A risk-taker? That's my boy!"
4, 70, "Nixon", "The entire surplus is gone! Oh, what a McGovern I've been! Why did I have to issue that crooked tax rebate?"
4, 70, "Leela", "At least we got a few mildly interesting stories out of it."
4, 70, "Farnsworth", "Oh, my, yes."
4, 70, "Bender", "Speaking of which, my story kinda petered out without me learning a lesson."
4, 70, "Smitty", "There he is!"
4, 70, "Bender", "Alright! Closure!"
4, 70, "Holo-Roseanne", "Futurama. Noun. Um, I don't know, you just watched it, dummy. What are you asking me for? Hey, here's a fun definition"
4, 71, "John DiMaggio", "Prepare for the stereophonic experience."
4, 71, "Bender", "Aw, New New York City! Woooo! Woooo! Don' worry about it! Do the robot, baby!"
4, 71, "Farnsworth", "Oh, Lord! Hiking is always such a strain on the buttocks."
4, 71, "Fry", "Shh! What was that sound?"
4, 71, "Bender", "It wasn't a bird's nest falling. That sounds like this.  Aww, they're so cute when they're scared."
4, 71, "Fry", "I meant the sound Bigfoot just made. He's been sighted a lot in this area recently. Just last week, a blind hiker felt him."
4, 71, "Farnsworth", "Don't tell me you actually believe in Bigfoot, you blathering ninny-hammer."
4, 71, "Fry", "Of course I do! Bigfoot's my hero. Growing up, he was the celebrity I most identified with."
4, 71, "Zoidberg", "Why?"
4, 71, "Fry", "'Cause he was a loner who hated the popular monsters yet longed to be one."
4, 71, "Zoidberg", "I can so relate to that."
4, 71, "Leela", "Ugh! Enough emotions! This isn't a fat camp, for God's sake.  Although you wouldn't know it from looking."
4, 71, "Zoidberg", "Bender, if you want to sleep in the tent tonight, you're welcome to join me and Hermes for a little ""just friends"" spooning."
4, 71, "Bender", "Nah, I'm comfy out here under the stars.  Real comfy!"
4, 71, "Ranger Park", "Hey, I'm Ranger Park, the park ranger."
4, 71, "Fry", "I get it!"
4, 71, "Ranger Park", "Now since this area's a national Bigfoot preserve, we'll start with a short film about Bigfoot while I make a few phone calls."
4, 71, "Narrator", "Bigfoot ...  ... Endangered Mystery!  In the dense forests of the Pacific Northwest ...  ... dwells the strange and beautiful creature known as Bigfoot, perhaps."
4, 71, "Fry", "That proves it!"
4, 71, "Narrator", "Sadly, logging and human settlement today threaten what might possibly be his habitat. Although if it's not, they don't. Bigfoot populations require vast amounts of land to remain elusive in.  They typically dwell just behind rocks but are also sometimes playful, bounding into thick fogs and out-of-focus areas."
4, 71, "Ranger Park", "It should say ""Top Quality Exercycle For Sale"" and could you put ""top quality"" in bold? You can't? OK, whatever."
4, 71, "Narrator", "Remember, it's up to us. Bigfoot is a crucial part of the ecosystem, if he exists. So let's all help keep Bigfoot possibly alive for future generations to enjoy unless he doesn't exist. The end."
4, 71, "Ranger Park", "I-I gotta call you back.  Alright, questions?"
4, 71, "Sal", "Yeah. Have yous ever seens Bigfeet?"
4, 71, "Ranger Park", "Technically, no. But I do see him each night in my dreams and each day in the smiling faces of hairy children."
4, 71, "Farnsworth", "Bunk! Bunk I say! Bring me a bag full of Bigfoot's droppings or shut up!"
4, 71, "Ranger Park", "I have the droppings of someone who saw Bigfoot."
4, 71, "Farnsworth", "Shut up!"
4, 71, "Bender", "Oh, my God! Look! It's Bigfoot!"
4, 71, "Ranger Park", "Where?"
4, 71, "Bender", "Eh, he's gone. He said you should keep wasting your life though."
4, 71, "Petunia", "Oh! I saw Bigfoot crushing cars at the county fair."
4, 71, "Ranger Park", "What you saw was Bigfoot the monster truck. But thanks for a great question."
4, 71, "Fry", "Sir, if I may, why don't you just set up like a billion video cameras in the woods and see if he walks by one?"
4, 71, "Ranger Park", "Ah, that would be very expensive, and most people who believe in Bigfoot are broke."
4, 71, "Bender", "Hey, look! Bigfoot! He's back!"
4, 71, "Ranger Park", "Where?"
4, 71, "Bender", "Up your face!  Everybody do the Bender!"
4, 71, "Amy", "The sky out here is amazing. Look at all those satellites."
4, 71, "Farnsworth", "Goodnight, employees."
4, 71, "Hermes", "Goodnight."
4, 71, "Zoidberg", "Goodnight, Hubert."
4, 71, "Fry", "You doin' alright out there, buddy?"
4, 71, "Bender", "Better than these gnats!  That guy won't be goin' home to his kids."
4, 71, "Bender", "Who's that? A wolf? Or some kind of boogen? Oh, God, I wish I was safe inside a tent.   Fry! Fry wake up! It's me, Bigface!"
4, 71, "Bender", "Come out and groom my mangy fur!"
4, 71, "Fry", "Huh? Bigfoot? You taught yourself English?"
4, 71, "Fry", "Bigfoot? Bigfoot?"
4, 71, "Fry", "Bigfoot? Is that you? I'm not like the others, Bigfoot; I see through your monster coatings to the gentle loner inside. I bet you have a wounded racoon friend that you tenderly nurse back to health while you go...  But in the end they shoot you. But you teach us about things.  Oh. Just a flying saucer.  Excuse me? You can't park here. The parking area's over there.  Wow! Nice tube.  Hey! Hey, what's the big idea? Stop abducting me. Why does your vanity plate say ""Probe 1""?"
4, 71, "Leela", "There's nothing so refreshing as the clean, crisp taste of this bold Canadian beer."
4, 71, "Hermes", "Well, see you in an hour. I gotta go do some business behind that tree."
4, 71, "Amy", "Bender, wasn't that Fry's tent?"
4, 71, "Bender", """Bender""!"
4, 71, "Leela", "Bender raises a good point"
4, 71, "Fry", "Amy, you won't believe what happened ...  ... it was so scary that you wouldn't--  I know, but listen, it gets even scarier."
4, 71, "Farnsworth", "Fry! What in Sega Genesis happened to you?"
4, 71, "Fry", "That's what I'm trying to tell you. See--  Why are you all staring at me like that? Is there something on my face?"
4, 71, "Hermes", "Uh ... no."
4, 71, "Leela", "Someone should tell him."
4, 71, "Fry", "Tell me what?"
4, 71, "Leela", "Nothing."
4, 71, "Zoidberg", "Well I have a lot of experience telling patients bad news, so let me break it to him gently.   Fry, you have no nose! Your nose is gone! You have no nose on your face! Where it is I can't say but on your face it's not!"
4, 71, "Fry", "What?"
4, 71, "Bender", "Aww! I think it's sweet. You chopped off your nose so you could look more like your hero. Me, Bender!"
4, 71, "Fry", "My God! They must have taken it last night."
4, 71, "Farnsworth", "Which last night?"
4, 71, "Fry", "In the woods. I was walking ... for Bigfoot, looking ... and then aliens beamed me up."
4, 71, "Amy", "Were they little grey dudes with big oval heads?  I don't get that gesture. Am I wrong?"
4, 71, "Zoidberg", "Cheer up, friend. When we get home a high-quality prosthesis will have you looking good as new."
4, 71, "Fry", "I'm a pathetic freak. My life is ruined."
4, 71, "Hermes", "Man, you are such a jokester!"
4, 71, "Fry", "I'll never have another moment of happiness."
4, 71, "Leela", "I know you're trying to mask your pain with humour, but don't worry. I'm sure the Professor can clone you a new nose."
4, 71, "Fry", "Eh, it wouldn't be the same. I want my nose. I don't want to have to teach a new one how to shoot milk when I laugh."
4, 71, "Farnsworth", "Well there's no sense fretting. Good Lord, you're ugly! The fact is your nose is gone and we'll never find out who did it or why."
4, 71, "Bender", "Guys! Guys! There's something on television."
4, 71, "Linda", "Alien abductions"
4, 71, "Fry", "Like me!"
4, 71, "Morbo", "The culprits"
4, 71, "Linda", "The valuable nose, or ""human horn"", fetches a high price on alien worlds as an aphrodisiac."
4, 71, "Fry", "My nose is an aphrodisiac?  I'm gonna drop a barf!"
4, 71, "Morbo", "Demand for human horn is great, due, in part, to titillating scenes from depraved alien TV programmes too filthy for Earth broadcast. Let's watch."
4, 71, "Neptunian Woman", "Human horn? But ... it is forbidden!"
4, 71, "Neptunian Man", "So is our love."
4, 71, "Fry", "Blech! We have to track down my nose before some alien snarfs it and does the worm. Who's in?"
4, 71, "Leela", "Me and Bender and maybe Zoidberg if he feels like it."
4, 71, "Zoidberg", "No, I'm good."
4, 71, "Alien", "Let's see, I'll take a pancreas, two sphincters and a large Coke."
4, 71, "Vendor", "One number three combo!"
4, 71, "Fry", "It's no use. We've been to every scuzzy bazaar in the galaxy, including Pottery Barn."
4, 71, "Leela", "Wait. What's that?"
4, 71, "Salesman", "Welcome, friends. How may I pervert you?"
4, 71, "Fry", "Uh, I'm looking for human horn."
4, 71, "Salesman", "Shh! You're not cops, right?"
4, 71, "Leela", "Of course not. In fact, he's a crook."
4, 71, "Bender", "Yep. Stolen Pez anyone?"
4, 71, "Salesman", "Right this way."
4, 71, "Salesman", "Human horn. So fresh you can still see the eyeglass marks."
4, 71, "Fry", "Nope. Uh-uh. Ew!  Now look. This is the nose we want. Did you sell it to somebody?"
4, 71, "Salesman", "I'm sorry, sir, but due to the perverted nature of our business, customer records are strictly confidential.  Right this way."
4, 71, "Salesman", "I video-tape everyone who comes in here so I can blackmail them later.  Hey, I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Here's the weirdo who bought your horn."
4, 71, "Leela", "That's Lrrr! Ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8."
4, 71, "Lrrr", "You got any, uh, you know, uh  human horn?"
4, 71, "Salesman", "Speak up! You're muttering!"
4, 71, "Lrrr", "I said, uh  human horn?"
4, 71, "Salesman", "You're not a cop, right?"
4, 71, "Lrrr", "Oh, no, no. I'm just some guy ... ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8!"
4, 71, "Lrrr", "So let me get this straight"
4, 71, "Bender", "Yep. That's exactly the lie we used to get past your guards."
4, 71, "Fry", "Oh, great space king, I humbly beg you to return my human horn."
4, 71, "Lrrr", "Uh, human horn? How ridiculous! Why would a virile male like Lrrr need human horn? I don't even know what it's for. What is it, something you-you put in salad dressing?"
4, 71, "Nd-Nd", "Like you've ever seen a salad."
4, 71, "Lrrr", "My weight is appropriate and attractive!"
4, 71, "Leela", "Whoa! You guys have issues."
4, 71, "Lrrr", "She has issues! I'm fine! But there's no human horn around here, so make friends with the door."
4, 71, "Fry", "Alright. I give up. I guess I'll just go home and marry a skunk."
4, 71, "Nd-Nd", "Oh, let's just give it to him.  Here."
4, 71, "Fry", "My nose! Light of my face!"
4, 71, "Lrrr", "Uh, what is that? How do you have that, Nd-Nd?  I've never seen it before. My friend left it here."
4, 71, "Leela", "Hold still, Fry. I can reattach it with my emergency face laser."
4, 71, "Fry", "Hey! You burned my cheek!"
4, 71, "Leela", "Yeah, sorry, I wasn't really concentrating."
4, 71, "Fry", "No, I mean the singed flesh, I can smell it!  And those lilacs on the table."
4, 71, "Lrrr", "At least someone noticed."
4, 71, "Nd-Nd", "For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your first wife was the one who liked lilacs."
4, 71, "Lrrr", "She also liked to shut up!"
4, 71, "Fry", "Well, great seeing you. I guess we'll be on our--"
4, 71, "Bender", "Yo, Highness. Uh, just out of robo-curiosity, why would you use a guy's nose for an aphrodisiac instead of his, you know, wing-dang-doodle?"
4, 71, "Lrrr", "But, uh, I thought the horn was the human wing-dang-doodle."
4, 71, "Bender", "No, sir, chief! The main event, so to speak, is downstairs near the wallet. Ever seen soccer players line up to block a free kick? They ain't covering their noses, I'll tell you that much. Well, see you!"
4, 71, "Lrrr", "Interesting. The trousers conceal a tiny secondary horn."
4, 71, "Fry", "Hey, what've you heard?"
4, 71, "Lrrr", "Guards! Seize him!  Prepare to harvest the lower horn!"
4, 71, "Fry", "OK, you can have my nose."
4, 71, "Lrrr", "Guards!"
4, 71, "Guard #1", "Yeah?"
4, 71, "Lrrr", "Remove the human's lower horn and prepare it to be eaten by me."
4, 71, "Nd-Nd", "In other words, slop a lot of ketchup and salt on it."
4, 71, "Lrrr", "Then bring it to our royal bedchamber and put it in the sock drawer with all the other things that have failed to arouse my passion for this woman."
4, 71, "Guard #2", "Remove pants!"
4, 71, "Fry", "Wait! Listen. I'm usually the first guy to toot my own lower horn--"
4, 71, "Bender", "I'll say!"
4, 71, "Fry", "But in this case I-I just don't think it'll do any good."
4, 71, "Bender", "That's what she said!"
4, 71, "Leela", "Let's face it, you two have deep relationship problems that can't be solved by an aphrodisiac."
4, 71, "Fry", "However huge it might be."
4, 71, "Nd-Nd", "So what do you suggest, painfully-single human?"
4, 71, "Leela", "Well, why don't you think back to what brought you together in the first place?"
4, 71, "Nd-Nd", "Oh, I don't know. Lrrr used to be so tender."
4, 71, "Lrrr", "I only wrote that poem to test my printer."
4, 71, "Nd-Nd", "We'd go walking in the woods and Lrrr would find injured little tinkle-bunnies and nurse them back to health."
4, 71, "Lrrr", "Yes, but I'm the one who injured them!"
4, 71, "Nd-Nd", "Oh, shush. You stepped on them by accident and then you cried all night. That's the kind of sensitive man you used to be."
4, 71, "Lrrr", "And you used to wear a size-3 cape.  But not anymore! Now bring me that lower horn while I'm still in the mood."
4, 71, "Fry", "Wh-What if we helped you get your passion back without the hassle of mutilating me?"
4, 71, "Leela", "Yeah, we know a great place in the mountains. We could take you there for a romantic dinner under the stars."
4, 71, "Nd-Nd", "Hmm. Sounds interesting. But he would never do it."
4, 71, "Lrrr", "Like hell I wouldn't. I'm not gonna be blamed for not going."
4, 71, "Fry", "Then it's a deal. We get one night. I keep my horn as long as you two end up doing the horizontal monster mash."
4, 71, "Bender", "I don't get it!"
4, 71, "Bender", "Bonjour. May I offer you a box of wine for the edge of the table?"
4, 71, "Lrrr", "No, thanks. Just water, please. Tap water!"
4, 71, "Nd-Nd", "Oh, big spender!"
4, 71, "Lrrr", "That's it! This date is over. Waiter!"
4, 71, "Fry", "So, what can I get you this evening?"
4, 71, "Lrrr", "Your lower horn!"
4, 71, "Fry", "I'll just start you off with some bread. Some sexy, arousing bread!"
4, 71, "Lrrr", "Fine! But none of that whole-grain goat food. And bring plenty of melted butter."
4, 71, "Nd-Nd", "Why don't you just inject some fat straight into your ass and cut out the middle man?"
4, 71, "Lrrr", "One of these days, Nd-Nd. Bang! Zoom! Straight to the third moon of Omicron Persei 8!"
4, 71, "Lrrr", "Mmm! This jerked chicken is good. I think I'll have Fry's lower horn jerked."
4, 71, "Bender", "It's used to it!"
4, 71, "Fry", "So, uh, how are you two snooky-poopums doing?"
4, 71, "Nd-Nd", "Poorly."
4, 71, "Lrrr", "My wife is right, for once. There's very little magic in the air. Ready the lower horn transport vessel."
4, 71, "Bender", "Boy, who knew a cooler could also make a handy wang coffin?  Hey, uh, mind if I stick these in here?"
4, 71, "Guard #1", "Go for it."
4, 71, "Leela", "Don't worry, Fry. Things look bad but I still have a trump card; the most beautiful love song ever written.(singing badly) And I will always love you,Will always love you."
4, 71, "Nd-Nd", "The humans are attacking!"
4, 71, "Lrrr", "Pluck the lower horn and let's get out of here!"
4, 71, "Bender", "Quick, Fry! Run for it!"
4, 71, "Fry", "Come on, freedom cage! Roll me to safety!  Yes! I never thought I'd escape with my doodle, but I pulled it out!"
4, 71, "Bender", "Just like at the movie theatre!"
4, 71, "Lrrr", "Give me that!"
4, 71, "Fry", "Bigfoot! He's real! I knew it! The Loch Ness Monster's book was right!"
4, 71, "Lrrr", "Well, hello there, my furry friend."
4, 71, "Nd-Nd", "Look at his adorable little feet.  Yes, you are a cutie-pie."
4, 71, "Ranger Park", "Holy macaroni!  I can't believe I'm seeing Bigfoot! He's in focus! Oh, I've waited my entire life for this moment."
4, 71, "Nd-Nd", "What?"
4, 71, "Bender", "What are you doing with that?"
4, 71, "Lrrr", "You're going to kill this innocent giganto?"
4, 71, "Ranger Park", "Of course not. I'm just gonna tranquilize him so I can chop off his feet as proof he exists. Then dump him back in the wild. He'll do fine."
4, 71, "Lrrr", "You'll have to get through me first."
4, 71, "Ranger Park", "OK. Nighty night!"
4, 71, "Lrrr", "Now leave this gentle Sasquatch, or Wood Ape, in peace so I can finally and at long last harvest this pathetic human's lower horn."
4, 71, "Fry", "Yeah!"
4, 71, "Lrrr", "Wait. What am I saying? If I poach this beast's lower horn, am I any better than that ranger with his demented foot lust? Yes. But not by enough."
4, 71, "Ranger Park", "Score!"
4, 71, "Lrrr", "This human's lower horn is one of God's creatures, a living thing, and all living things, large and small--"
4, 71, "Bender", "In this case ""small""!"
4, 71, "Lrrr", "Have dignity and a spark of the divine."
4, 71, "Nd-Nd", "That's the gentle, sensitive, poet warlord I fell in love with."
4, 71, "Lrrr", "Uh, you'll wanna retreat to a safe, 500-metre radius!"
4, 71, "Leela", "Well, Fry, it looks like you get to hold onto your lower horn."
4, 71, "Bender", "As usual!   Run away!"
4, 71, "Narrator", "You're on a scenic route through a state recreation known as the human mind. You ask a passer-by for directions, only to find he has no face or something. Suddenly, up ahead, a door in the road. You swerve, narrowly avoiding The Scary Door."
4, 71, "Scientist", "I have combined the DNA of the world's most evil animals to make the most evil creature of them all."
4, 71, "Man", "It turns out it's Man."
4, 72, "Bender", "Huh?  I choose to not understand these signs."
4, 72, "Bender", "Aha!"
4, 72, "Fry", "Bender? I was just not playing the holophonor."
4, 72, "Bender", "Yeah, well you should try not stinking at it."
4, 72, "Fry", "I am trying. I've been taking lessons."
4, 72, "Bender", "Lessons? Oh, that's rich! Isn't it time you gave up all hope of ever improving yourself in any way?"
4, 72, "Fry", "I know I should but I just can't. Remember when I had those stomach worms that made me smart? I could play the holophonor and it made Leela like me.  Hey, Bender, as long as you know, I have a holophonor recital Tuesday. I'd really like to have somebody there. Please?"
4, 72, "Bender", "Fine, I'll go already. Y'know, sometimes I wish your real parents were still alive. Not often, though."
4, 72, "Bender", "Whoa! Hey!"
4, 72, "Fry", "Uh, hello, Mrs. Mellonger."
4, 72, "Mrs. Mellonger", "Hello, Philip.  And you must be Mr. Bender. Philip's told me so much about you. Is it true that you're a robot?"
4, 72, "Bender", "I prefer the term ""love machine""."
4, 72, "Bender", "Wow! Your kid is great. How hard did you say you had to hit him?"
4, 72, "Mother", "Fairly hard."
4, 72, "Fry", "The Grumpy Snail.  Sorry!"
4, 72, "Boy", "It's too grumpy!"
4, 72, "Fry", "Ow! No! Quit it! Stop!"
4, 72, "Mrs. Mellonger", "Mr. Bender, I simply cannot teach your child."
4, 72, "Bender", "Then good day, madam!  We hope to see you soon for tea."
4, 72, "Fry", "It's hopeless! I can hear all this great music in my head but my stupid hands can't keep up."
4, 72, "Bender", "Aww. You know what always cheers me up? Laughing at other people's misfortunes."
4, 72, "Leela", "Hey, guys. You missed a great delivery to Space Earth. Where you been all afternoon?"
4, 72, "Fry", "At, uh, uh, a concert."
4, 72, "Leela", "Ooh! Was it jazz noodling? My ex-boyfriend Sean played the sax. I used to listen for hours while he sat naked on my couch and improvised."
4, 72, "Bender", "So musicians really Rodger your Hammerstein, huh?"
4, 72, "Leela", "Yeah, it's weird; Sean was uneducated, unambitious. He was pastey and hunched--"
4, 72, "Fry", "Pretty boy."
4, 72, "Leela", "But when he played I could sense this incredible, beautiful creative soul. Then one day I found someone else's couch fibres on his butt.  I couldn't believe it. I was really..."
4, 72, "Fry", "That could be my beautiful soul sitting naked on her couch if I could just learn to play this stupid thing."
4, 72, "Bender", "Oh, but you can. Though you may have to metaphorically make a ""deal with the devil"". And by ""devil"" I mean ""Robot Devil"". And by ""metaphorically"" I mean ""get your coat""."
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "You hit a sour note about 200 years back, Doug!  Let's take it from the top.  Ah, Bender, Fry. You've come back for more eternal damnation."
4, 72, "Bender", "No, this isn't a religious visit. Fry just wants holophonor lessons."
4, 72, "Fry", "Yep. I need to get really good without practising."
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Hell is full of ten-year-olds who wanted exactly the same thing. Trouble is, you have what my old music teacher, Mrs. Mellonger, calls ""stupid fingers"".  With hands like that you'll be lucky to master a belt buckle.  Now wouldn't it be nice if you had a pair of robot hands to replace them?"
4, 72, "Fry", "Sure would.  Oh, well. Goodbye."
4, 72, "Bender", "Fry, you smelly idiot, I think he's willing to make some kind of deal with the devil with you."
4, 72, "Fry", "He-He-He is?  Great! Wait, what's the catch?"
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "No catch. I'll merely pick a robot at random from somewhere in the universe, probably one you've never even met, and then I'll remove his hands and switch them for yours.  It's just the sort of guy I am. What do you say?"
4, 72, "Fry", "I don't know. It doesn't seem entirely moral to--"
4, 72, "Bender", "Fry, if you don't take this offer right now I will lose all respect for you and punch you."
4, 72, "Fry", "Well, alright. You sure I probably won't know him?"
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Definitely probably not.  Just sign this contract."
4, 72, "Bender", "Wow!"
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "And here we go!"
4, 72, "Bender", "I got a hundred bucks on Rectal-Exambot!"
4, 72, "Fry", "Robot Devil? I get your hands? Zam!"
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Oh, what an appallingly ironic outcome."
4, 72, "Bender", "It's not ironic, it's just coincidental. Now fork over those lady-fingers, Cookie!"
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Y'know, I only put my name on there as a show of good faith for the other robots."
4, 72, "Fry", "Stop being such a baby and chop my hands off."
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Oh, very well."
4, 72, "Fry", "How'd you do that?"
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "They're very good hands."
4, 72, "Fry", "At last! At last I have the power to make Leela love me."
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Oh, sorry. That'll wear off in a couple of days."
4, 72, "Fry", "Check it out, everyone. I'm back from hell and I've got the Robot Devil's hands."
4, 72, "Amy", "Neat! Let's see a trick."
4, 72, "Fry", "Alrighty!"
4, 72, "Scruffy", "Somebody called the Robot Devil's here to see somebody called Fry."
4, 72, "Fry", "Uh-oh."
4, 72, "Bender", "Where'd I go just now?"
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Hello, Fry.  Just dropped by to make sure you're as happy with our little deal as I am.  Give me back my hands! These things are always touching me in places."
4, 72, "Fry", "Yeah, they get around! But I'm afraid we had a deal."
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Looks like I wasted a bus trip."
4, 72, "Fry", "Yes, you did."
4, 72, "Grumpy Snail", "Yes. Now you can hear holophonor virtuoso Philip Fry play 900 of these classic themes in your own home on this two-record set.  That's over 30 minutes of music for only $14.99."
4, 72, "Zoidberg", "Only $14.99 for a two-record set. Two records! Oh, Zoidberg, at last you're becoming a crafty consumer!"
4, 72, "Man", "Hello?"
4, 72, "Zoidberg", "Hello? I'll take eight!"
4, 72, "Scruffy", "Mr. Hedonismbot to see you."
4, 72, "Fry", "Uh, show him in."
4, 72, "Scruffy", "Very good, sir."
4, 72, "Hedonismbot", "Ah, Fry. Congratulations. Your latest performance was as delectable as dipping my bottom over and over into a bath of the silkiest oils and creams."
4, 72, "Fry", "Thank you, sir. That's exactly what I was going for."
4, 72, "Hedonismbot", "You were the sole diversion in what has been a pale and unamusing season. And so I would fain commission you write an opera."
4, 72, "Fry", "But I've never written an opera."
4, 72, "Hedonismbot", "And I've never heard one. Still, if you can keep me amused through the overture I shall consider it a smashing success."
4, 72, "Fry", "But I wouldn't even know what to write about. Unless...  OK, I'll do it. If I can make it about Leela."
4, 72, "Leela", "Me? Really?"
4, 72, "Hedonismbot", "A man writing an opera about a woman?  Oh, sirrah, how deliciously absurd!  I shall see you at the premiere."
4, 72, "Leela", "Is it part of the opera?"
4, 72, "Fry", "Leela!  You shouldn't be listening. I don't want you to hear it till it's done."
4, 72, "Leela", "But it's so beautiful."
4, 72, "Fry", "So's a peacock but you don't eat it until it's cooked. This has to be perfect. I want you to hear exactly what I hear when I think about you."
4, 72, "Leela", "Oh, Fry. All this time you've had this incredible gift and I never knew. I've been a fool. A fully-justified, prudent fool.  They're so cold."
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "And yet hell is so hot!  Can I have my hands back now?"
4, 72, "Fry", "No!"
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "You're not nice!"
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Ah, Bender, this is a surprise! For you! Finding me in the refrigerator."
4, 72, "Bender", "True, but at least I don't have the hiccups anymore. What up?"
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Oh, well it so happens I'm in the mood to make a deal with you."
4, 72, "Bender", "Forget it! You can't tempt me."
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Really? There's nothing you want?"
4, 72, "Bender", "Hm. I forgot you could tempt me with things I want.  Well, I suppose I've always wondered what it would be like to be more annoying."
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Nothing simpler! And all I ask in return is your hands.  To replace these bony hotdogs!"
4, 72, "Bender", "Grabby and Squeezy? Never! I love these guys!"
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Well is there anything else you would part with?"
4, 72, "Bender", "No. Nothing. Ain't gonna happen."
4, 72, "Bender", "Yes! With this built-in stadium airhorn I can really annoy people. And all it cost me was my crotch-plate."
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "You certainly are a shrewd businessman, Bender.  Now find someone and give 'em a good blast!"
4, 72, "Bender", "Yeah! That'll teach the first person I see a lesson."
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Ah, my ridiculously circuitous plan is one-quarter complete!"
4, 72, "Leela", "Well, Fry's opera premiere's tomorrow night. I'm off to find a pair of formal gloves that'll fit over my enormous forearms."
4, 72, "Bender", "Pretty annoying, huh, Leela?"
4, 72, "Leela", "What? Are you talking? Oh, God! I'm deaf!"
4, 72, "Bender", "Oops. I'm so, so sorry, Leela. I just wanted to annoy you."
4, 72, "Leela", "What? Oh, this is horrible. I won't be able to hear Fry's opera."
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Ah, how delightfully ironic."
4, 72, "Bender", "It's not ironic, it's just mean. Take this!"
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Ooh! Out of aerosol? Also ironic!"
4, 72, "Bender", "Oh, yeah? Well bite my shiny metal--   Oh, nooo!"
4, 72, "Leela", "Nobody tell Fry I'm deaf. If he found out I couldn't hear his opera, it'd break his heart."
4, 72, "Bender", "OK, deaf-o!"
4, 72, "Hedonismbot", "Courtesans and gentle fops, I bid you welcome to my opera. Let us cavort like the Greeks of old.  You know the ones I mean."
4, 72, "Leela", "Yay, Fry!"
4, 72, "Zoidberg", "I watch TV with that guy!"
4, 72, "Holo-Vogel", "Who is this one-eyed female baby Moses,With courage in her female baby smile?"
4, 72, "Holo-Orphans", "A saviour from the stars,Or something stranger still."
4, 72, "Holo-Leela", "Or just a lonely, filthy, starving child."
4, 72, "Leela", "Amy, Fry's looking at me. What am I s'posed to be feeling?  Ah!"
4, 72, "Holo-Bender", "Leela! Leela, Leela save him!Save Fry, save Fry,Godzilla will devour him,As for me,I must be off,To have my doctor check this cough,Goodbye!"
4, 72, "Bender", "I don't recall ever fighting Godzilla, but that is so what I would have done."
4, 72, "Amy", "One diet double Martini, please."
4, 72, "Bartender", "And for you, sir?"
4, 72, "Hermes", "I'll just have a Shirley Hemple."
4, 72, "Tinny Tim", "Extra! Extra! World's greatest opera only half over."
4, 72, "Leela", "Half over? Oh, I'd give anything to hear the rest."
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Anything?  Thank you, sir.  Now, as I was saying, anything? Because I can give you new robotic ears!"
4, 72, "Leela", "What? You can give me new ears? Wait. What seemingly reasonable thing do you want in return?"
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Just your hands, my dear."
4, 72, "Leela", "Whatever you said, forget it!"
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Alright then, just one hand."
4, 72, "Leela", "Just ... my left hand? Um, uh--"
4, 72, "Announcer", "Please take your seats for act two."
4, 72, "Hedonismbot", "But I'm not done vomiting."
4, 72, "Leela", "I can't stand it!  OK. You can have my hand."
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Wonderful!  Just sign here.  Calculon, old friend, I'm afraid I need your ears."
4, 72, "Calculon", "Well I do owe you for giving me this unholy  acting talent."
4, 72, "Leela", "I can hear! I can hear like a safecracker! Hey, aren't you gonna take my hand?"
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "In good time. You go enjoy the opera."
4, 72, "Holo-Fry", "To win Leela's heart with the holophonors art,I need hands of transcendental quickness."
4, 72, "Holo-Robot Devil", "Well I don't see any danger,In gambling with a stranger,For my head is of a most amazing thickness."
4, 72, "Holo-Robot Devil", "I'm stupid, I'm stupid,I'm stupider than you,I'm stupider than you in every way."
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Stupider? Pah! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant!  Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry."
4, 72, "Fry", "Look, what do you want?"
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "I want my hands back."
4, 72, "Fry", "Never!(singing) A deal's a deal,Even with a dirty dealer."
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Very well,Then I'll take what I want from Leela."
4, 72, "Leela", "Whoa!"
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "Leela has promised me her hand."
4, 72, "Leela", "Fry, you do not understand."
4, 72, "Leela", "I should have revealed I've been deafened by Bender,The shame,The shame,But I feared you'd stop writing this musical splendour,Deception's the curse of my whimsical gender,He gave me mechanical ears,Effective though just a bit garish,In return without shedding a tear,I agreed that I'd give him my hand--"
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "In marriage!"
4, 72, "Leela", "What?"
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "You'd give me your hand in marriage."
4, 72, "Hermes", "Is this really happening or just being staged?"
4, 72, "Farnsworth", "It can't be real--"
4, 72, "Amy", "Not if Leela is engaged."
4, 72, "Leela", "That isn't what I meant,That isn't what I signed."
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "You should have checked the wording in the fine...  Print."
4, 72, "Leela", "I'll give you my hand..."
4, 72, "Leela", "and   In marriage."
4, 72, "Bender", "The use of words expressing something other than their literal intention,Now that is ""irony""."
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "I will marry her now and confine her to hell,How droll,How droll!Where Styx is a river,And not just a band,Though they'll play our reception if all goes as planned,Unless, Fry, you surrender my hands!"
4, 72, "Fry", "Destiny has cheated me,By forcing me to decide upon,The woman that I idolise,Or the hands of an automaton,Without these hands I can't complete,The opera that was captivating her,But if I keep them,And she marries him,Then he probably won't want me dating her."
4, 72, "Nixon", "Arooo!"
4, 72, "Zapp", "Bray-vo! Enn-core!"
4, 72, "Farnsworth", "I can't believe the devil is so unforgiving."
4, 72, "Zoidberg", "I can't believe everybody's just ad-libbing!"
4, 72, "Preacherbot", "By the power vested in me,By the state of New New York--"
4, 72, "Fry", "No!  Stop! Take my hands!(singing) You evil, metal dork!"
4, 72, "Hedonismbot", "Surgery in an opera? How wonderfully decadent and just as I was beginning to lose interest.  Jombey! The chocolate icing!  Oh! Oh, my!"
4, 72, "Fry", "My hands. My horrible human hands.  And what did you do to my nails?"
4, 72, "Robot Devil", "I cleaned them. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's my poker night and I feel lucky.  So it's back to hell for me. Come on, Nixon!"
4, 72, "Nixon", "Huh?"
4, 72, "Hedonismbot", "Less reality, more fantasy. Resume the opera."
4, 72, "Fry", "But I can't play anymore."
4, 72, "Zoidberg", "Yes you can! The beauty was in your heart, not your hands.  The music's bad and you should feel bad."
4, 72, "Fry", "Whoa! Hey!"
4, 72, "Tinny Tim", "Extra! Extra! Greatest opera of all time sucks."
4, 72, "Zoidberg", "I'll take eight!"
4, 72, "Leela", "Please don't stop playing, Fry. I wanna hear how it ends."
