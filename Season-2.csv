2, 14, Announcer, "Futurama is brought to you by ...  ... Glagnar's Human Rinds. It's a buncha muncha cruncha human!"
2, 14, Leela, "Aww! Somebody likes snouts."
2, 14, Fry, "Is it me?"
2, 14, Bender, "Ow, my head! My precious head!   Stupid can opener. You killed my father and now you've come back for me!"
2, 14, Fry, "You alright, Bender?"
2, 14, Bender, "Yeah, I guess so. But I don't see why we keep this ticking time-bomb around just for that dumb animal."
2, 14, Leela, "Don't yell at Nibbler like that.  You hurt his feelings. Come on, pet him and make up."
2, 14, Bender, "No."
2, 14, Leela, "I said pet him."
2, 14, Bender, "I'll pet him. I'll pet him with both hands!  Ow! My ass! Get off!"
2, 14, Leela, "Are you alright?"
2, 14, Bender, "Ah, it's nothing a lawsuit won't cure."
2, 14, Leela, "Not you.  Aww, poor baby chipped a fang."
2, 14, Bender, "Hey, I got a busted ass here, I don't see anyone kissing it."
2, 14, Zoidberg, "Alright, I'm coming."
2, 14, Jeffery, "Remember, Rover gets the pill and Pepper gets the suppository.  Next."
2, 14, Jeffery, "It's just a simple broken fang, nothing serious."
2, 14, Bender, "What's that you say there, doctor? You're gonna have to put him down?"
2, 14, Jeffery, "No-- What? Huh?"
2, 14, Bender, "Terrible shame that. Shall I do the honours?"
2, 14, Leela, "No!"
2, 14, Bender, "You about done?"
2, 14, Leela, "Next time I'm keeping it."
2, 14, Jeffery, "OK, well I believe I have a replacement fang for your pet in the next room.  The jaguar didn't wanna cooperate but luckily he knocked one of my teeth out.  Now then."
2, 14, Fry, "Hey, what are these rings in Nibbler's fang?"
2, 14, Jeffery, "Um, I'm still a little woozy from a gazelle kick this morning but if he's anything like the common tree, the rings might indicate his age."
2, 14, Fry, "Yeah, well, good luck. It'd take some kind of genius to count all those rings."
2, 14, Jeffery, "He's five."
2, 14, Farnsworth, "Happy birthday, young Nibbler."
2, 14, Leela, "Aww, look how cuddly he looks in his new cape!"
2, 14, Bender, "I'd be cuddly too if someone gave me a new cape."
2, 14, Fry, "Who's playing pin the tail on the moon maggot?"
2, 14, Bender, "Ooh, me! Everyone watch how good I am.  And the crowd goes wild! What prize do I get? Cash?"
2, 14, Amy, "Hey, look at Nibbler!"
2, 14, Hermes, "Aww, he's holding a spoon."
2, 14, Zoidberg, "He's so talented!"
2, 14, Bender, "You call that talent? Gather round old Bender and get ready for the show of a lifetime.  Ta-da!"
2, 14, Hermes, "Now he's wearing a hat!"
2, 14, Leela, "Come on, let's all sing Happy Birthday!"
2, 14, All, "What day is today?It's Nibbler's birthday,What a day for a birthday,Let's all have some cake."
2, 14, Fry, "And you smell like one too!"
2, 14, Bender, "Hey, what about this?"
2, 14, Leela, "Bender, I thought you were supposed to be cooking for this party."
2, 14, Bender, "Fine, we'll have rack of Nibbler."
2, 14, Leela, "Just make a simple cake. And this time, if someone's going to jump out of it, make sure you put them in after you cook it."
2, 14, Bender, "So it's a cake you want, is it? I'll make you a cake you'll never forget."
2, 14, Bender, "That'll take care of those annoying rats.  Now, to bake a cake so delicious they'll have no choice but to love and worship me."
2, 14, Bender, "There! This'll teach those filthy bastards who's lovable. Now all I have to do is spell check it and it's ready for my admiring public.  No! Get away from there!  That's it."
2, 14, Bender, "Happy birthday!"
2, 14, Leela, "Bender, what's going--   No!"
2, 14, Bender, "Hey! Can't you see I'm using the toilet?"
2, 14, Amy, "Bender! How could you flush Nibbler down the toilet?"
2, 14, Bender, "Well, step one, I had to lift the seat. That was the first little annoyance. Am I right, men?"
2, 14, Leela, "Aren't you upset at all? How would you feel if I flushed Fry down the toilet?"
2, 14, Bender, "Only one way to find out."
2, 14, Leela, "You have no sympathy for anyone else's feelings."
2, 14, Bender, "Of course I do. Right now I feel sorry for you."
2, 14, Leela, "You do?"
2, 14, Bender, "Yeah. I mean, one cantaloupe-sized bloodshot eye? You ain't winning no beauty pageants, lady."
2, 14, Farnsworth, "And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I too hope one day to go"
2, 14, Leela, "I wouldn't feel so bad if Bender just understood the pain he caused me."
2, 14, Calculon, "Give it to me straight, doctor, don't sugarcoat it."
2, 14, Doctorbot, "Very well. Your entire family died when a plane piloted by your fianc√©e crashed into your uninsured home. And you have inoperable cancer."
2, 14, Bender, "Bet you weren't expecting that one, Calculon!"
2, 14, Amy, "It's like he doesn't understand simple humanoid emotion."
2, 14, Leela, "I wish just once Bender could feel exactly what I feel."
2, 14, Farnsworth, "Actually, through the miracle of science, that can be arranged."
2, 14, Fry, "Uh-oh. Is this gonna be another crazy experiment that crosses a line Man was not meant to cross?"
2, 14, Linda, "The official death toll in that tragic rocket crash has now been raised to 54,000."
2, 14, Bender, "Hey, what the hell are you doing with my head?"
2, 14, Farnsworth, "I need to tinker in it."
2, 14, Bender, "Why don't you just use a potted plant like Fry?"
2, 14, Farnsworth, "Quiet, you. I'm installing an empathy chip."
2, 14, Fry, "And that'll allow Bender to feel other people's emotions?"
2, 14, Farnsworth, "Yes. If by ""allow"" you mean ""force""."
2, 14, Bender, "Ooh! Ow! Son of a-- Careful with that! Ow..."
2, 14, Farnsworth, "Oh, dear. Oh, my. I got it. Once more."
2, 14, Bender, "Ow! Professor!"
2, 14, Farnsworth, "Steady now."
2, 14, Bender, "Ow!"
2, 14, Farnsworth, "There we go.  Now I'll simply tune it to Leela's emotional frequency."
2, 14, Bender, "My God! I'm overcome with ... feelings. I'm experiencing a powerful yearning to ... to cram my gullet full of mackerel heads."
2, 14, Zoidberg, "That's me, baby!"
2, 14, Farnsworth, "Hmm."
2, 14, Bender, "Now I'm worried that I'm not as smart as Leela, but at the same time I feel relieved that I'm cuter than her."
2, 14, Amy, "Uh ... that's me."
2, 14, Fry, "Thanks for covering."
2, 14, Bender, "This time I miss Nibbler and I'm feeling nosy and opinionated."
2, 14, Amy, "Bingo!"
2, 14, Hermes, "That's Leela!"
2, 14, Leela, "Thank you, Professor. I'm happy that Bender can finally feel my pain."
2, 14, Bender, "Happy. I like this feeling. Just don't revert to your usual mopey self."
2, 14, Leela, "I'm not mopey. You shut up!"
2, 14, Bender, "Anger, huh? How dare you make me feel anger, you one-eyed jerk with a dead pet!"
2, 14, Leela, "Thanks for taking me out, Amy. I feel slightly less miserable already."
2, 14, Amy, "Hey, you know what'd cheer you up? You should get a puppy."
2, 14, Leela, "A puppy? Nibbler loved to eat puppies."
2, 14, Fry, "What's your problem?"
2, 14, Bender, "I miss Nibbler."
2, 14, Fry, "You do?"
2, 14, Bender, "Hell, no! It's Leela's stupid feelings.  Why can't she just drink herself happy like a normal person?"
2, 14, Bender, "Uh-oh, jealousy.   You think you're so hot!"
2, 14, Fry, "What?"
2, 14, Bender, "The only reason you get all the guys is because you dress like a tramp!"
2, 14, Fry, "They're just responding to my personality."
2, 14, Amy, "Um, Leela? Armando and I are going to the back seat of his car for coffee. You gonna be alright here by yourself?"
2, 14, Leela, "Sure. I'm having a great time -- really. You two go enjoy yourselves."
2, 14, Bender, "I'm so lonely. I'm gonna go eat a bucket of ice cream.   A bucket of--"
2, 14, Fry, "The spoon's in the foot powder."
2, 14, Bender, "I'm at the end of my rope. I can't live another minute without poor, sweet Nibbler."
2, 14, Fry, "Too bad he wasn't an alligator. Y'know, when you flush those things, they stay alive in the sewers."
2, 14, Bender, "Really?"
2, 14, Fry, "Yep. My friend's cousin's caseworker saw one once. It's a widely-believed fact."
2, 14, Bender, "Hmm, sewers.  Thinking, thinking, thinking."
2, 14, Bender, "Hang on, Nibbler. Uncle Bender's coming to save you.  Damn, it's too small.  What did those human design this for anyway?  Aha! Bender, one; toilet, zero!  See you on the other side!"
2, 14, Fry, "Bender? Bender?"
2, 14, Fry, "Have you seen my sombrero?"
2, 14, Leela, "Now he's flushed himself down the toilet? Who's he gonna flush next?"
2, 14, Fry, "Hey, it's your fault. He only flushed himself because your emotions made him feel bad."
2, 14, Leela, "You're right. I feel terrible."
2, 14, Fry, "Oh, great, now you're making him feel worse!"
2, 14, Leela, "I guess we'd better go down into the sewers and look for him."
2, 14, Amy, "Are you crazy? There's mutants down there! They'll eat you alive."
2, 14, Zoidberg, "They're hideous!"
2, 14, Leela, "There's no such thing as mutants. That's a ridiculous urban myth."
2, 14, Farnsworth, "Oh, don't be so sure. Many scientists believe humans really could mutate down there. Uh, due to exposure to toxic waste and radioactive run-off and good old American faeces!"
2, 14, Fry, "God bless America."
2, 14, Fry, "Phew! Uh, ladies first."
2, 14, Fry, "Oh, and the aftertaste!"
2, 14, Leela, "What is it?"
2, 14, Fry, "I burned my finger."
2, 14, Leela, "OK, check the guidebook."
2, 14, Fry, "Looks like we're under Park Avenue. Ooh, ritzy! Just think"
2, 14, Leela, "Wait, what's that?"
2, 14, Bender, "I never should have thrown out the manual."
2, 14, Leela, "Bender, you didn't have to come down here."
2, 14, Bender, "I know. But I just missed Nibbler so much."
2, 14, Leela, "He was so cute."
2, 14, Bender, "He was so sweet."
2, 14, Fry, "Eck! This emotional display is making me nauseous.  Or maybe it's whatever that is."
2, 14, Leela, "Nibbler?"
2, 14, Bender, "Nibbler?"
2, 14, Leela, "It's no use. We'd better turn back. Which way, Fry?"
2, 14, Fry, "Hmm. According to this map, the only way out is through ... that pipe.  Don't worry. It gets wider after about a mile."
2, 14, Leela, "Idiot."
2, 14, Bender, "Idiot."
2, 14, Fry, "OK, OK, never mind. I'll just ask those people for directions."
2, 14, Leela, "Mutants!"
2, 14, Leela, "Mutants! They're real!"
2, 14, Fry, "I'll take care of this!  Back! Back!"
2, 14, Vyolet, "Thanks, handsome."
2, 14, Dwayne, "Please, do not be frightened, we're harmless."
2, 14, Raoul, "I have three arms."
2, 14, Dwayne, "I said ""harmless"" not ""armless""."
2, 14, Vyolet, "Lay off him. You know he's only got one ear."
2, 14, Fry, "Hey, aren't you supposed to be eating our brains? You're mutants."
2, 14, Dwayne, "Mutants? Perhaps it is you who are the mutants."
2, 14, Vyolet, "Please, Dwayne, have you looked in a mirror lately?"
2, 14, Raoul, "Welcome to our village. It may not be Paris but it has a certain quaint charm that I, for one, wouldn't trade for the world."
2, 14, Bender, "You guys realise you live in a sewer, right?"
2, 14, Dwayne, "Perhaps. But perhaps your civilisation is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you."
2, 14, Leela, "No, we're on the top."
2, 14, Fry, "Daylight and everything."
2, 14, Vyolet, "It must be wonderful."
2, 14, Bender, "Eh."
2, 14, Leela, "Listen. We actually came down here to find our pet, Nibbler. He got flushed down the toilet."
2, 14, Raoul, "Well if he got flushed down the toilet he probably came through here. Everything always does. Follow me.  All that is ours was once flushed down your toilets. Over there is our aquarium.  This is our library."
2, 14, Bender, "Nothing but crumpled porno and Ayn Rand."
2, 14, Raoul, "And over here is our church."
2, 14, Fry, "Wow. You guys worship an unexploded nuclear bomb?"
2, 14, Vyolet, "Yeah, but nobody's that observant. It's mainly a Christmas and Easter thing."
2, 14, Leela, "Nibbler?"
2, 14, Bender, "Come to Daddy, sweetie-ookums."
2, 14, Fry, "So, is it true that alligators flushed down the toilet survive down here?"
2, 14, Vyolet, "No. That's just an urban legend."
2, 14, Bender, "Then what are those?"
2, 14, Vyolet, "Crocodiles."
2, 14, Raoul, "We keep them as pets. Then, when they grow too large, we flush them down into the sub-sewer."
2, 14, Dwayne, "Some say there's a freakish race of sub-mutants down there."
2, 14, Vyolet, "Please, that's just a sub-urban legend."
2, 14, Dwayne, "Oh? Then I suppose you also don't believe in ...  ... El Chupanibre."
2, 14, Leela, "El Chupanibre? What's that?"
2, 14, Dwayne, "Gather round, children, for the legend of El Chupanibre.(singing) He creeps and crawls in the midnight hush,Silent as a low-flow toilet flush,Watch your step,'Cause sooner or later,He'll eat you whole,And half your alligator."
2, 14, Vyolet, "Crocodile."
2, 14, Dwayne, "Whatever."
2, 14, Leela, "Wait. Our pet Nibbler loves fresh crocodile. It's his favourite treat. He must be El Chupanibre."
2, 14, Bender, "Hey, yeah!"
2, 14, Raoul, "You unleashed the dreaded El Chupanibre upon us? Then you are our sworn enemies."
2, 14, Leela, "You don't understand. He would never hurt people. Let us help you capture him."
2, 14, Dwayne, "Impossible. If the legend is true, our only hope is to offer him a snack-rifice."
2, 14, Raoul, "Yes. An unspoiled virgin."
2, 14, Leela, "I volunteer."
2, 14, Vyolet, "Nice try, Leela, but we've all seen Zapp Brannigan's webpage."
2, 14, Bender, "Oh, I made myself feel bad."
2, 14, Raoul, "She'll have to do. Chain her to the post!  And rip her shirt a little.  Behold. When El Chupanibre comes for the, uh, ""virgin"", he will be snared by this rope trap."
2, 14, Dwayne, "Shh. El Chupanibre comes soon. It is nightfall."
2, 14, Leela, "Nightfall? How can you tell down here?"
2, 14, Dwayne, "The tide is coming in."
2, 14, Vyolet, "Quiet! The beast approaches."
2, 14, Bender, "Nibbler! Aw, come here, precious!  Look, everyone, it's El Chupanibre."
2, 14, Dwayne, "That's not El Chupanibre."
2, 14, Bender, "Say what?"
2, 14, Dwayne, "That's El Chupanibre."
2, 14, Fry, "I'll take care of this."
2, 14, Leela, "Bender, do something."
2, 14, Bender, "I'm too scared."
2, 14, Fry, "Leela, your scaredness is being transmitted straight to Bender. If you care about Nibbler, stop caring about him!"
2, 14, Leela, "I can't. I love every living creature."
2, 14, Fry, "Even me?"
2, 14, Leela, "As a friend."
2, 14, Fry, "Damn."
2, 14, Bender, "Listen to me, Leela"
2, 14, Leela, "Well, I could use a new tank top."
2, 14, Bender, "Bigger! Bigger!"
2, 14, Leela, "A fashionable tank top. And designer boots ... encrusted with jewels."
2, 14, Bender, "Don't stop now, you'll need some pants to go with that outfit."
2, 14, Leela, "Yeah. And I could afford it all if I didn't have to feed that stupid Nibbler."
2, 14, Bender, "Bender is back. I'll save you, Nibbler."
2, 14, Fry, "Bender's gonna be killed!"
2, 14, Leela, "You know what else I could use? A weekend at one of those fancy spas. And a Toblerone."
2, 14, Fry, "Yeah!"
2, 14, Leela, "You did it!"
2, 14, Raoul, "Let's have a tissue-tape parade!"
2, 14, Bender, "No, thanks!"
2, 14, Dwayne, "Gather round, children, to hear the legend of Bender.(singing) He came from above with a--(talking) It's gonna be many a year before someone flushes another guitar string."
2, 14, Farnsworth, "That was a disgusting story."
2, 14, Leela, "And it's all thanks to Bender. I love you, Bender."
2, 14, Bender, "I love you too.  Get that stupid chip out of me before I kill myself!"
2, 14, Farnsworth, "Bender, you won't believe this, but the empathy chip burned out. The emotion you felt for Nibbler was actually your own."
2, 14, Fry, "Looks like Bender learned an important lesson about respecting other people's feelings afterall."
2, 14, Farnsworth, "No, I'm wrong. The empathy chip was running at triple capacity."
2, 14, Bender, "And I still barely felt anything. Goodnight, losers!"
2, 14, Leela, "You know, Bender may not have learned anything from me, but I think I actually learned something from him.   So long, jerkwads!"
2, 14, Farnsworth, "So long!"
2, 15, Fry, "Hmm. Horsey to pointy guy six.  Check."
2, 15, Bender, "Hmm. Get him, boys!"
2, 15, Fry, "Good move."
2, 15, Farnsworth, "Good news, everyone.  We have a mission to further the noble cause of intergalactic peace."
2, 15, Bender, "Nope. Watching cartoons."
2, 15, Fry, "Sorry."
2, 15, Leela, "What's the mission?"
2, 15, Farnsworth, "It's a delivery for the Democratic Order Of Planets."
2, 15, Fry, "DOOP? What's that?"
2, 15, Farnsworth, "It's similar to the United Nations from your time, Fry."
2, 15, Fry, "Uh..."
2, 15, Hermes, "Or like the Federation from your Star Trek programme."
2, 15, Fry, "Oh!"
2, 15, Farnsworth, "Tonight is the ribbon-cutting for the DOOP's new headquarters."
2, 15, Leela, "What are we delivering?"
2, 15, Farnsworth, "Something without which no ribbon-cutting ceremony could proceed. The ceremonial oversized scissors."
2, 15, Leela, "We'll get them there as quickly as we can."
2, 15, Farnsworth, "Alright, but don't run with them."
2, 15, Fry, "Wow! There's a million aliens. I've never seen anything so mind-blowing. Ooh, a reception table with muffins!"
2, 15, Glab, "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the DOOP's magnificent new headquarters. A fitting home for an organisation that has fostered peace throughout the universe. Even between the Insectoids and the Space Lizards."
2, 15, Fry, "So, what's it like on planet Amazonia?"
2, 15, Amazonian, "Big rats there. Me crush with club."
2, 15, Fry, "That's so interesting. Maybe we could get to know each other over a coffee."
2, 15, Glab, "I can think of no better place for this centre of diplomacy than here in orbit around the Neutral Planet.  What are your thoughts on this momentous occasion, Your Neutralness?"
2, 15, Neutral President, "I have no strong feelings one way or the other."
2, 15, Zapp, "I hate these filthy Neutrals, Kif. With enemies you know where they stand but with Neutrals, who knows? It sickens me.  Halt.  Why, Leela, I do believe we've met."
2, 15, Bender, "He means you guys did it."
2, 15, Leela, "If you don't mind, we're here to deliver the scissors for the ribbon-cutting."
2, 15, Zapp, "Then you're under arrest."
2, 15, Leela, "What for?"
2, 15, Zapp, "How do I know these scissors aren't part of some Neutral plot?"
2, 15, Leela, "But they're not even sharp. Who could I possibly hurt with them?"
2, 15, Zapp, "The Yarn People of Nylar 4?  So, a plan to assassinate a weird-looking alien with scissors. How very Neutral of you."
2, 15, Leela, "What?"
2, 15, Zapp, "It was almost the perfect crime, but you forgot one thing"
2, 15, Kif, "Why?"
2, 15, Zapp, "So beautiful, yet so neutral.  Drag them to the ship."
2, 15, Glab, "And now, to cut the ribbon, the legendary DOOP captain who just returned from a triumphant carpet-bombing of Eden 7, Zapp Brannigan."
2, 15, Zapp, "What makes a man turn neutral? Lust for gold? Power? Or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality?"
2, 15, Kif, "Um, sir, you're supposed to be cutting the ribbon right now."
2, 15, Zapp, "No matter. I'll simply cut it from here with the ship's laser."
2, 15, Kif, "Sir, I don't think that's wise."
2, 15, Zapp, "Kif, if there's one thing I don't need it's your I-don't-think-that's-wise attitude."
2, 15, Zapp, "Whoopsie-daisy!"
2, 15, Glab, "Zapp Brannigan, you stand accused of blowing up DOOP headquarters. How do you plead?"
2, 15, Zapp, "Absolutely 99% not guilty."
2, 15, Glab, "Then the prosecutor will call his first witness."
2, 15, Hyper-Chicken, "Your Honour, I'm just a simple Hyper-Chicken from a backwoods asteroid but if it please the court I reckon I'll call the entire jury."
2, 15, Glab, "I'm going to allow this."
2, 15, Hyper-Chicken, "Members of the jury ...  ... did y'all happen to catch a gander at who blew up that there DOOP headquarters?"
2, 15, Juror #1, "That's the guy, right there."
2, 15, Juror #2, "Oh, yeah, right there."
2, 15, Small Glurmo #1, "That one."
2, 15, Hyper-Chicken, "And are y'all gonna vote to convict him?"
2, 15, Neptunian, "You'd better believe it."
2, 15, Juror #1, "You bet."
2, 15, Glab, "The jury is instructed to disregard its own testimony."
2, 15, Hyper-Chicken, "Your Honour, the prosecution rests."
2, 15, Glab, "The evidence against Zapp Brannigan is strong. However, in light of his years of service, and the incompetence of this hillbilly prosecutor, I'm afraid I must dismiss all charges."
2, 15, Leela, "Dismiss all charges? Your Honour, I know the case is closed and you've rendered your verdict, but I wanna testify."
2, 15, Glab, "I'm going to allow this."
2, 15, Hyper-Chicken, "Now, Miss Leela, on the date in question, were you or were you not wearing a hoop skirt?"
2, 15, Leela, "That's a stupid question. What matters is Zapp Brannigan is the sorriest captain I've ever seen, and I saw the idiot blow up DOOP headquarters with my own eye."
2, 15, Zapp, "I'd like to cross-examine the witness."
2, 15, Glab, "I'm going to allow this."
2, 15, Zapp, "We've met before have we not?"
2, 15, Leela, "Yes."
2, 15, Zapp, "And on that occasion, did you have sex with someone? May I remind you you are still under oath."
2, 15, Leela, "Yes."
2, 15, Zapp, "Please point out the person in this courtroom you had sex with.  And his name is?"
2, 15, Leela, "Zapp Brannigan."
2, 15, Zapp, "The very same Zapp Brannigan who did not blow up DOOP headquarters. I rest my case."
2, 15, Glab, "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you may begin your deliberations."
2, 15, Small Glurmo #1, "Your Honour, we have reached a verdict. We find the defendant ... guilty."
2, 15, Glab, "Zapp Brannigan, you are hereby stripped of your rank as captain and dismissed from the DOOP."
2, 15, Zapp, "I'd like to make one final statement. Kif, c'mere and hold up the flag.  And wave it a little, for God's sakes. My friends, you can take away a man's title and his uniform but you can never take away his integrity or his honour. Plus it was mostly Kif's fault."
2, 15, Kif, "What?"
2, 15, Glab, "Kif Kroker, you are also stripped of your rank and dishonourably discharged."
2, 15, Zapp, "One day a man has everything, the next day he blows up a $400 billion space station and the next day he has nothing. It makes you think."
2, 15, Kif, "No, it doesn't."
2, 15, Zapp, "Come, Kif, it's time to begin our life as civilians.  That's an order, soldier."
2, 15, Fry, "Hey, Bender?"
2, 15, Bender, "Yeah?"
2, 15, Leela, "Alright, this is the third hose fight I've broken up today and the second one using actual hoses. Now move your lazy asses and start scrubbing the ship like I ordered you to."
2, 15, Fry, "You don't have to get so mad, Leela."
2, 15, Bender, "Yeah, Fry already wiped off some of the dirt with his finger."
2, 15, Leela, "Zapp?"
2, 15, Zapp, "Leela, I didn't know where else to turn. You're the only woman who ever loved me."
2, 15, Leela, "I never loved you."
2, 15, Zapp, "I mean physically."
2, 15, Leela, "What do you want?"
2, 15, Zapp, "Just let me work for a little food. Perhaps I could paint a fence, or service you sexually, or mop the floors."
2, 15, Leela, "You don't know how to do any of those things."
2, 15, Zapp, "Kif might."
2, 15, Farnsworth, "Leela, who are you talking to?"
2, 15, Zapp, "Just a broken-down hobo who's hit rock-bottom. And his commanding officer."
2, 15, Farnsworth, "Why, you're that disgraced starship captain.  Having him on staff will distract people from our horrendous safety record.  Come in."
2, 15, Farnsworth, "I'd like everyone to meet our new employees.   Which ones are new?"
2, 15, Hermes, "The green dude and the fat man."
2, 15, Farnsworth, "Hmm, I could swear I've never seen that robot before either."
2, 15, Bender, "I'm Bender. You know? The lovable rascal."
2, 15, Farnsworth, "Oh, yes, yes. My good friend, of course.  Anyway, whoever you all are, I have good news. You'll be making a delivery to Stumbos 4, a planet with such high gravity you'll most likely be crushed under the weight of your own hair. Enjoy!"
2, 15, Zapp, "So, this Leela. I know she's a very sensuous woman but what manner of captain is she?"
2, 15, Fry, "She's really strict."
2, 15, Bender, "And mean."
2, 15, Zapp, "I see. Does she by any chance give the crewmembers spankings?"
2, 15, Fry, "No, she just makes us do work and stuff."
2, 15, Zapp, "Good, good. But should she ever institute some sort of bare-bottom spanking policy, let me go in your place. I won't have my comrades harmed."
2, 15, Bender, "Hey, this guy's alright!"
2, 15, Zapp, "Here's to us poor schmoes working for the man. Even if he is a hot, sexy, female man."
2, 15, Kif, "I've computed out landing co-ordinates, Captain."
2, 15, Leela, "Thanks, Kif. Very nice work."
2, 15, Kif, "Wait, what?"
2, 15, Leela, "I said ""very nice work""."
2, 15, Kif, "This is the happiest day of my life."
2, 15, Leela, "OK, crew, listen up. Your job is to delivery these 40 pillows to that hotel."
2, 15, Bender, "They're not very heavy but you don't hear me not complaining."
2, 15, Leela, "They're not heavy in here because we have an anti-grav pump. But once you get out on the surface the gravity will be very intense."
2, 15, Fry, "Hey, no prob', this lead apron'll protect me."
2, 15, Leela, "I don't want any screw-ups. Use the hover-dolly and just deliver one pillow at a time."
2, 15, Bender, "Hey, here's an idea, let's deliver all the pillows at once."
2, 15, Fry, "Yeah!"
2, 15, Zapp, "That's using the old noodle!"
2, 15, Zapp, "Come on, girdle. Hold!"
2, 15, Bender, "Uh-oh."
2, 15, Leela, "What the hell happened?"
2, 15, Bender, "Some breaking occurred, the dolly was involved, that's about all we know."
2, 15, Leela, "I told you dumb apes not to overload it. Each of those pillows weighs 150lbs here."
2, 15, Fry, "Alright, don't get your panties in a knot. We'll just use the back-up dolly."
2, 15, Bender, "I'll start loading up the pillows."
2, 15, Leela, "No way, Jack. You disobeyed an order, so now you have to deliver all 40 pillows by hand."
2, 15, Zapp, "Let me ask you a serious question, Leela"
2, 15, Leela, "Just get to work."
2, 15, Bender, "I'm Leela, get to work, neh, neh, neh."
2, 15, Fry, "I agree."
2, 15, Kif, "The point is, it's just so humiliating working for that man. Once, he actually ordered me to ... shave his armpits while he was in the bathtub. So, I said--"
2, 15, Leela, "Y'know, why don't we talk about something besides Zapp for a while?"
2, 15, Kif, "Oh, alright. Um ... well ... how 'bout then, um... OK, well, there he was in the tub, alright?"
2, 15, Fry, "Ah, some good old high-gravity rain. That'll cool us off."
2, 15, Bender, "This is all Leela's fault."
2, 15, Fry, "Yeah. If she had let us use the back-up dolly, we could have broken it, given up and gone home by now."
2, 15, Zapp, "Y'know, boys, a good captain needs many skills, such as boldness, daring and a velour uniform. And I'm not convinced Leela has any of those things."
2, 15, Fry, "Ah, Leela's not that bad. I just wish she didn't make us work so much."
2, 15, Zapp, "Back when I was captain all I asked from my men was their complete loyalty. If I had that, then for all I cared they could sit around the whole day drinking beer in their underpants."
2, 15, Bender, "Beer?"
2, 15, Fry, "Underpants?"
2, 15, Kif, "But now, Zapp's not captain anymore. I'm free!  Oh, you hear that? I'm actually laughing!"
2, 15, Fry, "This is a mutiny."
2, 15, Bender, "You're outta here, lady. Zapp's the new captain."
2, 15, Fry, "All hail the new captain."
2, 15, Zapp, "Leela, you might be a formidable do-er of the nasty but I am forced to relieve you of your post."
2, 15, Leela, "On what grounds, you slobbering oaf?"
2, 15, Zapp, "Failure to prevent a mutiny. Throw her in the brig."
2, 15, Fry, "We don't have a brig."
2, 15, Zapp, "Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as ""the brig""."
2, 15, Leela, "You really don't want me to be captain anymore?"
2, 15, Bender, "You got it, genius."
2, 15, Leela, "But, didn't I do a good job?"
2, 15, Fry, "You were mean and you yelled and you made us do all that work."
2, 15, Leela, "Sometimes a captain needs to do those things. Besides I, I thought we were friends."
2, 15, Fry, "Yeah, well, you shouldn't have been such a mean captain then."
2, 15, Bender, "Don't worry, Leela. Soon we'll be able to look back on this and laugh."
2, 15, Zapp, "Back in my old uniform, and it nearly still fits. Even after all that fattening hobo cuisine."
2, 15, Kif, "What shall I do with your civilian clothes, sir?"
2, 15, Zapp, "Take them to the laundry-brig.  So, do I have your loyalty, men?"
2, 15, Bender, "To the ends of the universe."
2, 15, Fry, "Ten hundred percent!"
2, 15, Zapp, "That's not nearly loyal enough. I order you to sit around and drink beer until you're as loyal as Kif here."
2, 15, Bender, "Yes, sir, sir!"
2, 15, Kif, "Um, may I have a beer, sir?"
2, 15, Zapp, "No. You're loyal enough already. Meanwhile, I have a plan. We will single-handedly attack our archenemy the Neutral Planet."
2, 15, Kif, "Oh, jeez."
2, 15, Zapp, "Once the neutral war machine lies in ruins, I'll be a hero again and the DOOP will reinstate me as captain."
2, 15, Kif, "But, sir, that plan makes no sense."
2, 15, Zapp, "Maybe not to you, Kif, but if I recall correctly, you were court-martialled in disgrace."
2, 15, Fry, "Ooh, burn!"
2, 15, Bender, "Nailed you, buddy!"
2, 15, Zapp, "Prepare to continue the epic struggle between good and neutral."
2, 15, Fry, "This is awesome! We're gonna be like pow-pow-pow, and they're gonna be like ...  ... and then we'll have pancakes to celebrate and I'll be like..."
2, 15, Zapp, "Precisely. Now, in the name of all that is good and honourable, we'll call the Neutral President with a message of peace, then blast him."
2, 15, Bender, "Yes, sir, sirdy-sir-sir-sir!"
2, 15, Zapp, "Fly the white flag of war."
2, 15, Zapp, "This is Zapp Brannigan of the good ship ... Planet Express Ship. I come swinging the olive branch of peace."
2, 15, Neutral President's Aide, "Should we trust him, Your Neutralness?"
2, 15, Neutral President, "All I know is my gut says maybe."
2, 15, Bender, "What now, chief?"
2, 15, Zapp, "Now we crash the ship into their headquarters, killing them in a hellish firestorm from which no living thing can escape."
2, 15, Fry, "Good, good, then what?"
2, 15, Zapp, "Then your mission is complete. I, meanwhile, will have ejected to safety, wearing the only spacesuit on board."
2, 15, Fry, "Wait a second. Is this plan gonna kill us?"
2, 15, Zapp, "Of course. What do you think I meant by ""loyalty""? Now help me into the only spacesuit. It looks a bit sweaty in there so you may need to apply baby powder."
2, 15, Fry, "Leela, we want you to be captain again."
2, 15, Leela, "Let me guess. He cancelled naptime?  He ran out of beer?  So he's about to kill us?"
2, 15, Fry, "We want Leela to be captain again."
2, 15, Zapp, "So it's mutiny, is it? I never thought I'd see the day. Come, Kif, let's eject. I found a children's spacesuit you can wear."
2, 15, Kif, "To be honest, sir, I'd rather stay here with Captain Leela. She actually listens to what I have to--"
2, 15, Leela, "Oh, no! He's disabled the steering.  We're gonna crash!"
2, 15, Bender, "Leela save me ... and yourself, I guess ... and my banjo.  And Fry."
2, 15, Leela, "OK, OK. We have one chance. Are you willing to do what I say as captain?"
2, 15, Fry, "Absolutely."
2, 15, Leela, "Even if I make you work hard?"
2, 15, Bender, "As your God is my witness."
2, 15, Leela, "Then go get the hover-dolly you didn't break and load all the dark matter into the left engine."
2, 15, Bender, "Oh, man, that crap's heavy."
2, 15, Fry, "And warm."
2, 15, Leela, "Just do it."
2, 15, Neutral President's Aide, "Your Neutralness, it's a beige alert."
2, 15, Neutral President, "If I don't survive, tell my wife, ""Hello""."
2, 15, Leela, "Hurry! I don't wanna die at the age of 25."
2, 15, Bender, "Honey, unless we hit a time warp, I wouldn't worry about it."
2, 15, Fry, "It's too low."
2, 15, Bender, "Quick."
2, 15, Leela, "You did it! You actually did it!"
2, 15, Fry, "And no one will have to punish anyone for the mutiny."
2, 15, Zapp, "And so, when Captain Leela panicked, perhaps distracted by female troubles, my quick thinking allowed me to do whatever I did to save the day."
2, 15, Glab, "Captain Leela, is this rambling story of magic and heroism true?"
2, 15, Leela, "Well, actually--"
2, 15, Farnsworth, "That a girl! If they don't take him back we can keep him as captain."
2, 15, Leela, "Your Honour, it's all true"
2, 15, Glab, "In that case, Zapp Brannigan, I hereby restore your rank and parking privileges."
2, 15, Farnsworth, "Oh, foo!"
2, 15, Zapp, "Come, Kif, we've got work to do."
2, 15, Kif, "I-I'll call and tell you about it."
2, 15, Fry, "Leela, I just want you to know that even though you're mean, you're the best captain ever."
2, 15, Bender, "Yeah, you're one dynamite lady. Can we have a week off?"
2, 15, Leela, "No."
2, 15, Fry, "Please?"
2, 15, Bender, "Come on, Captain."
2, 15, Leela, "Oh, alright."
2, 15, Farnsworth, "No time off."
2, 15, Fry, "Aw, man."
2, 15, Leela, "Let's mutiny!"
2, 16, Narrator, "You're entering the vicinity of an area adjacent to a location.  The kind of place where there might be a monster or some kind of weird mirror.  These are just examples. It could also be something much better.  Prepare to enter The Scary Door.  As per your request, please find enclosed the last man on earth."
2, 16, Man, "Finally, solitude. I can read books for all eternity.  It's not fair! It's not fair! Wait, my eyes aren't that bad. I can still read the large print books.  It's not f-- Well, lucky I know how to read Braille!  Hey, look at that weird mirror!"
2, 16, Bender, "Cursed by his own hubris!"
2, 16, Leela, "There's a political debate on! Quick, change the channel!"
2, 16, Bender, "Hey, that's what Fry said when we turned on the debate!"
2, 16, Announcer, "C-SPAN9 presents"
2, 16, Leela, "Look, I know there are no car chases but this is important. One of these two men will become president of the world."
2, 16, Fry, "What do we care? We live in the United States."
2, 16, Leela, "The United States is part of the world."
2, 16, Fry, "Wow! I have been gone a long time."
2, 16, Johnson, "It's time someone had the courage to stand up and say"
2, 16, Jackson, "Now I respect my opponent. I think he's a good man but, quite frankly, I agree with everything he just said!"
2, 16, Fry, "These are the candidates? They sound like clones.  Wait a minute. They are clones!"
2, 16, Leela, "Don't let their identical DNA fool you. They differ on some key issues."
2, 16, Johnson, "I say your three cent titanium tax goes too far."
2, 16, Jackson, "And I say your three cent titanium tax doesn't go too far enough!"
2, 16, Fry, "If I were registered to vote, I'd send these clowns a message by staying home on election day and dressing up like a clown."
2, 16, Leela, "You're not registered?"
2, 16, Fry, "Nope. Not vaccinated either! Besides, it's not like one vote ever made a difference."
2, 16, Leela, "That's not true; the first robot president won by exactly one vote."
2, 16, Bender, "Ah, yes, John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a cord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree."
2, 16, Farnsworth, "But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver."
2, 16, Leela, "The point is, one vote can make a difference and even though it won't, I'm still taking you to get registered."
2, 16, Farnsworth, "Yes, that's a capital idea. Let's all go register!"
2, 16, Fry, "Professor, when did you become so obsessed with voting?"
2, 16, Farnsworth, "The very instant I became old."
2, 16, Farnsworth, "The problem with both parties is that they always want to give your tax dollars to the less fortunate."
2, 16, Fry, "The less fortunate get all the breaks!"
2, 16, Zoidberg, "You know, Fry, you could join a third party, maybe."
2, 16, Amy, "Only weirdos and mutants join third parties."
2, 16, Zoidberg, "Really? I'd better keep an eye out at the next meeting."
2, 16, Fry, "What party do you belong to, Bender?"
2, 16, Bender, "I'm not allowed to vote."
2, 16, Fry, "'Cause you're a robot?"
2, 16, Bender, "No, convicted felon."
2, 16, Woman, "We favour unreasonably huge subsidies to the Brain Slug Planet."
2, 16, Fry, "OK, but what are the Brain Slugs who control you gonna do for the working man?"
2, 16, Woman, "Attach Brain Slugs to them."
2, 16, Fry, "Sure, you say that now!"
2, 16, Amy, "So, is it true you can make all kinds of shirts and ropes out of hemp?"
2, 16, Stoned Guy, "Dave's not here, man."
2, 16, Amy, "I also heard hemp makes great shampoo."
2, 16, Stoned Guy, "It does? No way! I gotta check out this brochure!"
2, 16, Farnsworth, "So what are you doing to protect my constitutional right to bear doomsday devices?"
2, 16, N.R.A. Man, "Well, first off, we're gonna get rid of that three-day waiting period for mad scientists."
2, 16, Farnsworth, "Damn straight! Today, the mad scientist can't get a doomsday device, tomorrow it's the mad grad student. Where will it end?"
2, 16, N.R.A. Man, "Amen, brother. I don't go anywhere without my mutated anthrax ...  ... for duck hunting."
2, 16, Zoidberg, "Sure, humans are cute, but how else are we supposed to test cosmetics?"
2, 16, Hermes, "I concur."
2, 16, Fry, "Now here's a party I can get excited about. Sign me up!"
2, 16, V.A.P. Man, "Sorry, not with that attitude."
2, 16, Fry, "OK then, screw it."
2, 16, V.A.P. Man, "Welcome aboard, brother!"
2, 16, Fry, "Alright!"
2, 16, V.A.P. Man, "You're out."
2, 16, Fry, "That was pretty cool. I think I'm actually starting to get interested in politics."
2, 16, Linda, "And so, with two weeks left in the campaign, the question on everyone's mind is who will be the next President of Earth? Jack Johnson or bitter rival John Jackson? Two terrific candidates, huh, Morbo?"
2, 16, Morbo, "All humans are vermin in the eyes of Morbo."
2, 16, Linda, "In other local news, disaster struck on Saturn's moon of Titan today, when a titanium mine collapsed, trapping 1,000 robot workers."
2, 16, Bender, "What? Lord have mercy!"
2, 16, Linda, "Unless something is done quickly, the trapped robots will be dead within 300 years.  Sir, what rescue operations are planned?"
2, 16, Mine Spokesman, "The plan is basically to pave over the area and get on with our lives."
2, 16, Morbo, "News of the mines closing sent titanium prices skyrocketing."
2, 16, Bender, "Alright! I'm rich!"
2, 16, Leela, "What are you talking about?"
2, 16, Bender, "My body's 40% titanium!  I'm finally richer than those snooty ATM machines."
2, 16, Fry, "Too bad you can't spend it."
2, 16, Bender, "Oh, can't I?"
2, 16, Fry, "No."
2, 16, Bender, "Watch me, poor man."
2, 16, Pawnbroker, "Pleasure doing business with you."
2, 16, Bender, "Game's over, losers. I have all the money! Compare your lives to mine and then kill yourselves!  Hey, get away. Shoo! I'll give you five dollars to not do what you're thinking about doing.  You just lost five dollars!"
2, 16, Bender, "Hey, buddy. Little help?   Thank you!"
2, 16, Bender, "Hello, peasants."
2, 16, Leela, "Bender? What happened to you?"
2, 16, Fry, "Yeah, you look different. Did you get a haircut?"
2, 16, Bender, "No, I sold my body."
2, 16, Farnsworth, "Sold your body? Oh, Bender, I've been down that road. I know it's glamorous and the parties are great but you'll end up spending every dollar you make on jewellery and skintight pants."
2, 16, Fry, "This is crazy, Bender. How are you gonna live without a body?"
2, 16, Bender, "Pft! Bodies are for hookers and fat people! All I need is a wad of cash with a head wrapped around it."
2, 16, Fry, "Well, at least now you can pay off your loan shark."
2, 16, Bender, "Yeah, right. What's he gonna do, break my legs?"
2, 16, Bender, "Ah, this is the life. Another martini, please."
2, 16, Bender, "Shaken, not stirred.  Aw, yeah!"
2, 16, Bender, "Put it all on black."
2, 16, Croupier, "21 red.  I beg your pardon. 33 black."
2, 16, Bender, "Yes! The rich get richer!"
2, 16, Bender, "Strike! In your face, Leela!  Ow!"
2, 16, Bender, "Timber!"
2, 16, Fry, "Hey, Bender, can I take a ride in your car?"
2, 16, Bender, "Maybe if you clean up first. It looks like your neck stepped in something. Oh, I'm sorry, that's just your body!"
2, 16, Fry, "Hey! You look me in the shins and say that."
2, 16, Bender, "I've had it up to here with this place. I'm off to the Head Museum to hang out with classy heads like me who appreciate the finer things"
2, 16, Bender, "Now, which group of heads is good enough for me to hang out with? What do you think, Fry? Fry?"
2, 16, Schiffer, "Hi, I'm Claudia Schiffer's head."
2, 16, Fry, "I recognise you. Didn't you use to have a body of some sort?"
2, 16, Schiffer, "Yeah, but it was holding me back. You know, I just did the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimcap Issue."
2, 16, Fry, "Well, you're looking great."
2, 16, Schiffer, "Thanks. I wouldn't mind losing a few pounds though."
2, 16, Fry, "Couldn't hurt."
2, 16, Bender, "Ah, US presidents.  Sturdy shelves, good security.  This place has class."
2, 16, Clinton, "Hey, sugar cookie. You know, legally, nothing I can do counts as sex anymore."
2, 16, Ford, "I apologise for his rudeness, ma'am. He gets this way around meaty-looking women."
2, 16, Fry, "Hey, I remember you. I was gonna vote for you one time. But voting isn't cool so I stayed home alone and got trashed on Listerine."
2, 16, Ford, "Frankly, I've never felt voting to be all that essential to the process."
2, 16, Nixon, "No kidding, Ford."
2, 16, Bender, "So then the hookerbot says, ""That's not my expansion slot"" and my friend says, ""That's not my gold-plated 25-pin connector!"""
2, 16, Washington, "Oh, Bender. Thou robots really cracketh me up."
2, 16, Bender, "You know, I like it here. What's the rent on one of these jars?"
2, 16, George H.W. Bush, "Sorry, Bender, but we just can't allow every Tom, Dick, and Harry to move in. No offence, Jefferson, Nixon and Truman."
2, 16, Carter, "Maybe Mr. Bender can get a spot in the closet of presidential losers."
2, 16, Dole, "Bob Dole needs company. LaRouche won't stop with the ""knock knock"" jokes."
2, 16, Bender, "Pass."
2, 16, Washington, "So, telleth, Bender. What hath happened to your body?"
2, 16, Bender, "I hocked it."
2, 16, Washington, "Hocked it? Why wouldst thou do that?"
2, 16, Bender, "Same reason you hocked your teeth."
2, 16, Washington, "Ah. Booze money."
2, 16, Nixon, "I remember my body; flabby, pastey-skinned, riddled with phlebitis. A good Republican body! God, I loved it."
2, 16, Fry, "I hear that. I spent most of my teen years loving my body. Course, it was tough love but-- Ooh!"
2, 16, Leela, "Fry, he opened up relations with China. He doesn't want to hear about your ding-dong."
2, 16, Bender, "So, Nixon. Even if you miss your body, being a head's great too, right?"
2, 16, Nixon, "No, son. It's a sad and lonely life."
2, 16, Bender, "Oh, great. Now you tell me!"
2, 16, Nixon, "That's my style. I like to kick 'em when they're down!"
2, 16, Bender, "Ones ... zeros ... one, one, zero, zero, one--"
2, 16, Fry, "Bender, what is it?"
2, 16, Bender, "Whoa, what an awful dream. Ones and zeros everywhere. And I thought I saw a two."
2, 16, Fry, "It was just a dream, Bender. There's no such thing as two."
2, 16, Bender, "I know what this is about. My body loved me, and I turned it's back on it. Well, old friend, tie a yellow ribbon round your neck, 'cause I'm a-comin' home!"
2, 16, Bender, "You sold my body? To who?"
2, 16, Pawnbroker, "I can't reveal that information, but you look like a nice robot. Tell you what, I'll give you 50 bucks for the kid."
2, 16, Fry, "Hey, my clothes are worth 50 bucks!"
2, 16, Pawnbroker, "Deal."
2, 16, Bender, "Oh! How could I let this happen? I can't go through the rest of my life like this."
2, 16, Farnsworth, "Don't you have a self-destruct button?"
2, 16, Bender, "Yeah, but it's on my body. What am I gonna do?"
2, 16, Fry, "Ah, I can't stand to see a robot cry. Let's watch TV!"
2, 16, Nixon, "And so, ladies and gentlemen, I'm throwing my head into the ring. I'm announcing my candidacy for the presidency of Earth."
2, 16, Journalist #1, "Just one question."
2, 16, Scoop Chang, "Scoop Chang, Beijing Bugle. Sir, the constitution clearly states that nobody can be elected president more than twice."
2, 16, Nixon, "That's right. Nobody.  But as you can plainly see, I've got a shiny new body!"
2, 16, Bender, "Oh!"
2, 16, Leela, "Bender, he's got your body!"
2, 16, Bender, "That dirty, double-crossing bastard! How dare he run off with Richard Nixon!"
2, 16, Leela, "Nixon must have bought your body from the pawn shop."
2, 16, Fry, "Yeah, and that electric guitar."
2, 16, Nixon, "Remember what the dormouse said,Feed your head.(talking) I'm meeting you half way, you stupid hippies!  I am not a crook's head!"
2, 16, Bender, "Yeah, you are, you stole my body! Fry, Leela, you gotta help me!"
2, 16, Leela, "Ordinarily I'd say no and lecture you on how this is your own fault for being such an idiot. But when a robotic Nixon is on the loose, we have a duty to take action. Idiot."
2, 16, Morbo, "Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates"
2, 16, Nixon, "Hello, Morbo. How's the family?"
2, 16, Morbo, "Belligerent and numerous."
2, 16, Nixon, "Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family."
2, 16, Bender, "Great. First he steals my body, now he's touching my stuff."
2, 16, Leela, "Come on. We've gotta find some way to talk to him."
2, 16, Morbo, "Morbo demands an answer to the following question"
2, 16, Johnson, "Unthinkable."
2, 16, Jackson, "I wouldn't think of it."
2, 16, Morbo, "What about you, Mr. Nixon? I remind you, you are under a truth-o-scope."
2, 16, Nixon, "Uh, well, I, uh ... the question is-is vague. You don't say what kind of candy, whether anyone is watching or, uh...  At any rate, I certainly wouldn't harm the child."
2, 16, Nixon's campaign manager, "You scored big points tonight, sir."
2, 16, Nixon, "What are you talking about? They ate me alive out there."
2, 16, Nixon's campaign manager, "Yes, but your body stayed on message. And that message is, ""Look at my shiny new body"". The robots ate it up. You've got real charisma from the neck down."
2, 16, Nixon, "Nixon with charisma? My God, I can rule the universe!"
2, 16, Bender, "Give me my body back, you two-bit thief!"
2, 16, Nixon, "Now, look here, you drugged-out Communist. I paid for this body and I'd no sooner return it than I would my little cocker spaniel dog, Checkers.  Shut up, damnit!"
2, 16, Fry, "Please, Mr. Nixon. We're appealing to your sense of decency."
2, 16, Bender, "That was a good one!"
2, 16, Nixon, "Seriously though, I'm never giving back this body. Now beat it! Before I get Cambodian on your asses!"
2, 16, Bender, "It's hopeless. We might as well turn in my head for the five cent deposit."
2, 16, Fry, "No way! I'm not letting my best friend get recycled. Not for five cents, not for five hundred cents! Leela, I've got a plan!"
2, 16, Leela, "I've got a better plan."
2, 16, Fry, "Why would Nixon stay at the Watergate?"
2, 16, Leela, "They give you a discount if you've been here before."
2, 16, Fry, "Keep going, we're right behind you."
2, 16, Bender, "Whoa, mama! Get a room, you two!"
2, 16, Man, "We're in a room!"
2, 16, Bender, "Well then lose some weight."
2, 16, Nixon, "Aroo!"
2, 16, Nixon, "Oh, yeah. You women's libbers really know how to party!"
2, 16, Bender, "Psst! There I am!"
2, 16, Nixon, "Hey, Betty Friedan, send a little of that lotion my way!"
2, 16, Leela, "OK, almost got it. Steady. Steady. Don't panic."
2, 16, Fry, "Ooh!  Uh-oh!"
2, 16, Nixon, "What the--  You shaggy peaceniks have some nerve!"
2, 16, Bender, "I'm just here for what's mine. Don't make me kick your neck."
2, 16, Nixon, "Bring it on, soup can."
2, 16, Leela, "Alright, break it up, you two!"
2, 16, Nixon, "That's it. You're all going to jail. And don't expect me to grant a pardon like that sissy, Ford."
2, 16, Leela, "You'll never pardon anybody because you'll never get elected president. The voters of Earth aren't the pea-brained idiots they were back in your time."
2, 16, Nixon, "Oh, no? Well, listen here, missy. Computers may be twice as fast as they were in 1973 but your average voter is as drunk and stupid as ever. The only one who's changed is me. I've become bitter and, let's face it, crazy over the years. And once I'm swept into office, I'll sell our children's organs to zoos for meat and I'll go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place."
2, 16, Fry, "Well, he lost my vote."
2, 16, Nixon, "Like one vote ever made a difference. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to inch myself over to the phone and call the police."
2, 16, Bender, "Not so fast, Nixon! Are you familiar with audio tape?"
2, 16, Nixon, "Uh-oh. I don't like where this is heading."
2, 16, Nixon, "And I'll go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place!"
2, 16, Nixon, "My God? I really sound like that? I thought my voice had more of a Clark Gable quality."
2, 16, Leela, "The jig's up, Nixon. We'll trade you the tape for the body."
2, 16, Nixon, "Oh, expletive deleted. You've got a deal."
2, 16, Fry, "Hey, I've got one last thought."
2, 16, Bender, "Ah, it's good to be back in one piece again. Except I can't get these damn bumper stickers off."
2, 16, Linda, "The sheer drama of this election has driven voter turnout to its highest level in centuries. 6%"
2, 16, Morbo, "Exit polls show evil underdog Richard Nixon trailing with an estimated zero votes."
2, 16, Leela, "Yes! The system works!"
2, 16, Linda, "The time is 7"
2, 16, Leela, "No!"
2, 16, Fry, "What?"
2, 16, Bender, "Get out of town!"
2, 16, Fry, "Why would robots vote for Nixon now that he's just a head in a jar?"
2, 16, Nixon's campaign manager, "I give you the next president of Earth!"
2, 16, Nixon, "Nixon's back!"
2, 16, Farnsworth, "I can't believe it. He won by a single vote."
2, 16, Bender, "Well it ain't my fault. I'm a non-voting felon, thank you."
2, 16, Fry, "Well it's not my fault either 'cause I forgot to vote."
2, 16, Leela, "Oh, crud. I knew there was something I meant to do today."
2, 16, Morbo, "Morbo congratulates our gargantuan cyborg president. May death come quickly to his enemies."
2, 16, Nixon, "Aroo! Who's kicking who around now?  Aroo! Aroo!"
2, 16, Nixon, "Knock, knock!"
2, 17, Announcer, "Ladies and gentlemen, Conan O'Brien's head."
2, 17, O'Brien, "Thank you, thank you. Let's get started. Max, play me over.  Looks like someone forgot to feed Max.  So, people are getting pretty worried about this Y2K problem, huh?"
2, 17, Bender, "No, they fixed that 900 years ago."
2, 17, O'Brien, "Just bear with me, sir. Anyway, I'm walking to work this morning--"
2, 17, Bender, "I doubt it!"
2, 17, O'Brien, "Listen, pal, I may have lost my freakishly long legs in the war of 2012 but I've still got something you'll never have"
2, 17, Bender, "Eh."
2, 17, O'Brien, "And freckles!  Well, I'm out of material. You can catch me next week at the Andromeda Chuckle Hut. Enjoy your breakfast."
2, 17, Bender, "Ah, let's face it"
2, 17, Farnsworth, "Come on, everyone. Perhaps some skiing will help us forget the mouldy old antics of Conan O'Brien."
2, 17, Amy, "Yeah!"
2, 17, Leela, "Great idea!"
2, 17, Zoidberg, "We can only hope!"
2, 17, Fry, "This snow is beautiful. I'm glad global warming never happened."
2, 17, Leela, "Actually it did. But thank God nuclear winter cancelled it out."
2, 17, Fry, "Hi!"
2, 17, Bender, "Enough of your mindless chitchat, let's get going."
2, 17, Hermes, "Jah damnit! We're stuck."
2, 17, Zoidberg, "At least you're not cold-blooded!"
2, 17, Hermes, "Sweet lion of Zion! Look at the Professor go."
2, 17, Fry, "Look out! We're heading straight for those trees!"
2, 17, Leela, "Yeah, yeah, relax. Trees down."
2, 17, Trees, "Trees down."
2, 17, Fry, "Cool. Hey, what do you do if you want the trees up?"
2, 17, Trees, "Trees up."
2, 17, Fry, "Trees down!"
2, 17, Trees, "Trees down."
2, 17, Bender, "Lookin' good, meatball!"
2, 17, Man #1, "Excuse me, sir, you're snowboarding off the trail."
2, 17, Bender, "Lick my frozen, metal ass.  Uh-oh!"
2, 17, Child, "Mommy!"
2, 17, Zoidberg, "You, a bobsledder? That I'd like to see!"
2, 17, Hermes, "Listen, you filthy crab, a thousand years ago there was a legendary team of Jamaican bobsledders."
2, 17, Fry, "Yup, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics then retired to promote alcoholic beverages."
2, 17, Hermes, "A true inspiration for the children.  Um, a little help please?   Nooo!"
2, 17, Fry, "Oh, what the hell!  Ow!"
2, 17, Amy, "You poor man. What happened to you?"
2, 17, Man #2, "Well, there I was on the triple diamond slope, when suddenly--"
2, 17, Amy, "Oh, excuse me.  Hello, there!"
2, 17, Farnsworth, "Wha?"
2, 17, Bender, "Ah! Nothing like a warm fire and a Super Soaker of fine cognac."
2, 17, Fry, "Yeah, it really puts you in the Christmas spirit."
2, 17, Farnsworth, "What-mas?"
2, 17, Fry, "Christmas. You know? X-M-A-S."
2, 17, Leela, "Oh, you mean Xmas. You must be using an archaic pronunciation. Like when you say ""ask"" instead of ""aks""."
2, 17, Fry, "Xmas, huh?  Y'know, this'll be my first Xmas away from home."
2, 17, Leela, "Hey, hey. Let me aks you something"
2, 17, Fry, "Yeah! An old-fashioned Xmas tree!"
2, 17, Fry, "Hey! These aren't Xmas trees!"
2, 17, Farnsworth, "Eh, wha?"
2, 17, Fry, "They're supposed to be some kinda, you know, pine tree."
2, 17, Farnsworth, "Pine trees have been extinct for 800 years, Fry. Gone the way of the poodle and your primitive notions of modesty.  Ah! Brisk!"
2, 17, Fry, "This isn't the way Christmas is supposed to be."
2, 17, Farnsworth, "There, there."
2, 17, Fry, "Everything's changed."
2, 17, Leela, "That's not true."
2, 17, Bender, ""
2, 17, Amy, "Ow!"
2, 17, Fry, "Every Christmas my mom would get a fresh goose for goose burgers and my dad would whip up his special eggnog out of bourbon and ice cubes.  This dumb holiday just makes me think of all the things I left behind. Let's just stop talking about Xmas."
2, 17, Hermes, "Happy Xmas, Xmas people! Xmas cards have arrived! Xmas!  Amy, there you go. Fry, Professor, Zoidberg, a mighty haul for Bender."
2, 17, Bender, "Yes! I got the most! I win Xmas!"
2, 17, Hermes, "And last, but not least, the sweet flower of the office"
2, 17, Bender, "Hmm.  Ah, a picture of my mommy."
2, 17, Zoidberg, "Huh? What's this?  A card from my cousin Zoidfarb.  Instead of ""Claus"" he writes ""Claws""! Now that's humorous. Today's comedians could learn from this card."
2, 17, Fry, "What's the point of Xmas when everyone you know died a thousand years ago? I'm the loneliest person on Earth.  Hey, Leela, how 'bout a little sympathy here, huh?  Yoiks! What was that about?"
2, 17, Amy, "Fluh! She's an orphan."
2, 17, Farnsworth, "Yes, and the only one of her species in all the known universe. What a lonely life."
2, 17, Fry, "My God! Poor Leela."
2, 17, Bender, "Hey, buddy, heard you needed cheering up! Well, old Bender'll make you laugh.  Look at me, look!  Oh, man, I gotta work on my act!"
2, 17, Fry, "I feel like a rat. Here I am whining like a pig while all along Leela was lonely as a frog. I could kick myself."
2, 17, Amy, "I'll do it for you."
2, 17, Fry, "Ow! Thanks."
2, 17, Farnsworth, "You should be ashamed of yourself, Fry. You'd have to be blind not to notice that Leela's a cyclops."
2, 17, Hermes, "Fry's over there, man."
2, 17, Farnsworth, "Oh?"
2, 17, Bender, "Xmas Eve; another pointless day where I accomplish nothing."
2, 17, Linda, "The holiday season is a time of celebration for most. But it is also a time to remember the tragic suffering of the less fortunate."
2, 17, Morbo, "Earthlings do not yet know the meaning of suffering."
2, 17, Linda, "Earlier today I visited a shelter for down-and-out robots.  Homeless robots, too poor to afford even the basic alcohol they need to fuel their circuits. Is there anything sadder? Only drowning puppies. And there would have to be a lot of them."
2, 17, Amy, "Where are you going, Bender?"
2, 17, Bender, "To volunteer at a liquor kitchen for homeless robots."
2, 17, Hermes, "Yeah, right! As if you ever did anything charitable."
2, 17, Bender, "I'm very generous. What about that time I gave blood?"
2, 17, Fry, "Whose blood?"
2, 17, Bender, "Some guy's."
2, 17, Fry, "I've got to do something to show Leela how sorry I am."
2, 17, Zoidberg, "So what's the problem? Just get down on your claws and do the apology dance."
2, 17, Fry, "So it's left, left, right-- Wait! I have a better idea! I'll go out and get her the perfect Xmas present. Something so great she'll never want to be unhappy again."
2, 17, Hermes, "Just be back by sundown, mon."
2, 17, Fry, "We'll see. I like to haggle."
2, 17, Amy, "You can't stay out on Xmas Eve. You'll be killed!"
2, 17, Fry, "Say what?"
2, 17, Farnsworth, "Good Lord! He doesn't know about Santa Claus."
2, 17, Fry, "I know about Santa Claus."
2, 17, Farnsworth, "Back in 2801, the Friendly Robot Company built a robotic Santa to determine who'd be naughty and who'd been nice and distribute presents accordingly. But something went wrong."
2, 17, Fry, "Wow! 2801! Anyway..."
2, 17, Farnsworth, "Wait, you fool! Due to a programming error, Santa's standards were set too high and he invariably judges everyone to be naughty."
2, 17, Amy, "If he catches you after dark, he'll chop off your head and stuff your neck full of toys from his sack of horrors."
2, 17, Farnsworth, "Nice meeting you."
2, 17, Preacherbot, "Welcome, brother! May the blessings of the season be upon you."
2, 17, Bender, "Yeah, yeah, amen. Listen, I'm one of those lazy homeless bums I've been hearing about. Could you point me to the free booze.  Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!"
2, 17, Fry, "There's this girl who I really like but she thinks I'm a jerk. Can you help me?"
2, 17, Salesman #1, "Yeah, there's a suicide booth in the food court. Though there's a line this time of year."
2, 17, Fry, "No, I need to get her a gift. And I need it before sundown."
2, 17, Salesman #1, "Well, you can't go wrong with something traditional.  A Surface-to-Santa rocket launcher. It comes with three jolly-seeking missiles."
2, 17, Fry, "That's funny!"
2, 17, Salesman #1, "Careful, sir!"
2, 17, Bender, "Oh, yeah! You filthy hobos sure know how to live.  Hey, chief, someone's stealing your handkerchief full of crap."
2, 17, Tinny Tim, "Excuse me, sir? Might I have a sip of booze?"
2, 17, Preacherbot, "I'm sorry, Tinny Tim. Seems we ran out early tonight."
2, 17, Tinny Tim, "I understand."
2, 17, Bender, "My God! That poor kid!"
2, 17, Fry, "You're the last store open. I need something for my friend Leela.  Just give me your best animal."
2, 17, Salesman #2, "Best? Well that's a matter of opinion. I personally like the Electric Snail."
2, 17, Fry, "That's a stupid animal. You're stupid! I said I want the best one. Now which costs more? The parrot or the Stink Lizard?"
2, 17, Salesman #2, "The lizards are a buck each, the parrot is $500."
2, 17, Fry, "That's a hell of a good parrot. Although, I could get 500 lizards for the same price. Girls like swarms of lizards, right?"
2, 17, Salesman #2, "Sir, the store is closing in two minutes."
2, 17, Fry, "Alright, I'll take the 500 lizards. No, wait, yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes! The parrot!"
2, 17, Fry, "Well, I spent every penny I had but I bet Leela's gonna love you.  Hey, you're quite the talker, aren't you?  Shut the hell up!  Ow!  Stupid bird! I know where you live."
2, 17, Amy, "Hey, it's Leela."
2, 17, Leela, "Sorry I stormed out before. I didn't mean to ruin everyone's Xmas."
2, 17, Farnsworth, "Huh? You were gone?"
2, 17, Leela, "It's just that I get tired of Fry always only thinking of himself."
2, 17, Hermes, "I hear that! I aks him to set the table, instead he goes out to buy you a present. Selfish dog."
2, 17, Leela, "Wait! You mean he's still out? His life's in danger!"
2, 17, Zoidberg, "Why?"
2, 17, Leela, "I'm telling you why. Santa Claus is coming to town!"
2, 17, Fry, "Alright, bird, you thought you could beat me in a game of wits. But you just met your equal."
2, 17, Fry, "Aha! Cornered!"
2, 17, Leela, "Hi, there!"
2, 17, Fry, "Leela! Oh, my God! You saved my life. I am gonna get you so many lizards!"
2, 17, Leela, "You didn't need to buy me a present, Fry."
2, 17, Fry, "I just wanted to do something to make you happy. I mean, I miss my family but you never even had a family."
2, 17, Leela, "It's OK. You're lonely and I'm lonely. But, together, we're lonely together."
2, 17, Fry, "Merry Xmas, Leela."
2, 17, Leela, "Merry Xmas."
2, 17, Fry, "Oh, boy! It's Santa!"
2, 17, Santa, "Ho, ho, ho!  You've been very naughty, Fry and Leela. I checked my list."
2, 17, Fry, "Well check it twice!"
2, 17, Santa, "I perform over 50 mega-checks per second. You're both naughty for disregarding each other's feelings."
2, 17, Leela, "But we set things right. Fry even risked his life to get me a present."
2, 17, Santa, "But what about your other co-workers? Did either of you ever stop to think about Dr. Zoidberg's feelings?"
2, 17, Fry, "No! I swear!"
2, 17, Santa, "Santa has something very special in his sack for you two!"
2, 17, Robots, "So lock the door and hit the floor,'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight."
2, 17, Hattie, "Go away!"
2, 17, Bender, "Whoa, hold on! How about inviting us in for a traditional glass of hard cider?"
2, 17, Hattie, "Oh, alright. But just one glass!   OK, that's enough.  I said that's enough!"
2, 17, Bender, "Get her purse!"
2, 17, Fry, "Please let us live! We'll put out milk and cookies for you!"
2, 17, Santa, "You dare bribe Santa? I'm going to shove coal so far up your stocking you'll be coughing up diamonds!"
2, 17, Leela, "We're trapped."
2, 17, Fry, "I never thought it would end this way"
2, 17, Leela, "Goodbye, Fry."
2, 17, Fry, "Goodbye, Leela.  Hey, look, we're under the mistletoe."
2, 17, Santa, "Your mistletoe is no match for my T.O.W. missile!"
2, 17, Fry, "Uh, you're present may need some assembly."
2, 17, Bender, "On the 4th day of Xmas I stole from that lady."
2, 17, Robot #1, "Four family photos."
2, 17, Tinny Tim, "Three jars of pennies."
2, 17, Robot #2, "Two former husbands."
2, 17, Bender, "And a slipper on a shoe tree."
2, 17, Raoul, "Oh, thank you!"
2, 17, Fry, "Help!"
2, 17, Leela, "Somebody help us."
2, 17, Tinny Tim, "It's humans. Shall we mug them, robot sir?"
2, 17, Bender, "No, wait, I know these guys. They got nothing."
2, 17, Santa, "Ho, ho, ho!  You've been very naughty, Bender."
2, 17, Bender, "What? Me? I didn't do nothing. You're thinking of the kid."
2, 17, Santa, "My God, Bender! Framing an orphan? That's so naughty I'll have to add it to my list right now.  Framing ... I-N-G ...  ... an..."
2, 17, Zoidberg, "Amy, this is for you. A set of combs for your beautiful hair."
2, 17, Amy, "Oh, that's so sweet. But I sold my hair to a wigmaker so I could buy a set of combs for Hermes."
2, 17, Hermes, "Oh, the irony. I sold my hair so I could buy this third set of combs for Zoidberg."
2, 17, Zoidberg, "Thank you. These'll come in handy for my new hair.  Finally I look as pretty as I feel!"
2, 17, Fry, "Help!"
2, 17, Leela, "Help!"
2, 17, Bender, "Help!"
2, 17, Farnsworth, "Oh, dear. They'll be killed on our doorstep. And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd."
2, 17, Hermes, "Sweet manatee of Galilee! He's on the roof!"
2, 17, Farnsworth, "Quick! The armour-plated chimney cover!  Push! Push!"
2, 17, Bender, "Use teamwork!"
2, 17, Tinny Tim, "Oh, dear! Oh, dear!"
2, 17, Santa, "You've all been very naughty, very naughty indeed. Except you, Dr. Zoidberg, this is for you."
2, 17, Zoidberg, "A pogo-stick!"
2, 17, Santa, "As for the rest of you, I'm going to tear off your skin like wrapping paper and deck the halls with your guts."
2, 17, Bender, "Yeah? Well I don't believe in Santa Claus. Come on, everybody, if you don't believe in him, he can't hurt you.  Ow! God! The pain!"
2, 17, Santa, "Ho, ho, ho! Time to get jolly on your naughty asses!"
2, 17, Leela, "Watch out! His belly is shaking like a bowl full of nitro-glycerine!"
2, 17, Amy, "Rudolph's nose!"
2, 17, Fry, "He's gonna blow!"
2, 17, Zoidberg, "Aha!"
2, 17, Farnsworth, "Yes, good thing I got us out of that one!"
2, 17, Bender, "Xmas dinner, everyone."
2, 17, Fry, "Uh, Bender? Where did you get that bird?"
2, 17, Bender, "I found it lying in the street, like all the food I cook. Dig in, everyone."
2, 17, Tinny Tim, "Thank you, sir."
2, 17, Bender, "You got the toenail!  Oh!"
2, 17, Fry, "Look, the food isn't what's important."
2, 17, Tinny Tim, "I'm so hungry."
2, 17, Fry, "The important thing is we're all together for Xmas. And even though I'm surrounded by robots and monsters and old people, I've never felt more at home."
2, 17, Farnsworth, "Hear, hear! Now let's all of us shut up and sing!"
2, 17, Amy, "He knows when you are sleeping."
2, 17, Farnsworth, "He knows when you're on the can."
2, 17, Leela, "He'll hunt you down and blast your ass from here to Pakistan."
2, 17, Zoidberg, "Oh."
2, 17, Hermes, "You'd better not breathe, You'd better not move."
2, 17, Bender, "You're better off dead, I'm telling you, dude."
2, 17, Fry, "Santa Claus is gunning you down!"
2, 17, Farnsworth, "Merry Xmas, everyone!"
2, 17, Santa, "I'll be back. Back when you least expect it"
2, 18, Singer, "Call Robo-Rooter when you flush your towel."
2, 18, Plumber-bot, "And we can also help with an impacted bowel."
2, 18, Singer, "Robo-Rooter!"
2, 18, Fry, "Mmm. Mmm! Now this is what I call a thousand years of progress"
2, 18, Bender, "Aw, jeez. Let's just pray I have the energy to get myself another beer.  Oh, what is this, the Middle Ages?"
2, 18, Leela, "Look at you guys. No offence, Fry, but you've become a fat sack of crap."
2, 18, Fry, "Sack?"
2, 18, Amy, "And, Bender, your beer belly's so big your door won't even close. And that doesn't even make sense."
2, 18, Leela, "Come on. We're taking you pigs to the gym."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "The gymnasium? Excellent, excellent. For some reason I'm frisky as a squid on Tuesday."
2, 18, Amy, "Hey, who's up for a nice, hot steam?"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "We crustaceans don't like steam. I'm going to go work out with the Nautilus!"
2, 18, Nautilus, "What up, Dr. Z?"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Yo, yo, yo! Whassup, whassup! Give up the rock!"
2, 18, Fry, "Co-ed steam rooms! I love the future!"
2, 18, Leela, "Uh, Fry, you're in the women's steam room."
2, 18, Fry, "Ah, futuristic!"
2, 18, Amy, "Psst, look what life was like before genetic engineering."
2, 18, Leela, "Those poor 20th century women."
2, 18, Amy, "Hey, handsome. Is there room in there for two?"
2, 18, Man, "You wish!"
2, 18, Fry, "Hey, Leela, look who's the super-stud!"
2, 18, Leela, "Hmm, somebody must have turned down the gravity. I'll fix it for you."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Give me that.  More weight!"
2, 18, Fry, "Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, what's that jazz on your head?"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Enough with the questions. More weight!  More!  More!"
2, 18, Leela, "Maybe you could do more reps with less weight."
2, 18, Bender, "Hey, looks like Zoidberg's finally coming out of his shell.  Get it?  He's coming out--"
2, 18, Randy, "Nice and gentle, we don't want any unnecessary stress.  Is there a doctor in the gym?"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "I'm a doctor!"
2, 18, Leela, "I wonder why Dr. Zoidberg is acting this way. Out of all of us he always seemed the most normal."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "I am normal.  Amy, take off these rubber bands and I'll show you how normal I am!"
2, 18, Amy, "Fool me seven times, shame on you. Fool me eight or more times, shame on me."
2, 18, Fry, "Maybe he has a parasite."
2, 18, Hermes, "Maybe he is a parasite!"
2, 18, Bender, "It's always so sad when a friend goes crazy and you have to have a big clam-bake and cook him! Yee-haw!"
2, 18, Farnsworth, "Now, now, this won't do. Let me just give old Zoidy a sedative."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Ah, much better. You can take off these rubber bands now."
2, 18, Amy, "I'll do it."
2, 18, Leela, "Stop!"
2, 18, Fry, "No, Amy!"
2, 18, Bender, "Moron!"
2, 18, Farnsworth, "Mm-hm...  Oh-ho!  Aha! There's the problem."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Give it to me straight, Professor. Is it fin rot? It's fin rot, isn't it? Tell me it's not fin rot!"
2, 18, Farnsworth, "Relax, my chiton-y chum. There's no problem. You're just heavy with male jelly."
2, 18, Leela, "Bleck!"
2, 18, Farnsworth, "It must be mating season for Zoidberg's people; a chaotic time when his behaviour is dictated by the tiny brain in his rump."
2, 18, Fry, "Eck!"
2, 18, Farnsworth, "There's only one thing we can do--"
2, 18, Bender, "I'll get the water boiling!"
2, 18, Farnsworth, "We, by which I mean you, will have to rush him to his ancient homeworld which will shortly erupt in an orgy of invertebrate sex."
2, 18, Fry, "Oh, baby, I'm there!"
2, 18, Leela, "Fry, do you even understand the word ""invertebrate""?"
2, 18, Fry, "Nope, but that's not the word I'm interested in.  Uh, no need to pack pants, people. Let's roll!"
2, 18, Amy, "Dr. Zoidberg said I should hold these while he's gone."
2, 18, Bender, "Moron!"
2, 18, Decapodian Man #1, "Welcome home, old friend. Just 19 hours until the mating frenzy!"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Excellent, excellent!"
2, 18, Decapodian Man #1, "See you there, Doctor--"
2, 18, Fry, "Is that how you say ""Zoidberg""?"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "You didn't have to call attention to his speech impediment."
2, 18, Bender, "You're looking less nuts, crabby."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "I'm feeling less nuts, thank you, because tomorrow I will be depositing my jelly in the cloacal vents of a female.  If you catch my drift."
2, 18, Fry, "Who's the lucky lobsterina?"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "I don't know yet. But I shall attract one this afternoon with an erotic display."
2, 18, Leela, "It's amazing that your people can fall in love so fast."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Love? That word is unknown here. I'm simply looking for a female swollen with eggs to accept my genetic material."
2, 18, Fry, "You and me both, brother!"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Ah, my old scuttling grounds! Let's pull over."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "I used to hang out here as a larva. It looked so much bigger back then.  Who's the tough guy now, Vinnie?"
2, 18, Bender, "Look! Outdoor theatre! Let's get tickets. Oh, let's do!"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "No, it's the ceremony of Claw-Plach, where my species fight to the death over matters of honour. Also whether abbreviations count in Scrabble.  They don't!"
2, 18, Fry, "I didn't come here to see any activity involving two guys. Where do you people do your erotic display?"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Same place as your species"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "How do I look?"
2, 18, Bender, "Like whale barf."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Then the illusion is complete."
2, 18, Fry, "Hey, I wonder if these guys are here to watch the erotic display too."
2, 18, Decapodian Man #2, "Aw, yeah! Aw, wow!"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Perfect! This oughta make me stand out.  Craw!"
2, 18, Fry, "Look how ridiculous they look."
2, 18, Bender, "Please, he's no different from the rest of you organisms; shooting DNA at each other make babies. I find it offensive."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Craw!"
2, 18, Decapodian Woman #1, "Keep your jelly away from my eggs!"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Craw?"
2, 18, Decapodian Woman #2, "So not interested."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Craw!"
2, 18, Decapodian Woman #3, "Humph. I've heard that line before!"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Cra-- Oh, what's the point?"
2, 18, Leela, "Why is Zoidberg the only one still alone?"
2, 18, Bender, "'Cause he's a loser, that's why. He's the lobster equivalent of Fry."
2, 18, Fry, "Hey! I can get any girl I want anytime I want. I'm just too busy."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Edna? Edna, it's me, Zoidberg. Remember, from high school?  You used to laugh at me because my face was covered with barnacles!"
2, 18, Edna, "Zoidberg? Well I didn't know you were back in town. I heard you went off and became a rich doctor."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "I've performed a few mercy killings. So, as long as I'm in town I was wondering if maybe ... craw?"
2, 18, Edna, "Oh, gee, yeah, I'm just going through a lot of things right now and-- Look, Zoidberg, I carry more eggs than any other female and I owe it to our race to pick a mate who's stuffed with male jelly. Maybe a rock star."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Or maybe a doctor?"
2, 18, Edna, "I'm sorry, Zoidberg. You're just an inferior male specimen. Nice seeing you again."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "No one will ever want to mate with me, not with a puny claw like this. Did you see those other guys? They looked like giant claws with bodies attached."
2, 18, Leela, "At least you didn't smell as bad as them."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "You're right, my stink gland is weak. Smell!"
2, 18, Fry, "Listen, Doc, if you wanna score you gotta fake like you're in love.  Just look her in the eye, start crying and say  ""I've never been so happy."""
2, 18, Leela, "If a guy ever did that to me I'd know it. Wait a second. They've all been doing that to me. Even Sean!"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Hmm, this ""love"" intrigues me. Teach me to fake it."
2, 18, Fry, "OK, you're on a date. What's the first thing you do?"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Ask her to mate with me."
2, 18, Fry, "No. Tell her she's special."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "But she's not. She's merely the female with the largest clutch of eggs."
2, 18, Fry, "Well, tell her that. And then?"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Then mating."
2, 18, Fry, "No. Make up some feelings and tell her you have them.  Yes?"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Is ""desire to mate"" a feeling?"
2, 18, Fry, "You're not even trying!"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "It's all so complicated with the flowers and the romance and the lies upon lies."
2, 18, Fry, "OK, OK, don't worry. The love meister will take you under his wing."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "What? Now there's a bird involved?"
2, 18, Fry, "OK, go ahead."
2, 18, Edna, "What the-- Dr. Zoidberg, your mating display failed. Why are you trying to talk to me?"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "I have no idea."
2, 18, Fry, "You just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "I just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating.  Fry, that doesn't make sense."
2, 18, Edna, "Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But OK."
2, 18, Fry, "Start with a compliment. Tell her she looks thin."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from internal parasites?"
2, 18, Edna, "Why, yes. Thanks for noticing."
2, 18, Fry, "Now ask her how her day was."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Why would I wanna know?"
2, 18, Fry, "You wouldn't. Ask anyway."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "How was your day?"
2, 18, Edna, "Well first I got up and had a piece of toast. Then I brushed my teeth. Then I went to the store to buy some fish. Then..."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Fry, look what you did, she won't shut up."
2, 18, Fry, "That's normal. Just nod your head and say ""Uh-huh""."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Uh-huh, uh-huh."
2, 18, Edna, "...And then you threw an octopus at my window. You know, Zoidberg, it's crazy but when you talk this way your obvious deficiencies as a male seem ... less obvious. Your genes seem less detrimental.  You even stink more."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Do I ask her to mate now?"
2, 18, Fry, "Third date!"
2, 18, Bender, "So I returned his artificial heart and ever since then I've been known by the name of Honest Bender."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "I'd like to propose a toast to ... coat check number 84."
2, 18, Fry, "Turn it over."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Oh, Edna!  Of all the slimy, gross crab monsters on this planet, you are apparently the hottest."
2, 18, Bender, "Oy."
2, 18, Fry, "That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard."
2, 18, Edna, "Yes, well ... excuse me, I've got to powder my mouth flaps."
2, 18, Leela, "Uh, me too."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "I'm confused, Fry. I'm feeling a strange new emotion. Is it love when you care about a female for reasons beyond mating?"
2, 18, Fry, "Nope. Must be some weird alien emotion."
2, 18, Leela, "Zoidberg said some dumb stuff but he's a nice guy, really. It's just that Fry's been telling him what to say and Fry's a ... do you have idiots on your planet?"
2, 18, Edna, "Fry? You mean words of such beauty came from the blowhole of that hideous alien?"
2, 18, Leela, "Yeah ... what? Look, never mind the words. Zoidberg's a doctor. A doctor, honey."
2, 18, Edna, "Hmm."
2, 18, Edna, "Come in."
2, 18, Edna, "Hello, Fry. Can I interest you in some surf and turf?"
2, 18, Fry, "No thanks. I just came to tell you that Zoidberg's really great. He's got male jelly coming out the wazoo."
2, 18, Edna, "Well that is where it comes out but jelly isn't everything.  I know Zoidberg's magical words were really yours. Teach me to love you, squishy poet from beyond the stars!"
2, 18, Fry, "Uh, I'm flattered, really. If I was gonna do it with a big, freaky mud bug you'd be way up the list!"
2, 18, Edna, "Hush, you romantic fool! Engage your mandibles and kiss me!"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Edna, I couldn't stand it any longer. I--   Fry!"
2, 18, Fry, "Dr. Zoidberg, it's not how it looks."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Her caviar is on your neck!"
2, 18, Fry, "But--"
2, 18, Edna, "Oh, it's true, Zoidberg. We can't hide it any longer. Fry and I have fallen in love and we're going to mate tomorrow."
2, 18, Fry, "What?"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Fry!  I challenge you to Claw-Plach!"
2, 18, Fry, "English, please?"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "A fight to the death."
2, 18, Edna, "And if you survive, we'll make sweet love!"
2, 18, Decapodian Emperor, "The law is clear. Fry and Zoidberg shall fight to the death for the claw of the beautiful Edna."
2, 18, Fry, "But I don't want her!"
2, 18, Decapodian Emperor, "Once invoked, the sacred tradition of Claw-Plach can not be taken back. It is a recent tradition, only 18 years old, but it is a tradition none the less."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Get ready, Fry. I'm going to rip your swim bladder out and show it to you."
2, 18, Leela, "Dr. Zoidberg, this is madness. You're being irrational."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Of course I'm being irrational! I'm in love!"
2, 18, Leela, "Aww."
2, 18, Fry, "Leela!"
2, 18, Leela, "Right, right.  You have to stop this madness."
2, 18, Decapodian Emperor, "Listen, lady, as you can plainly see I'm a highly desirable male, groaning with jelly. Yet I embrace a life of celibacy in order to uphold our crazy traditions. One of your friends must die."
2, 18, Bender, "Fate is cruel and unyielding and what must be must be.  Takin' all bets! I'm giving 9-2 on Zoidberg, the crab with the jab! The Great Red Hope! Come on, baby!"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Fry, it's been years since medical school so remind me. Disembowelling in your species"
2, 18, Fry, "Fatal."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Large bet on myself in round one!"
2, 18, Decapodian Emperor, "Edna, have you anything to say before begins the Claw-Plach?"
2, 18, Edna, "I do. I just want to say that today I got up and I had a piece of toast. Then I brushed my teeth--"
2, 18, Fry, "Shut up!"
2, 18, Edna, "I love you, Fry!"
2, 18, Decapodian Emperor, "Fry, having guessed what animal I was thinking of, you shall have first choice of weapon.  And you, doctor?"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "I choose my own claws! I want the tactile pleasure of chopping him right here in the gonads!"
2, 18, Fry, "Shh! Nobody correct him!"
2, 18, Bender, "Fry, I've never asked you for anything before but, if it's not too much trouble, when it comes to the ninth round just let him win."
2, 18, Fry, "But it's a fight to the death!"
2, 18, Bender, "Oh, so this is suddenly all about you. Sheesh!"
2, 18, Decapodian Emperor, "Please rise for the national anthem."
2, 18, Fry, "Uh-oh."
2, 18, Decapodian Emperor, "Let Claw-Plach begin!"
2, 18, Fry, "Hey!"
2, 18, Bender, "Ow!"
2, 18, Leela, "Come on, Fry! Die with dignity!"
2, 18, Fry, "Aha!  Oops!"
2, 18, Edna, "Nooo! I can't stand to look."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Huh?"
2, 18, Bender, "Psst, Fry. Take a dive."
2, 18, Crowd, "Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach!  Claw-Plach!  Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach!"
2, 18, Fry, "My fellow fish monsters, far be it for me to question your stupid civilisation or its dumb customs, but is squeezing each other's brains out with a giant nutcracker really going to solve anything? Dr. Zoidberg is my friend, and though a woman has come between us, I say we'll always remain friends. And you know why?  One reason.  You bastard! I'll kill you! You bastard!"
2, 18, Leela, "Wait! Stop! Everyone is gone."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Edna? Honey?"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Edna?"
2, 18, Leela, "Ew!"
2, 18, Bender, "Oh, my God!"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "The frenzy!  Oh, the greatest experience in life and I missed it."
2, 18, Fry, "Aw. I'm sorry, Doc."
2, 18, Fry, "Ow, ow! Ah!"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "The frenzy is over. How will I ever get rid of my male jelly now?"
2, 18, Fry, "I'll lend you this."
2, 18, Leela, "Fry!"
2, 18, Fry, "Hey, hey."
2, 18, Bender, "Shoo! Get away! Hey! What's with the flying jerks?"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "They come to feast after the frenzy. Once my species passes on its genes, it dies."
2, 18, Fry, "You mean you have to choose between a life without sex and a gruesome death?"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Yes."
2, 18, Fry, "Tough call."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Well it was nice of you to let me reattach your arm, Fry, especially after I made a complete eel out of myself."
2, 18, Fry, "No biggie."
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Yes biggie. I learned to feel things I'd never felt before"
2, 18, Leela, "Hooray!"
2, 18, Bender, "Yeah!"
2, 18, Fry, "Yeah!"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "I may not know from emotions but when it comes to medicine, forget about it."
2, 18, Fry, "I don't mean to nitpick, super-doc, but do you think maybe you could take one more whack at this?"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "For you, my friend, anything."
2, 18, Fry, "My legs!"
2, 18, Zoidberg, "Alright, alright, third time's the charm."

2, 19, Bender, "C'mon, Fry, I really wanna see it. You know how I yearn for a simpler time. A time of barn dances and buggy rides, before life was cheapened by heartless hi-tech machines."
2, 19, Leela, "But, Bender, you are--"

2, 19, Fry, "We sometimes called it a jogging suit."
2, 19, Narrator, "The traffic jams of Old New York were a public forum of free interchange of opinions."
2, 19, Motorist #1, "Move it, crap for brains!"
2, 19, Motorist #2, "Bug off!"
2, 19, Motorist #3, "Get home, bastard man!"
2, 19, Narrator, "It all started with Gerald Ford's famous invention, the ""automocar"" ...  ... which was powered by a tank of burning fossils. Here we see a 20th century assembly line where cars were constructed by primitive robots."
2, 19, Robots, "Ooga! Ooga! Ooga! Ooga! Ooga! Ooga..."
2, 19, Bender, "We've come a long way, baby!"
2, 19, Narrator, "The fruit of the robots' labour was this ...  ... the stately 1992 Latoura."
2, 19, Fry, "Hey, my girlfriend had one of those. Actually it wasn't hers, it was her dad's. Actually she wasn't my girlfriend, she just lived next door and never closed her curtains."
2, 19, Leela, "Fry, remember when I told you about always ending your stories a sentence earlier?"
2, 19, Fry, "C'mon, let's sneak in for a closer look."
2, 19, Man, "Sir, we don't touch the antiques. sir. You-- Oh!  I'm sorry. You work here. I should have realised from that ridiculous getup you're wearing."
2, 19, Fry, "Hey! This is from Miller's Outpo-- Uh, I mean, yeah, I work here alright!"
2, 19, Man, "Here, move this rust bucket outside behind St. Koch's Cathedral."
2, 19, Leela, "Did you drive much in the 20th century, Fry?"
2, 19, Fry, "Nope.  No one in New York drove. There was too much traffic.  Nice! Listen to that baby purr."
2, 19, Bender, "There's a baby in there, huh?"
2, 19, Fry, "It's just like riding a bicyc--"
2, 19, Bender, "I think I got whiplash."
2, 19, Leela, "You can't have whiplash, you don't have a neck."
2, 19, Bender, "I meant ass whiplash."
2, 19, Fry, "I'm just glad we hit something. I thought we'd never stop."
2, 19, Bending Unit, "Ow! I think I got whiplash."
2, 19, Fry, "How's that robot I ran over?"
2, 19, Farnsworth, "We did all we could."
2, 19, Fry, "You mean he's--"
2, 19, Farnsworth, "Good as new? Yes!"
2, 19, Farnsworth, "Leela, Zoidberg, the rest of you, this is Flexo."
2, 19, Hermes, "Sweet llamas of the Bahamas! Except for that stylish beard, he looks just like Bender!"
2, 19, Flexo, "No duh, dreadlock, we're both bending units."
2, 19, Bender, "Hey, brobot, what's you serial number?"
2, 19, Flexo, "3370318."
2, 19, Bender, "No way! Mine's 2716057!"
2, 19, Fry, "I don't get it."
2, 19, Bender, "We're both expressible as the sum of two cubes."
2, 19, Fry, "So, uh, Flexo. Sorry about crushing your body like that. You OK now?"
2, 19, Flexo, "Well I don't feel as bad as you look!  Nah, I'm just messing with you, kid. You're alright. That's some face you got, though. I think they got a cream for that.  Nah, you're great."
2, 19, Fry, "Well just let me know if there's anything I can do to make it up to you."
2, 19, Flexo, "Actually, your little stunt did a number on my back. You mind rubbin' it for me?"
2, 19, Fry, "Uh ... sure."
2, 19, Flexo, "Aw, yeah, that's it. Little lower."
2, 19, Fry, "How's that?"
2, 19, Flexo, "Lower.  Yeah that's gettin' it. A little lower though."
2, 19, Fry, "Uh, I can't get any lower than this."
2, 19, Flexo, "I'll say, you're rubbing my ass!"
2, 19, Robot #1, "Hey, check it out here. Six beautiful devices. They know what you like and they'll do it to within a tolerance of one micron!"
2, 19, Robot #2, "Yeah! Spin those fans, baby!"
2, 19, Robot #3, "Alright, mama!"
2, 19, Robot #4, "Gyrate, baby!"
2, 19, Fry, "I don't like this place. It's 120 degrees and there's very little oxygen."
2, 19, Bender, "Shut up and hoot.  Hubba-hubba, she is built -- in Mexico, I believe."
2, 19, Flexo, "And that ain't silicon, it's tungsten. And plenty of it!"
2, 19, Fry, "Uh, yeah. Look at that exhaust fan."
2, 19, Flexo, "Ew!"
2, 19, Bender, "Pervert."
2, 19, Flexo, "Yoo-hoo!"
2, 19, Stripperbot, "Thanks, moderate spender. Please select erotic transaction."
2, 19, Flexo, "Yeah, how 'bout a lap dance for my pal here?"
2, 19, Fry, "Uh, no, no, that's alright.  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!"
2, 19, Fry, "I'm telling you, there's something about Flexo I don't like."
2, 19, Flexo, "Hey, Fry, think fast.  Get it? It's chlorine!"
2, 19, Zoidberg, "It's funny because it's poisonous!"
2, 19, Fry, "Yeah, keep laughing, brine shrimp, but he's bad news. I regret ever running him over."
2, 19, Hermes, "Take a rage dump, man. He's no worse than Bender."
2, 19, Fry, "He's much worse. He drinks and smokes and he posts naked pictures of me on the Internet."
2, 19, Amy, "That's Bender, alright."
2, 19, Fry, "I'm talking about Flexo."
2, 19, Leela, "Oh, I get it. This is cute. You're jealous of Bender's new friend!"
2, 19, Fry, "No, I'm not. Mark my words"
2, 19, Hermes, "Rage dump!"
2, 19, Farnsworth, "Good news, everyone. Report to my bedroom for a private exhibition."
2, 19, Farnsworth, "Everyone get in bed with me. I have something to show you.  Feast your eyes on this!"
2, 19, Leela, "It's beautiful."
2, 19, Amy, "And huge."
2, 19, Fry, "Can I touch it?"
2, 19, Zoidberg, "So what is it, already?"
2, 19, Farnsworth, "It's a single atom of jumbonium, an element so rare the nucleus alone is worth more than $50,000."
2, 19, Bender, "How much more?"
2, 19, Farnsworth, "100,000. That's why I hid it here, under my mattress."
2, 19, Leela, "Uh, Professor, can we discuss this somewhere else?"
2, 19, Farnsworth, "Why certainly."
2, 19, Farnsworth, "The atom sits atop this dimestore tiara which will be awarded to the winner of this year's Miss Universe pageant on the planet Tova 9.  Your job is to deliver it, safe and sound."
2, 19, Amy, "Wow! When I was a little girl on Mars I dreamed of being Miss Universe."
2, 19, Leela, "That's kinda pathetic."
2, 19, Amy, "Aw, come on, Leela. Deep down all girls wanna be Miss Universe."
2, 19, Leela, "Not me."
2, 19, Amy, "Really? Maybe it's just cute girls."
2, 19, Farnsworth, "Due to the atoms tremendous value, Planet Express would go bankrupt if it was stolen. Therefore we'll need to hire on additional security for the mission."
2, 19, Flexo, "Oh, oh, oh, oh! Mr. Professor, right here!"
2, 19, Fry, "Uh, maybe we should stick with people we know and trust. I mean, Flexo's great, but--"
2, 19, Farnsworth, """Flexo's great,"" you say? Well that's good enough for me.  Welcome aboard, lad."
2, 19, Leela, "Space bandidos have been operating in this quadrant so you'll each take 8-hour shifts guarding the safe. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry."
2, 19, Fry, "Wait, hold on. I don't like the sound of that. Let's just go alphabetically."
2, 19, Leela, "OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry."
2, 19, Fry, "Wait, let's go by rank."
2, 19, Leela, "OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry."
2, 19, Fry, "Flexo outranks me?"
2, 19, Flexo, "That's ""Flexo outranks me, sir""!"
2, 19, Bender, "Halt. Who goes there?"
2, 19, Fry, "Don't point that at me."
2, 19, Bender, """Fry"" who?"
2, 19, Fry, "Look, I know Flexo's your friend but I don't trust him alone with the atom."
2, 19, Bender, "My God, Fry! Just 'cause the guy's got a beard you label him as evil? Well I got a label for you, pal"
2, 19, Fry, "I'm not prejudiced."
2, 19, Bender, "Ah, save it for the cross-burning, Adolf!"
2, 19, Flexo, "Keeping an eye on the safe?"
2, 19, Bender, "You know it!"
2, 19, Flexo, "Well, looks like it's my shift. You lie down and go offline for a while."
2, 19, Bender, "Alright."
2, 19, Fry, "Caught you!  I saw you looking at the atom!"
2, 19, Flexo, "So? I look at lots of atoms. Shouldn't you be resting up for your shift?"
2, 19, Fry, "Oh-ho, you'd like it if I went to sleep, wouldn't you?"
2, 19, Flexo, "Whatever it takes to shut your yapper.  Nah, I'm just kidding, you're a joker."
2, 19, Fry, "Yeah, well here's a funny joke"
2, 19, Flexo, "Suit yourself, skinbag."
2, 19, Fry, "That I will."
2, 19, Flexo, "Good."
2, 19, Fry, "Good."
2, 19, Flexo, "Good."
2, 19, Fry, "Good."
2, 19, Flexo, "Good."
2, 19, Fry, "Good.  Good."
2, 19, Fry, "Well, that's eight hours."
2, 19, Flexo, "Yeah, eight hours of solid boredom.  Nah, I'm kidding, you're a wonderful man."
2, 19, Fry, "Finally, the atom is safe."
2, 19, Leela, "What is it?  My God! Did you hear maracas?"
2, 19, Fry, "No."
2, 19, Leela, "Then it wasn't space bandidos.  Bender, lock down the ship. Don't let Flexo escape."
2, 19, Bender, "Aye aye, Captain. It appears that Flexo has outwitted us all. Especially me ... Bender."
2, 19, Leela, "How could Flexo have stolen the atom?"
2, 19, Fry, "He must have used a sleep-ray on me. Sleep-rays exist in the future, right?"
2, 19, Leela, "No."
2, 19, Fry, "Oh. Then I must've fallen asleep."
2, 19, Leela, "Well you were sure right about Flexo being evil."
2, 19, Bender, "I locked down the exits but he may have already gotten away."
2, 19, Leela, "OK, thanks, Bender. Let's fan out and look for him."
2, 19, Bender, "Roger that, I got a map of the ship right here."
2, 19, Leela, "Keep an eye on Fry. We can't rule out the possibility that he did it."
2, 19, Leela, "Aha!"
2, 19, Fry, "Aha!  Uh, searching ... hmm."
2, 19, Leela, "Fry? Why are you looking for Flexo in my underpants drawer?"
2, 19, Fry, "I didn't find him here 10 minutes ago so I thought it was time to check again."
2, 19, Bender, "Well, he wasn't in the, uh, kitchen room."
2, 19, Fry, "Say, Bender, can I hold that map for a second?"
2, 19, Bender, "And leave me high and dry in case of a scavenger hunt? I think not."
2, 19, Fry, "Give it up!"
2, 19, Bender, "Alright, take it. Sheesh!"
2, 19, Leela, "Well, looks like Flexo got away clean."
2, 19, Bender, "It's a darn shame."
2, 19, Leela, "He must have jumped ship with the atom the second we landed."
2, 19, Fry, "Or maybe, he never left at all!  Wait a minute. You're Bender."
2, 19, Bender, "Of course, who said I wasn't?"
2, 19, Fry, "But why were you wearing that scarf and the turtleneck and this fruity number?"
2, 19, Bender, "It's a little thing called ""style"". Look it up sometime."
2, 19, Barker, "Our ninth finalist, Miss Methane Planet, Halatina Smogmeyer.  And our tenth and final finalist, Miss Earth's Moon, The Crushinator."
2, 19, Crushinator, "Thank you, Bob Barker. I'm as happy as a girl can be. End statement."
2, 19, Barker, "Which one of these lovely womanoids will take home the atomic tiara?"
2, 19, Leela, "Downplay the tiara."
2, 19, Barker, "Uh, we'll find out after these subliminal messages."
2, 19, Barker, "So you lost the atom, huh? You're garbage, human garbage! Do you brain-dead space jockeys have any idea how much that thing is worth?"
2, 19, Fry, "100,000?"
2, 19, Leela, "200,000?"
2, 19, Bender, "200,001?"
2, 19, Barker, "You're closest without going over."
2, 19, Fry, "Well, uh, we'll be leaving now. If you'll just sign this form saying you received the atom."
2, 19, Barker, "I'm not signing squat. You find me that damn tiara before the pageant ends."
2, 19, Leela, "But, Mr. Barker--"
2, 19, Barker, "Enough out of you. I may be against the fur industry, but that won't stop me from skinning you alive! As long as no one wears the skin."
2, 19, Leela, "Well, gentlemen, it appears we're boned."
2, 19, Fry, "Flexo!"
2, 19, Leela, "Get him!"
2, 19, Barker, "Next up in what is generously called the ""Talent Competition"", performing a traditional gangsta rap, Miss-- What the--"
2, 19, Bender, "Gotcha!"
2, 19, Women, "Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!"
2, 19, Bender, "Shoot him, he's choking me!"
2, 19, Flexo, "No shoot him, he's choking me!"
2, 19, Leela, "I don't know which one to shoot."
2, 19, Fry, "Flexo! Shoot Flexo!"
2, 19, Amazonian, "Women-only room!"
2, 19, Leela, "Alright, enough of this.  There's the atom!"
2, 19, Bender, "Aw, jeez."
2, 19, Fry, "Bender? You stole the atom?"
2, 19, Bender, "Yeah, but I can explain, it's very valuable."
2, 19, Flexo, "I saw him snatch it while Fry was asleep. That's why I ran to tell Bob Barker."
2, 19, Fry, "Whoa, whoa, wait a second. You mean Bender is the evil Bender? I am shocked. Shocked! Well not that shocked."
2, 19, Leela, "I'm sorry we suspected you, Flexo. It's just, what with the beard and all--"
2, 19, Flexo, "Don't even bother. You people sicken me. I put my life on the line to guard that atom and this is how you repay me? Well you can go rot for all I care.  Nah, I'm just kidding, you guys are alright."
2, 19, Fry, "I'm so confused. The Bender I liked turn out to be evil and the Bender I hated was good. How can I live my life when I can't tell good from evil?"
2, 19, Bender, "Eh, they're both fine choices. Whatever floats your boat."
2, 19, URL, "Is this the guy?"
2, 19, Barker, "Huh? Oh, yeah, that looks like him. Whatever."
2, 19, Flexo, "Wait, but I--"
2, 19, Barker, "Take him away."
2, 19, Barker, "Alright, let's put an end to this pathetic hoedown. Brannigan, read the thing."
2, 19, Zapp, "And the winner is..."
2, 19, Leela, "It figures. Who else but Zapp Brannigan would be judging the most chauvinistic, degrading, dehumanising--"
2, 19, Zapp, "Huh? Leela?"
2, 19, Leela, "Wait, you're making a--  Ooh! Look at that.  I feel like a princess!"
2, 19, Zapp, "Wait. What are you people? Idiots? I'm still going mano a mano with this envelope.  And the winner is"
2, 19, Leela, "I almost had that tiara."
2, 19, Bender, "Me too."
2, 19, Fry, "Well, you guys might both be losers but I just made out with that radiator woman from the radiator planet."
2, 19, Leela, "Fry, that's a radiator."
2, 19, Fry, "Oh.  Is there a burn ward within 10 feet of here?"
2, 20, Lincoln, "Four score and 1145 years ago our forefathers' foreheads conceived a new nation."
2, 20, Washington, "And this Presidents' Day we honoureth those values that my body fought and died for."
2, 20, Malfunctioning Eddie, "Values like this brand new Plymouth V'Ger! Hi, I'm Malfunctioning Eddie and I'm malfunctioning so badly I'm practically giving these cars away!"
2, 20, Amy, "Hey, let's go car shopping! My parents promised if I got all B's they'd buy me a bar, and I got all C's!"
2, 20, Bender, "Mind if I tag along? I gotta bring my ass in for servicing.  The recall notice says it could burst into flames in a low-speed collision."
2, 20, Fry, "No wonder you've been staying at the back of conga lines lately."
2, 20, Leela, "I'll get my coat. Let's go, Bender."
2, 20, Victor, "Hello, I am Victor and I know many things about the art of unloading fine cars on beautiful women."
2, 20, Leela, "Uh-huh. Now tell us she's witty and sophisticated."
2, 20, Victor, "Ah-ah-ah! A gentleman always sells a lady a car first.  This is the Beta Romeo. Yes, the Beta Romeo. Note the cross-your-heart seat belt which protects, lifts and separates."
2, 20, Thundercougarfalconbird salesman, "Spotted her the minute you walked in, didn't you, sir? She's a real beauty."
2, 20, Fry, "Yup, she's beautiful coffee alright."
2, 20, Salesman, "No, the Ford Thundercougarfalconbird!  Nothing makes you feel more like a man than a Thundercougarfalconbird. So how much were you thinking of spending on this Thundercougarfalconbird?"
2, 20, Fry, "Sorry, I'm not here to buy."
2, 20, Salesman, "I understand, and it's wonderful you don't care whether anyone questions your sexual orientation."
2, 20, Fry, "I care! I care plenty! I just don't know how to make them stop!"
2, 20, Salesman, "One word"
2, 20, Victor, "The luxurious seats are stuffed with eagle down and the dashboard inlaid with the beaks of a thousand eagles. Also, there are some eagles under the floorboards."
2, 20, Amy, "That's an awful lot of eagle."
2, 20, Victor, "Yes, and yet--"
2, 20, Amy, "What's wrong?"
2, 20, Victor, "It is just ... the luxury edition has so much more eagle. It saddens me to think of you missing out."
2, 20, Amy, "Oh, don't be sad. My parents are paying and they're incredibly rich."
2, 20, Mechanic, "I installed shock-absorbing bumpers to reduce the risk of catastrophic butt failure."
2, 20, Bender, "You, sir, have defaced a national treasure! I demand you restore my buttocks to their former glory."
2, 20, Mechanic, "Alright. But sooner or later that ass is gonna blow, and when it does, I just pray you're not moonin' someone you care about."
2, 20, Amy, "Smeesh, Leela! This car has everything a beautiful woman like me needs. Victor said so."
2, 20, Victor, "No dog food for Victor tonight."
2, 20, Leela, "OK, the sticker says 55,000, but we'll only go as high as, say--"
2, 20, Amy, "60,000!"
2, 20, Victor, "Oh, I will have to ask my manager."
2, 20, Leela, "Amy, you don't go up from the sticker price."
2, 20, Amy, "I thought it was an auction."
2, 20, Victor, "He is not too happy."
2, 20, Amy, "I'm sorry. 80,000?"
2, 20, Amy, "Uh-oh. I'm terrible at parallel parking."
2, 20, Hermes, "And now you're asking for a day off? Get out of my and my sight!  You're bogarting my patience."
2, 20, Leela, "Hermes, who were you yelling at?"
2, 20, Hermes, "Myself. I asked myself a Valentine's Day off, but I was in no mood for any of my shenanigans."
2, 20, Fry, "Valentine's Day's coming? Oh, crap! I forgot to get a girlfriend again. Well, since neither of us has a date, why don't we...?"
2, 20, Leela, "You just assume I can't get a Valentine's date?"
2, 20, Fry, "Shall we say eight o'clock?"
2, 20, Amy, "Hey, I'm taking my new car out for a spin to Mercury. Anybody wanna come?"
2, 20, Fry, "Yeah, OK. What's the weather like?"
2, 20, Amy, "The usual"
2, 20, Fry, "So, what? Shorts?"
2, 20, Fry, "Boy, this A.C. is incredible!  I'd better turn on the heater too.   Boy, this heater is incredible! I'd better turn up the A.C. some more."
2, 20, Amy, "Hey, how about some icy margaritas?"
2, 20, Fry, "Yeah!  We're slowing down!"
2, 20, Amy, "Don't worry. I'll hit the fuel guzzler!"
2, 20, Fry, "Who wants pop-tarts?  Uh-oh!"
2, 20, Amy, "It's OK, I have an emergency phone."
2, 20, Fry, "What are you doing?"
2, 20, Amy, "Spluh! It's a video-phone.  Lucky I'm a member of the Astro-Afro-Antarctico-Amer-Asian Auto Association.  Hello? Septuple-A?"
2, 20, Fry, "Phew!"
2, 20, Amy, "It'll be a couple hours. Oh, I'm gonna get sweat on my sweat-suit."
2, 20, Fry, "Hey, tell me something"
2, 20, Amy, "I guess 'cause my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike.  As though!"
2, 20, Fry, "I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the Pope?"
2, 20, Amy, "Yeah, and if you were the Pope they'd be all, ""Straighten your Pope hat,"" and, ""Put on your good vestments.""  You know, Fry, it's nice to find someone I can talk to about stuff, and junk."
2, 20, Fry, "Yeah, it's like we feel the same way about junk and stuff, or, whatever."
2, 20, Amy, "So while they're towin' us, you wanna do it?"
2, 20, Fry, "Yeah."
2, 20, Hermes, "Which concludes the summary of the movie I saw last night. Now, any old business?"
2, 20, All, "No."
2, 20, Hermes, "Any new business?"
2, 20, All, "No."
2, 20, Hermes, "Anyone spend the night together?"
2, 20, Amy, "Yep."
2, 20, Fry, "Kind of."
2, 20, Bender, "What?"
2, 20, Hermes, "Oh, my God!"
2, 20, Amy, "We ran out of fuel on Mercury and one thing led to another."
2, 20, Fry, "And it led there again when we got home."
2, 20, Bender, "Congratulations, Fry, you snagged the perfect girlfriend. Amy's rich, she's probably got other characteristics."
2, 20, Leela, "Bender! Romance isn't about money."
2, 20, Bender, "Oh, so it's just coincidence that Zoidberg here is desperately poor and miserably lonely? Puh-lease!"
2, 20, Leela, "For your information, it's because he's hideous."
2, 20, Hermes, "Well I think Amy and Fry go together like a lime and coconut."
2, 20, Farnsworth, "Do I hear wedding bells?"
2, 20, Fry, "What? No!"
2, 20, Farnsworth, "Really? Oh, dear."
2, 20, Zoidberg, "You're both very lucky. I'd pay anything to end my miserable loneliness. If only I weren't so desperately poor."
2, 20, Bender, "Wait. You mean people will pay good money for romance? Hmm. I think I have a scheme so deviously clever that I--"
2, 20, Judge, "$500 and time served."
2, 20, Bender, "Stupid anti-pimping laws!  Well, pay the man!"
2, 20, Hookerbot, "Bender, honey, we love you!"
2, 20, Bender, "Shut up, baby, I know it!"
2, 20, Bender, "Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping but you rarely have to use the phrase ""upside your head""."
2, 20, Leela, "Bender, this is stupid. Why would anyone come to you for romantic help?"
2, 20, Bender, "Hey! Don't make me go upside your head!"
2, 20, Hermes, "Fry! Amy! Put your pants back on! I need a stapler."
2, 20, Zoidberg, "Stop! Stop! If you interrupt the mating dance the male will become enraged and maul us with his fearsome gonad."
2, 20, Fry, "It's working, they think we're making out.  Wait, why aren't we making out?"
2, 20, Amy, "I 'unno."
2, 20, Bender, "OK, Mister...?"
2, 20, Zapp, "Uh, Smith! Zapp Smith. Uh, Brannigan."
2, 20, Bender, "Just check off the things you're looking for in a love partner."
2, 20, Zapp, "Let's see ... Oh, yes!  Yes, definitely.  Oh, I'd like some of that.  Mmm, I'll just have everything on the menu."
2, 20, Bender, "Now to run it through our high-speed romance-a-logical data-fier.  Say hello to Miss Right!"
2, 20, Zapp, "Hello!"
2, 20, Fry, "Wow! We're great kissers!"
2, 20, Amy, "Yeah! Hey, later, you wanna drive out to Europa? We could have a picnic and spit watermelon seeds at Jupiter."
2, 20, Fry, "Hey, yeah! I used to spit at stuff back in the 20th century. Ah, it's cool how we sort of think exactly alike, and junk."
2, 20, Amy, "Yeah. Y'know, Fry, I really like hanging out with you."
2, 20, Fry, "Everything was going great. Then, all of a sudden, she's talking about hanging out. Hanging out? She's getting way too serious. I'm not a one woman man, Leela."
2, 20, Leela, "You'll be back to zero soon enough."
2, 20, Fry, "Don't you get it? She's smothering me."
2, 20, Amy, "Hi."
2, 20, Fry, "You see? You see? Now she's bothering me when I'm at work."
2, 20, Leela, "Fry--"
2, 20, Fry, "I'm doing my job, there's Amy; I spend a few hours selecting a candy from the machine, there's Amy; I wake up the morning after sleeping with Amy, there's Amy!"
2, 20, Leela, "I think you're over reacting."
2, 20, Fry, "Am I?  Am I?  Face it, I'm a prize catch.  I mean, I'm pulling down delivery boy money."
2, 20, Leela, "Fry, she's pulling down billionaire trust-fund money."
2, 20, Fry, "Then she wants me as a trophy husband. Leela, you gotta come to Europa with us. I can't be alone with her."
2, 20, Amy, "So, ready for a secluded picnic with just you and me?"
2, 20, Fry, "Hey, you know who loves secluded picnics with just you and me?  Uh, Dr. Zoidberg."
2, 20, Zoidberg, "Did someone say something about a free hot meal?"
2, 20, Zoidberg, "Mmm, I haven't eaten since Tuesday! Bird eggs, animal slices ...  ... dry woven reeds!  All gone! Can I drive?"
2, 20, Amy, "No. So, Fry, you busy tomorrow? I got two tickets to the big ape fight."
2, 20, Fry, "Jeez, we're already planning to spend Valentine's Day together. Isn't that enough?"
2, 20, Amy, "OK, sure. What do you wanna do for Valentine's Day?"
2, 20, Fry, "Oh, so all of a sudden we're spending Valentine's Day together?"
2, 20, Amy, "But you just said--"
2, 20, Fry, "That's it, Amy, we have to talk. Zoidberg, you drive."
2, 20, Zoidberg, "Wahoo!"
2, 20, Fry, "Pardon me, excuse me."
2, 20, Zoidberg, "Ah, I'll just turn the wheel to maximum fastness!"
2, 20, Fry, "Amy, you know how at first you like chocolate but then you start to get tired of it because it always wants to hang out with you?"
2, 20, Amy, "Huh? You don't like chocolate?"
2, 20, Fry, "Look, could chocolate just let me finish?"
2, 20, Zoidberg, "Vroom, vroom! And the winner of the big car race is ... Hot Rod Zoidberg!"
2, 20, Fry, "Amy, what I'm trying to say is, I think maybe you and I should stop--"
2, 20, Zoidberg, "Uh-oh. Here, you drive!"
2, 20, Zoidberg, "Fry? Are you alright?"
2, 20, Fry, "Ow! My head is killing me. What happened? Was anybody hurt?"
2, 20, Zoidberg, "No, no, no, no, no, of course not. Nobody but you. I'm afraid your body was badly damaged in the crash."
2, 20, Fry, "How badly?"
2, 20, Zoidberg, "That's it over there.  Don't worry, I managed to keep your head alive with some quick surgery."
2, 20, Fry, "Where is it?"
2, 20, Zoidberg, "There."
2, 20, Amy, "Looks like we'll be spending a lot more time together, Fry!"
2, 20, Leela, "This sort of thing always happens with office romances."
2, 20, Zoidberg, "Don't worry, Fry, we'll have your body all fixed up in a few days.  Upsy daisy!"
2, 20, Fry, "Well, Amy, I'll try not to interfere with your life too much."
2, 20, Amy, "Fry!"
2, 20, Fry, "Ooh, sorry. I guess I control that arm."
2, 20, Amy, "So, what was it you wanted to talk about before we crashed anyway?"
2, 20, Fry, "Oh, that.  Maybe we'd better talk in private.  I'll meet you in the closet."
2, 20, Fry, "Amy, I really like you, as a friend. But I think we're spending too much time together."
2, 20, Amy, "You're breaking up with me?"
2, 20, Fry, "I just think we should start seeing other people."
2, 20, Amy, "But, I was really having fun.  If that's how you feel."
2, 20, Fry, "I'm sorry, but it is."
2, 20, Amy, "Well, whatever. Hey, listen, as long as we're not seeing each other, you mind if I ask someone else out for Valentine's Day?"
2, 20, Fry, "Huh?"
2, 20, Amy, "I mean, unless it would make you feel bad, being a third wheel."
2, 20, Fry, "Hey, I can get a date too. Now that I'm single, I'll attract all sorts of women!"
2, 20, Amy, "With my body I think you might only attract one sort of woman."
2, 20, Fry, "Oh!  Oh!"
2, 20, Leela, "So, how's business?"
2, 20, Bender, "Are you familiar with my friend Al Gore? I'm tellin' you, losers get really desperate around Valentine's Day."
2, 20, Leela, "Yeah, it's pathetic alright!  How much?"
2, 20, Bender, "500 bucks."
2, 20, Leela, "Done."
2, 20, Bender, "Zapp Brannigan OK?"
2, 20, Leela, "No!"
2, 20, Bender, "600."
2, 20, Fry, "Oh, hey, Leela, uh, can I talk to you for a minute?  In private?"
2, 20, Amy, "Oh, no problem."
2, 20, Fry, "This is an emergency. Amy made Valentine's plans with some goon and I'm gonna be stuck there, lonely and miserable. Will you be my date, please?"
2, 20, Leela, "You're too late, Fry. I'm sharing Valentine's Day with a very special man. He's not Zapp Brannigan or anything!"
2, 20, Fry, "Then I have no choice but to do something so pitiful and embarrassing that I'm ashamed to tell you about it."
2, 20, Leela, "Bender's in his office."
2, 20, Fry, "Thanks."
2, 20, Bender, "I got your hook-up, Fry. Now, my usual fee's 500 bucks, but seeing as how it's you, I'll need it in advance."
2, 20, Amy, "OK, Fry, we're done putting on the bra."
2, 20, Fry, "Why exactly did you shave your legs anyway? Are you expecting something to happen with your Valentine's date?"
2, 20, Amy, "What business is it of yours?"
2, 20, Fry, "And another thing"
2, 20, Amy, "This is deodorant."
2, 20, Fry, "What does it do?"
2, 20, Amy, "C'mon in, Gary! I'll just be another 20 minutes."
2, 20, Gary, "I'll be waiting."
2, 20, Fry, "20 minutes? You're practically ready now!"
2, 20, Amy, "Yeah, but it's good to make them wait a little."
2, 20, Fry, "Oh, God, it's true!"
2, 20, Gary, "That dress looks great on you."
2, 20, Amy, "Thanks."
2, 20, Fry, "Thanks.  Where is she?"
2, 20, Gary, "I must say, Amy, you're all made up, just like Fry's date. Get it?"
2, 20, Amy, "Mm-mm."
2, 20, Fry, "I've got a date. She'll be along any minute."
2, 20, Bender, "Fry, look who I found! It's Petunia, your dream girl!"
2, 20, Petunia, "How's them eats?"
2, 20, Fry, "Uh--"
2, 20, Petunia, "Don't mind if I do.  Kids'll be hungry."
2, 20, Fry, "She seems a little old for me."
2, 20, Bender, "She is well-travelled. And I don't mean she travels a lot!"
2, 20, Petunia, "Wheels fell off my house."
2, 20, Bender, "Now how about a rose for the lady? Five bucks a pop!"
2, 20, Gary, "I'll take one."
2, 20, Fry, "Oh, yeah? Well I want one too."
2, 20, Bender, "Eight bucks."
2, 20, Fry, "But you just said--"
2, 20, Bender, "Demand suddenly skyrocketed. You all saw it!"
2, 20, Bender, "Leela, meet your future husband Sal."
2, 20, Sal, "Nice eyeball, eyeball."
2, 20, Leela, "Nice ass, ass."
2, 20, Bender, "Ooh, sparks!  Buy her a rose, I guarantee she'll put out!"
2, 20, Sal, "Eh, I'll take my chances."
2, 20, Zapp, "Cheers!"
2, 20, "Woman", "Cheers!"
2, 20, Petunia, "So tell me about your prospects. You a good gambler?"
2, 20, Fry, "Well, ma'am, I--"
2, 20, Petunia, "What's your game? Bingo? Keno? Wait a minute! You don't have your own body."
2, 20, Fry, "No, but I control this arm."
2, 20, Petunia, "Slots player, huh? Sorry, but I think I can do better."
2, 20, Fry, "Wait, come back, uh, darling."
2, 20, Petunia, "Can't, hon', I gotta catch my bus back to Nutley. I'd kiss you goodnight but I lost my teeth pulling out a stump."
2, 20, Sal, "So anyways, Leela, I'd love to take a whack at ya but that 10"
2, 20, Petunia, "Excuse me, did you say ""10"
2, 20, Sal, "Why, yes I dids."
2, 20, Leela, "Bender! Did you just round up our dates at the bus station?"
2, 20, Bender, "Of course not."
2, 20, Sal, "Anybodys else for Nutley?"
2, 20, Zapp, "Baby, wait! You didn't show me your surprise."
2, 20, Gary, "You know what I'd like to do...?"
2, 20, Fry, "Oh, jeez, get a room!"
2, 20, Gary, "Maybe later."
2, 20, Fry, "Hey, I have an idea"
2, 20, Gary, "Actually, I thought Amy might like to come back to my place for coffee."
2, 20, Amy, "I don't really like coffee."
2, 20, Gary, "Neither do I."
2, 20, Amy, "Ooh, I feel a little tipsy!"
2, 20, Gary, "Let me pick up the check."
2, 20, Fry, "Nooo!  That's it I'm gettin' the hell outta here.  Ooh! Ow!"
2, 20, Leela, "Why, if it isn't my favourite head on Amy's body"
2, 20, Fry, "Oh, Leela!"
2, 20, Amy, "We were just on our way out."
2, 20, Leela, "Nonsense, the evening's young. So, Gary, what do you do for a living?"
2, 20, Gary, "I'm a banking industry regulator."
2, 20, Leela, "Really? Y'know, I heard that banking industry regulations are really very simple."
2, 20, Gary, "Oh, no, that's not true. You see, modern banking regulations are a product of five different regulatory traditions. Six if you wanna get technical."
2, 20, Leela, "Oh, I do."
2, 20, Gary, "It all began in 1410 when a number of noblemen convened..."
2, 20, Fry, "Thank you."
2, 20, Zoidberg, "There you are, good as new. Except for your dorsal fin. I'm afraid I couldn't find it after the crash."
2, 20, Fry, "Can I live without it?"
2, 20, Zoidberg, "If you call that living."
2, 20, Farnsworth, "I still don't understand why you wouldn't let me graft a laser cannon onto your chest. To crush those who disobey you.  But I guess we're just two different people."
2, 20, Fry, "So, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And I hope there are no hard feelings about your date, or stuff."
2, 20, Amy, "It's OK, I had fun. And if I ever feel lonely I can just look over at this disfiguring scar and think of you."
2, 20, Fry, "Well, anyway, it's nice to have my own body back."
2, 20, Leela, "So how's the old corpse? Everything hooked up OK?"
2, 20, Fry, "Seems to be. My neck's just a little tender.  Ow! Cool!  Ow! Listen, Leela. Thanks for rescuing me last night."
2, 20, Leela, "Anytime. I actually enjoyed hanging out with you."
2, 20, Bender, "Yep, everything worked out great thanks to good old Bender."
2, 20, Leela, "Come on! It's not like you intentionally set us up with bad dates so we'd spend Valentine's Day together."
2, 20, Bender, "Didn't I, Leela? Didn't I?"
2, 20, Leela, "No! You didn't! You just corralled a bunch of stiffs at the bus station and pocketed our money!"
2, 20, Bender, "True. But in the end, isn't that what Valentine's Day is really all about?"
2, 20, Leela, "Yeah."
2, 20, Fry, "I guess so.  Watch the neck! Watch the neck!"
2, 20, Bender, "My ass! My beautiful ass!"
2, 21, Farnsworth, "Good news, everyone. I've taught the toaster to feel love.  And Hermes returns from his vacation today."
2, 21, Hermes, "Good morning, people."
2, 21, Fry, "Hey, Hermes!"
2, 21, Zoidberg, "Hello!"
2, 21, Leela, "Good to see you."
2, 21, Farnsworth, "Yo!"
2, 21, Bender, "My man!"
2, 21, Amy, "So how was the Spleef Nebula?"
2, 21, Hermes, "The flight had a stopover on the Brain Slug Planet. Hermes liked it so much he decided to stay of his own free will."
2, 21, Fry, "Hermes has all the fun. Wait a second! He's got a Brain Slug on his head!"
2, 21, Leela, "Shh! You're gonna get us all assimilated!"
2, 21, Amy, "Just act normal and switch to a garlic shampoo."
2, 21, Hermes, "On to new business. Today's mission is for all of you to go to the Brain Slug Planet."
2, 21, Zoidberg, "What are we going to do there?"
2, 21, Hermes, "Just walk around not wearing a helmet."
2, 21, Farnsworth, "Sounds great, Hermes! Whatever you say.   Let's ditch him and go to the movies!"
2, 21, Fry, "Hey, yeah!"
2, 21, Zoidberg, "I'm seeing a movie with friends!"
2, 21, Fry, "Cool! Let's see this one!"
2, 21, Leela, "Nah. I'm not in the mood for a historical documentary. I've heard good things about Quizblorg, Quizblorg."
2, 21, Amy, "Guk! I hate subtitles. Alien films are so pretentious."
2, 21, Zoidberg, "Fellows! Fellows! How about a film we can all enjoy? Planet Of The Clams.  It's about an upside-down world where lobster is slave to clam."
2, 21, Bender, "Who invited you? Let's just see All My Circuits"
2, 21, Fry, "Yeah, I wanna see that."
2, 21, Bender, "Good point, Bender."
2, 21, Fry, "I'll take a small Slurm."
2, 21, Refreshment-bot, "For only 25 cents less, you can get a super-small."
2, 21, Fry, "Uh, OK.  Oh, man!"
2, 21, Bender, "Hey, gimme a large diet malt liquor and a popcorn with extra motor oil."
2, 21, Farnsworth, "Down in front!"
2, 21, Announcer, "Glagnar's Human Rinds presents"
2, 21, Fry, "Ooh, this is real futuristic!"
2, 21, Crow T. Robot, "Shh! Don't talk during the movie."
2, 21, Announcer, "This week in the universe"
2, 21, Bender, "Go, Masked Unit!  Uh, hey, buddy! Yo!  You mind taking your head off?"
2, 21, Robot, "I'm sorry, sir, but I need it to watch the movie."
2, 21, Bender, "Just ask Flabby over here to describe it to you later."
2, 21, Robot, "Sir, she is as the factory made her."
2, 21, Bender, "Well they should have stopped making her about halfway through."
2, 21, Fembot, "Whee!"
2, 21, Calculon, "Well, that finishes this paperwork.  Calculon Enterprises."
2, 21, Monique, "Calculon, a fight scene has broken out at the special effects warehouse. Come quickly before a fiery explosion chases someone down a hallway."
2, 21, Calculon, "I have no choice but to--"
2, 21, Mr. Moviefone, "If you want Calculon to race to the laser gun battle in his hover-Ferarri, press 1. If you want Calculon to double-check his paperwork, press 2. Enter now."
2, 21, Mr. Moviefone, "You have pressed 2."
2, 21, Fry, "No, I didn't!"
2, 21, Mr. Moviefone, "I'm almost positive you did."
2, 21, Calculon, "Add in the carryover from form 16A, then deduct line 2B..."
2, 21, Robot, "Pardon me, sir, but you seem to be inadvertently kicking my seat."
2, 21, Bender, """Pardon me, sir, but you seem to be bleh, bleh..."""
2, 21, Robot, "Yes, that's the gist of what I said. Would you mind?"
2, 21, Bender, "Sure thing, pal."
2, 21, Robot, "Uh, sir?"
2, 21, Bender, "Who threw that?"
2, 21, Robot, "That's it! Sir, I challenge you to fisticuffs!"
2, 21, Bender, "Oh, I'm boned."
2, 21, Hattie, "Let's all go to the lobby!"
2, 21, Robot, "I'm gonna open a file of whup-ass on you!"
2, 21, Leela, "Bender, do you know who that was?"
2, 21, Man #1, "Cripes! The Masked Unit! You knocked him out cold."
2, 21, Man #2, "I'm impressed."
2, 21, Doubledeal, "Son, I'm the commissioner of Ultimate Robot Fighting. I'm a connoisseur of jerks like you who pick fights in movie theatres and you're the biggest I've ever seen."
2, 21, Bender, "You should see me at funerals."
2, 21, Doubledeal, "Kid, I want you in the Ultimate Robot Fighting League."
2, 21, Bender, "Ultimate Robot Fighting? Sounds pleasant! I'll do it."
2, 21, Flabby, "My hero!"
2, 21, Farnsworth, "Aw. They don't make movies like this anymore."
2, 21, Bender, "I'm gonna be the greatest Ultimate Robot Fighter ever. Float like a floatbot, sting like an automatic stinging machine!"
2, 21, Amy, "Bender, you can't be an Ultimate Robot Fighter. It's the most brutal form of competition in the galaxy!"
2, 21, Bender, "It is?"
2, 21, Farnsworth, "There are no rules. Two robots enter, one robot leaves. Then later the other robot leaves after being declared the winner."
2, 21, Bender, "Well, that doesn't sound so bad."
2, 21, Farnsworth, "Oh, did I mention the crippling, agonising pain? I'm pretty sure I did. Oh, yes, definitely."
2, 21, Bender, "Crippling pain? That's not covered by my insurance fraud! Count me out."
2, 21, Leela, "No! You've got to do it. I don't care how suicidal it is."
2, 21, Fry, "Hey! How come when I wanna do fun stuff that'll kill me you're against it?"
2, 21, Leela, "This is more important than that marble-eating contest, Fry! It's about pride. Let me tell you a story from my childhood."
2, 21, Zoidberg, "Oh, again with the orphanarium!"
2, 21, Leela, "When I was growing up at the orphanarium, I got picked on a lot."
2, 21, Leela, "My only outlet was Arcturan Kung Fu."
2, 21, Fnog, "Excellent. Bill, Keith, you will go to Junior Championships. Bill, congratulate Keith when he regains consciousness."
2, 21, Leela, "But, Master Fnog, I can beat these dorks with one eye closed."
2, 21, Fnog, "Perhaps. But there is more to winning than beating your opponent. You lack the will of the warrior."
2, 21, Leela, "What do you mean? Watch this!"
2, 21, Bill, "Ow!"
2, 21, Fnog, "No girl has the will of a warrior. You have the will of a housewife or, at best, the schoolmarm."
2, 21, Leela, "That's it. I'll take you on right now."
2, 21, Fnog, "Very well. But, you see, I have the will of the warrior. Therefore, the battle is already over. The winner? Me!  Rematch? You lose again! Had enough? I thought so!"
2, 21, Leela, "I lost my chance to be a champion. I won't let you throw away yours."
2, 21, Bender, "Leela's right! I don't wanna end up a loser like her. Count me back in!"
2, 21, Leela, "Let's see what you got. Touch your toes."
2, 21, Bender, "Still ... can't ... reach!"
2, 21, Bender, "Let's commence preparations for rumbling!"
2, 21, Referee, "Ladies and gentlemen and smizmars, welcome to tonight's main event. In this corner, from Mom's Friendly Robot Factory in America's heartland, Mexico"
2, 21, Fry, "Bender rules!"
2, 21, Hermes, "I got you an official Bender hat."
2, 21, Fry, "Wow! Thanks, Hermes!  I-- Hey! Cut that out!"
2, 21, Bender, "You can't hit what you can't see!"
2, 21, Leela, "Get up, Bender. You can't quit every time you get an axe in the back.  Or a drill through your face. Now quit scratching your axe-hole and get out there."
2, 21, Bender, "Huh?"
2, 21, Referee, "And the winner is ... Bender!"
2, 21, Doubledeal, "Nice work out there, kid."
2, 21, Bender, "Y'know, I think I he might be dead. I took a life!"
2, 21, Clearcutter, "Hi, boss. Yo, dude!"
2, 21, Bender, "Hey, he's not dead. What's up with that?"
2, 21, Doubledeal, "What, you didn't read the pamphlet? Ultimate Robot Fighting's a scam, kid. It's rigged.  It's a secret, so keep it under your head, but the most popular robot always wins."
2, 21, Bender, "You mean I'm not a great fighter? I just won 'cause I'm popular?"
2, 21, Doubledeal, "Bingo!"
2, 21, Bender, "Woo-hoo! I'm popular!"
2, 21, Doubledeal, "In fact, you're more than popular, you're pure lowest common denominator."
2, 21, Bender, "Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!"
2, 21, Referee, "Presenting Bender the Offender!"
2, 21, Bender, "I'm just an ex-con trying to go straight and get my kids back."
2, 21, Referee, "Versus ... Billionairebot!"
2, 21, Referee, "Versus"
2, 21, Foreigner, "I'm not from here! I have my own customs! Look at my crazy passport!"
2, 21, Referee, "Versus ... The Chain Smoker!"
2, 21, Chain Smoker, "I love smoking. And after I win the fight I'm heading straight to your favourite restaurant."
2, 21, Bender, "You know, I'm also an Ultimate Robot Lover."
2, 21, Leela, "Bender! You're three hours late. You can't give up on your training now after both of us worked so hard."
2, 21, Bender, "What do you mean, ""we""?"
2, 21, Leela, "I said ""us""."
2, 21, Bender, "Hey, Bender the Offender doesn't need you. Bender the Offender doesn't need anybody!"
2, 21, Fembot #1, "What about us, Mr. The Offender?"
2, 21, Bender, "Well obviously I need floozies! Let's roll!"
2, 21, Bender, "Howdy, chief. For my next bout, what do you say I fight these two bimbos in some mud?"
2, 21, Doubledeal, "Actually, we've decided to go in a different direction."
2, 21, Bender, "What if I told your we wouldn't be fighting in the conventional sense?"
2, 21, Doubledeal, "Bender, your popularity is slipping."
2, 21, Foreigner, "Sales of your Bender Brand French milk bath soaps are down 20%."
2, 21, Bender, "Those morons! I said pea berry, not sandalwood!"
2, 21, Doubledeal, "Damnit, Bender! If you can't move sandalwood, you don't belong in this league! That's why you're gonna lose next week's title match."
2, 21, Bender, "But the crowd loves me."
2, 21, Doubledeal, "Perhaps. But let's see how they feel about your new persona"
2, 21, Billionairebot, "You'll be the most unpopular robot fighter since Sergeant Faeces Processor."
2, 21, Bender, "Oh, yeah?  Well what if I don't let the new guy win?"
2, 21, Doubledeal, "Then he'll just have to beat you the old-fashioned way"
2, 21, Destructor, "I am Destructor!"
2, 21, Bender, "See you at the fight."
2, 21, Bender, "So then I said, ""See you at the fight."" And that's the story."
2, 21, Fry, "Man, I thought Ultimate Robot Fighting was real, like pro wrestling. But it turns out it's fixed, like boxing."
2, 21, Bender, "It's one thing to win a fixed fight; there's dignity in that. But to lose? And in this atrocity? I can't do it! Leela, you gotta train me to win."
2, 21, Leela, "No way! If you wouldn't take my help when you didn't need it, why should I give it to you now when you do need it?"
2, 21, Farnsworth, "What the hell are you talking about?"
2, 21, Leela, "I don't know. But I'm not helping."
2, 21, Announcer, "You loved him as Bender the Offender! Now get ready to hate him as he threatens your sexuality in his new persona ... The Gender Bender!"
2, 21, Bender, "I'm a real toughie!"
2, 21, Announcer, "Squaring off this Sunday versus Destructor!"
2, 21, Destructor, "I will destroy you!  And stop calling me!"
2, 21, Fnog, "I am Destructor's trainer, Master Fnog. My pupil will be victorious for he has the will of a warrior!"
2, 21, Leela, "Not Fnog! Bender, let's hit the gym. I'm gonna teach you to fight like a girl!"
2, 21, Bender, "I'll put on my tutu!"
2, 21, "Cosell", "Hello and welcome to a remarkable championship bout. Destructor, a robotic armoured tank, whose very use at battle has been ruled a war crime, versus Gender Bender, who wears a pink tutu.  This is Rich Little, imitating Howard Cosell, here at ringside with George Foreman. George, a word in edgewise?"
2, 21, Foreman, "This could be the most one-sided fight since 1973 when Ali faced an 80-foot tall mechanical Joe Frazier. M-My memory's not what it used to be but I think the entire Earth was destroyed."
2, 21, Little, "Interesting, if true. The Vegas odds tonight stand at an unprecedented 1000-0; a bet of $0 on Bender pays $1000 if he wins. Still, very few takers."
2, 21, Foreman, "It's not-not a smart bet."
2, 21, Leela, "According to the script, you're supposed to prance out and tickle him with your fairy wand. Instead, I want you to prance out and kick his head off!"
2, 21, Bender, "Got it. Large kickle, hold the tickle!"
2, 21, Hermes, "Thank God I'm free of that nightmare!"
2, 21, Bender, "Sorry, buddy. Here you go!"
2, 21, Hermes, "Thank you. It was cold down there on the floor."
2, 21, Amy, "Here, Professor, I got you a programme."
2, 21, Farnsworth, "Oh, good. Just let me put on my reading glasses.  Why, Zoidberg, there's a lovely photo of you in here."
2, 21, Referee, "In this corner, the confused young robot with the golden curls. Weighing 525lbs"
2, 21, Zapp, "Boo!"
2, 21, Nixon, "Get that hippie out of the ring!"
2, 21, Referee, "And in these two corners, weighing 400 tons, the gizmo from Pismo ... Beach, Destructor!"
2, 21, Fnog, "So, we meet again. Most amusing"
2, 21, Leela, "Keep laughing, Fnog!  Ready, Bender?"
2, 21, Bender, "I was born ready! Gimme the bell!  Did you hear a noise?  Final boarding call for flight 406, non-stop service to pain.  Now boarding standby passengers--"
2, 21, Foreman, "This seems like as good a time as any time to bring up my new grill for no reason.  With its patented design, the fat drains directly into my mouth."
2, 21, Bender, "Fry! Throw in the towel!  For God's sakes, Fry!"
2, 21, Hermes, "That's exactly what I was thinking."
2, 21, Bender, "Mommy!"
2, 21, Leela, "OK, Fnog, that's enough. Call him off. Fnog?  Hmm."
2, 21, Bender, "Why won't anyone help me?"
2, 21, Leela, "So, once more we meet again."
2, 21, Fnog, "Huh?"
2, 21, Leela, "You didn't train Destructor. You're just controlling him like a puppet. I mean, cheating in a fake fight. That's low!"
2, 21, Fnog, "Better than being a girl. Like you. You're a girl!"
2, 21, Leela, "Oh, right. Girls lack the will of the warrior!"
2, 21, Bender, "Huh? It's bendering time!  Take this. And this!"
2, 21, Fnog, "You were an excellent student.  Too bad I was a lousy teacher!"
2, 21, Bender, "I think you misunderstood the concept of ""bendering time""!"
2, 21, Fnog, "See you in girl hell. I'll be in boy hell -- much nicer!"
2, 21, Leela, "Yes!"
2, 21, Bender, "Yes!  Oh!"
2, 21, Referee, "And the winner is Destructor!"
2, 21, Little, "I've not seen a spectacle of this nature in all my years impersonating a sportscaster."
2, 21, Foreman, "It sure was some fight. Interesting side note"
2, 21, Little, "No argument here."
2, 21, Fry, "Bender? How did the fight go? I heard somebody got flattened!"
2, 21, Amy, "Fry, where's your Brain Slug?"
2, 21, Farnsworth, "Poor little guy starved to death."
2, 21, Leela, "I'm proud of you, Bender. Sure, you lost. You lost bad. But the important thing is I beat up someone who hurt my feelings in high school."
2, 21, Bender, "I'm in tremendous pain here."
2, 21, Doubledeal, "Great job, kid. You lost and you made it look almost half real. I want you to have this card good for 10% off at Bed Bath & Beyond."
2, 21, Bender, "Yes! I'm the greatest! The greatest!"
2, 21, Little, "And so ends the chronicle of one of the greatest ever to play the sport."
2, 21, Foreman, "And he didn't look half bad in the tutu."
2, 21, Little, "That he did surely not."
2, 21, Foreman, "What?"
2, 22, Farnsworth, "Good news, everyone! Several years ago I tried to log on to AOL, and it just went through. Whee! We're online!"
2, 22, Farnsworth, "Go ahead, get into these net suits. I designed and tested them myself."
2, 22, Leela, "They smell like burning Rhesus Monkey."
2, 22, Farnsworth, "Really? I guess when you're around it all day you stop noticing. Off you go."
2, 22, Fry, "Hey!"
2, 22, Bender, "Behold"
2, 22, Fry, "My God! It's full of ads!"
2, 22, Leela, "Follow me!"
2, 22, Fry, "It's immense."
2, 22, Leela, "It's got every piece of information anyone could ever want."
2, 22, Fry, "So I see!"
2, 22, Zoidberg, "What? What's going on here?"
2, 22, Amy, "Hey, that's me!"
2, 22, Bender, "No, it isn't. I just took some pictures of your face and stuck them on someone else's body."
2, 22, Leela, "Hey!"
2, 22, Doorman, "Are you over 18?"
2, 22, Young Boy, "Yes."
2, 22, Younger Boy, "Yes."
2, 22, Bender, "I'm telling you, Fry, they've got a chatroom for everybody. And here it is."
2, 22, Amy, "Ew, that is so gross!"
2, 22, Leela, "Yeah. I'll stick with this one, thank you."
2, 22, Amy, "Yeah."
2, 22, Bender, "Hi, I'm a naughty nurse and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute."
2, 22, Man, "Ooh, you're a dollar naughtier than most."
2, 22, Bender, "So how 'bout them Knicks?"
2, 22, Nerd #1, "Hello? Are there any girls in this room at all?"
2, 22, Nerd #2, "Yeah, bring on the hot chicks 'cause I'm a hot stud."
2, 22, Nerd #3, "Yeah! So are we!"
2, 22, Leela, "I'm a woman, if that's what you mean.  I don't like to play games, so I'll just say I'm a cyclops, I'm a spaceship captain, I'm the only one of my species and I'm interested in meeting a man."
2, 22, Nerd #4, "A woman! I'm scared."
2, 22, Fry, "Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?"
2, 22, Bender, "Is the Space Pope reptilian?"
2, 22, Hermes, "Get ready for fun, Fry. Nowadays, we have a type of game played entirely on video."
2, 22, Leela, "We call it a ""video game""."
2, 22, Fry, "Uh, ""video game"" you say? Well, golly gee, you mighty spacemen of the future will have to show me how it works."
2, 22, Zoidberg, "The doctor is in!  The doctor is out!"
2, 22, Holo-Farnsworth, "Everyone, please sign off. We have a delivery. Plus I have to use the phone--  Leela, please tell the others that--"
2, 22, Leela, "Who are you?"
2, 22, Cyclops, "I saw you in the chat room but you left before I had a chance to talk to you. After all these years of searching for another Cyclops."
2, 22, Leela, "I can't believe it. I've dreamed of this moment all my life."
2, 22, Cyclops, "Do you think perhaps you and I--"
2, 22, Leela, "Fry, you idiot. Ever since I was abandoned on Earth I've been searching for who my people are and where they come from. Then I finally meet another Cyclops and you blast him. You wrecked my one chance to learn who I am!"
2, 22, Fry, "Oh, Leela, I feel terrible. If there's anything I can ever do--  Gotcha!  I won! I'm the greatest!"
2, 22, Leela, "Come on. We have work to do."
2, 22, Fry, "Are you still mad at me for wrecking your once-in-a-lifetime chance to learn the meaning of your existence?"
2, 22, Leela, "No, I'm just happy you were able to win a video game. Now let's concentrate on getting this desperately-needed popcorn to the people of Cineplex 14, OK?"
2, 22, Operator, "Leela, you've got mail!  It's not spam."
2, 22, Leela, "Huh?  It's him!"
2, 22, Cyclops, "To Leela. Subject"
2, 22, Fry, "Kicked your ass!"
2, 22, Alcazar, "Leela, we have much to discuss. Please come join me on the planet of your birth. Co-ordinates follow."
2, 22, Fry, "Well, too bad we gotta make that urgent popcorn delivery."
2, 22, Leela, "It'll get there."
2, 22, Leela, "After a whole life of searching, I may finally have found where I belong."
2, 22, Bender, "Too bad it's a dump."
2, 22, Leela, "Look at that statue. It's only got one eye."
2, 22, Fry, "Lazy sculptor!"
2, 22, Alcazar, "Welcome home, Leela."
2, 22, Leela, "Alcazar?  Are you real? Or am I seeing single?"
2, 22, Alcazar, "Ow! Of course I'm real."
2, 22, Leela, "After all this time, somebody else with one eye who isn't a clumsy carpenter or, uh, a kid with a BB gun."
2, 22, Alcazar, "It's alright, Leela. You'll never be alone again.  Come, let me introduce you to yourself. Do you mind if your servants walk?"
2, 22, Leela, "Not at all!"
2, 22, Alcazar, "We are the last remaining Cyclopses. Our planet is Cyclopia. This is the capital, Cyclops City. Stop me if I'm going too fast for you."
2, 22, Leela, "There's so much information and yet somehow I feel as if I know it all already."
2, 22, Alcazar, "This sacred mosaic depicts our goddess of beauty."
2, 22, Fry, "Hmm, you got any sacred artwork of her from the back?"
2, 22, Alcazar, "Her perfect eye reminds me of yours, Leela. Had our race survived, you would have been a temple priestess or a supermodel."
2, 22, Leela, "Oh, please! Really?"
2, 22, Alcazar, "And there's the infamous pirate, Purple Beard, scourge of the six seas."
2, 22, Fry, "What's over that hill?"
2, 22, Alcazar, "The Forbidden Valley. A holy sanctuary where no one may tread."
2, 22, Fry, "Is that anything like a cemetery 'cause I gotta take a leak.  Ow!"
2, 22, Leela, "Fry, that's offensive to our people.  Isn't it?"
2, 22, Fry, "Ow!"
2, 22, Alcazar, "This is my home. I hope you don't think less of me because I live in a giant castle."
2, 22, Leela, "Oh, no, not at all. If anything, I'm more impressed."
2, 22, Bender, "Ooh! I'm gonna need to make some room."
2, 22, Alcazar, "In here is where I dream my lonely dreams and cook my simple meals."
2, 22, Leela, "It's all so sad. What happened to our people?"
2, 22, Alcazar, "It's too painful to speak of now. Come, I'll show you your quarters."
2, 22, Bender, "Ow! Ow! Ow!"
2, 22, Leela, "I heard you from my room. What's wrong?"
2, 22, Alcazar, "Nothing. It's just-- No, Leela. I don't want to see tears in your perfect eye."
2, 22, Leela, "Please, is it about the fate of our people? Because I'm very interested in that."
2, 22, Alcazar, "Well, OK. But it's chilly and you're going to be all wet from the tears. Let's go into my chamber."
2, 22, Alcazar, "It wasn't long ago. Our people were happy and prosperous ...  ... but the eyeless mole people of Subterra 3 grew jealous of our visual prowess. They fired missile in all directions hoping to hit Cyclopia.  Unfortunately, one of the 40 planets hit, was ours."
2, 22, Cyclopian Man #1, "How far away do you think it is?"
2, 22, Cyclopian Man #2, "A trillion miles?"
2, 22, Alcazar, "Things got hot. You look a little hot, actually. You can take off that jacket.  Our people don't like to be hot. Anyway, just before the impact..."
2, 22, Alcazar, "Our smartest scientists managed to save one baby."
2, 22, Leela, "Alcazar, I used to be a baby, it might have been me!"
2, 22, Alcazar, "Fortunately, I was employed as a pool cleaner at the time and, when I emerged from retrieving a dead possum, I found I was the only one left."
2, 22, Leela, "It's so tragic."
2, 22, Alcazar, "Yes, but the real tragedy is that our race ends with us."
2, 22, Leela, "It doesn't have to."
2, 22, Alcazar, "What do you mean?"
2, 22, Leela, "You're a male and I'm a female."
2, 22, Alcazar, "I'm still not following you."
2, 22, Leela, "Wake up, my king."
2, 22, Alcazar, "Oh, jeez, what a night. Make me some coffee, would you."
2, 22, Leela, "Uh, sure, OK. What do you take with that?"
2, 22, Alcazar, "Pancakes and sausage. Kitchen's in the basement, pans are in the attic."
2, 22, Leela, "Maybe after breakfast we can talk about rebuilding our civilisation."
2, 22, Fry, "Mmm! Great pancakes, Leela."
2, 22, Alcazar, "Yeah, they'll come in handy if I need to cover any tiny manholes.  Listen, hon', we don't want to look like slobs in front of the other species, do we?"
2, 22, Leela, "No."
2, 22, Alcazar, "So get to work on these dishes. And then organise my collection of naked celebrity photos by name and what you can see."
2, 22, Leela, "Look, Alcazar--"
2, 22, Alcazar, "Call me Al."
2, 22, Leela, "Look, Al. I know you've been living alone a long time and I can sympathise, but I'm not your maid."
2, 22, Alcazar, "You're right, I'm sorry. I guess the relationship isn't going to work. So much for the Cyclops race. I thought it was a pretty good race but, uh--"
2, 22, Leela, "OK, OK, I'll do the dishes.  Hey, where'd they go?"
2, 22, Bender, "Ah, Leela's experiencing the greatest joy a woman can feel"
2, 22, Fry, "He may be some low-life jerk but I don't trust him. I think he's hiding something and I'm gonna find out what it is."
2, 22, Fry, "Try and stop me!"
2, 22, Leela, "Al? I did my hair the way you wanted it.  Who are these people?"
2, 22, Alcazar, "Friends."
2, 22, Leela, "Hey, where'd you get this couch and that TV set and all this stuff?"
2, 22, Alcazar, "They were giving it away on the street corner. Just like you, Leela!"
2, 22, Leela, "Too bad they weren't giving away the three things you actually need"
2, 22, Rat Woman, "You go, girl!"
2, 22, Alcazar, "By the way, your pal Fry fell into the dungeon. Take him a taco so he doesn't die and stink up the place."
2, 22, Leela, "Come on, Al, can't you let the little guy out?"
2, 22, Alcazar, "Jeez, Leela, twice in one day? I'm not Superman!"
2, 22, Leela, "Why were you sneaking into my people's forbidden valley?"
2, 22, Fry, "'Cause I think Alcazar's hiding something from you. Listen, Leela, you may not like it, you may not believe it, you may not wanna hear it but Alcazar's a jerk. He's bad for you. He--"
2, 22, Leela, "I know."
2, 22, Fry, "You do?"
2, 22, Leela, "Fry, if it's obvious to you with your learning disability then of course it's obvious to me. He's crude and gross and he treats me like a slave."
2, 22, Fry, "Then dump his one-eyed ass."
2, 22, Leela, "I can't. If I leave Alcazar, that's the end of the Cyclops race. And I won't let that happen. Even if it means a lifetime of unhappiness."
2, 22, Alcazar, "Leela! Mop up in aisle number two!"
2, 22, Leela, "I'll break up with him at dinner."
2, 22, Fry, "I'll be there."
2, 22, Alcazar, "Yo, Leela, what gives? Pig says your slop tastes like crap."
2, 22, Pig, "Yeah. Like crap."
2, 22, Fry, "C'mon, Leela, you deserve better than this guy. Dump him already!"
2, 22, Leela, "I'm trying."
2, 22, Alcazar, "Hey, everyone, jam a sock in your spit faucets.  Not long ago I spent my lonely nights renting slasher flicks with Rat Man and his girlfriend. But then a beautiful woman arrived and-- Stop eating, Pig! And she brought new hope for me and our once great civilisation. Now a million centuries of Cyclops destiny depend on the answer to one question.  Leela, will you marry me?"
2, 22, Fry, "No! No!"
2, 22, Leela, "Yes! I will!"
2, 22, Rat Woman, "They're getting married!"
2, 22, Amy, "Congratulations, Leela!"
2, 22, Zoidberg, "Hello."
2, 22, Hermes, "Oh, this is great!"
2, 22, Leela, "Glad you could make it."
2, 22, Bender, "It's a magical day."
2, 22, Fry, "Welcome!"
2, 22, Fry, "Psst, Leela. You've gotta get me out of here. It's horrible! Eating scraps, letting my waste drop wherever it falls like an animal in the zoo."
2, 22, Leela, "Animals go in the corner."
2, 22, Fry, "The corner! Why didn't I think of that?"
2, 22, Leela, "Look, Fry, I'd like to help you but it's my wedding and I'm kind of busy.  Here. Try to be happy for me. That way at least one of us will be."
2, 22, Fry, "That's it! It's time for this bird to walk."
2, 22, Fry, "Bender, come on. We've gotta get some dirt on Alcazar. Let's go and find out what makes the Forbidden Valley so forbidden."
2, 22, Bender, "Uh, no, thanks. I'm good."
2, 22, Fry, "But there's probably some cool forbidden stuff you can steal."
2, 22, Bender, "I don't know, Fry. For the first time in my life I feel like I've stolen enough."
2, 22, Fry, "Bender, snap out of it!"
2, 22, Bender, "Sorry, I don't know what came over me. Let's go.   I love stealing, I love taking things!"
2, 22, Zoidberg, "That pig over there is wearing the same sandals as me."
2, 22, Fry, "Come on, boy, jump!  Good boy!"
2, 22, Bender, "Whoa, Mittens!"
2, 22, Fry, "My God! Four identical castles!"
2, 22, Bender, "Each more identical than the last!"
2, 22, Fry, "That's weird. It's another Cyclops, only this one has five eyes."
2, 22, Bender, "And here's another one with no eyes."
2, 22, Preacherbot, "Does anyone have a reason why this couple shall not be joined in the irrevocable shackles of holy bliss?"
2, 22, Farnsworth, "Saving a race of one-eyed monsters? Who could object to that?"
2, 22, Alcazar, "Cut to the chase, Preach!"
2, 22, Preacherbot, "Do you, Alcazar ...  ...  take this woman before you ... to love ... in sickness ... do you part?"
2, 22, Alcazar, "Yeah, sure I do. Come on, faster!"
2, 22, Preacherbot, "Do you, Leela, copy and paste his response till death do you part?"
2, 22, Leela, "I ... d--"
2, 22, Amy, "Oh, my God!"
2, 22, Alcazar, "What the--?"
2, 22, Fry, "Hey, Alcazar, you left somebody off the guest list."
2, 22, Five-Eyed Woman, "Alcazar, why you are so late for our wedding? And why you have only one eye?"
2, 22, Alcazar, "It ... ooh, uh!  Hey, sweetie. Just go back to the castle and wait for me.  She-- She's nuts. I can morph into a five-eyed alien and I kinda said I'd marry her. But I'm really a Cyclops and I'm really going to marry you."
2, 22, Fry, "Oh, yeah? Then what about this?"
2, 22, Alcazar, "This is a bit awkward."
2, 22, Five-Eyed Woman, "Who's she?"
2, 22, Leela, "Who's she?"
2, 22, Sandy, "Who are they?"
2, 22, Alcazar, "Go back to the castle, Sandy."
2, 22, Fry, "And maybe you'd like to meet her.  And her."
2, 22, Alcazar, "Leela, this must all be very confusing."
2, 22, Leela, "A little. That's why I've decided to hurt you until you explain it."
2, 22, Sandy, "Show us your real form!"
2, 22, Leela, "Yeah!"
2, 22, Alien #2, "Do it!"
2, 22, Alcazar, "Well, this is the real me. But I can explain"
2, 22, Bender, "He's a saint!"
2, 22, Leela, "But why did you have all five weddings on the same day?"
2, 22, Alcazar, "Hey, lady, you got any idea what it costs to rent a tux that changes shape?"
2, 22, Leela, "Alright, Alcazar, I just have one last question for you."
2, 22, Alcazar, "What's that?"
2, 22, Leela, "If you can change form, why didn't you change it in the one place that counts?"
2, 22, Leela, "Thanks for saving me from that creep, Fry."
2, 22, Fry, "Hey, that's what I do."
2, 22, Leela, "I guess I was so desperate to find out who I really was, I forgot who I really was."
2, 22, Farnsworth, "No harm done. In the many decades you'll work to repay me for that shipment of popcorn you destroyed, you'll have plenty of time to search for your true home."
2, 22, Leela, "Yeah. I mean, how many planets can there be?"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Good news, everyone! The university is bringing me up on disciplinary charges. Wait, that's not good news at all."
2, 23, Leela, "Whatever you did, Professor, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation."
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Yes, but they won't listen. Everyone's always in favour of saving Hitler's brain but when you put it in the body of a great white shark, ooh, suddenly you've gone too far."
2, 23, Vernon, "Professor Farnsworth, do you know why we've called you here today?"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Listen to me, you pompous frauds. If I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me. Dean Vernon, I know the truth"
2, 23, Vernon, "Actually, Professor, we merely called you here to say...  Surprise!"
2, 23, Man #1, "Surprise!"
2, 23, Man #2, "Happy birthday!"
2, 23, Hermes, "Surprise!"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "And you, Coach Smalley, or should I say ""Coach hairpiece""?"
2, 23, Leela, "No, Professor! It's a surprise party for your 150th birthday."
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Hundred and ... what?  Ooh!"
2, 23, Bender, "Good evening, I'm--  Whoa, sorry. I'm Bender and I'll be emceeing this roast. Y'know, they say you can judge a man by the company he keeps. So here's the Professor's oldest friend, a grotesque, stinking lobster."
2, 23, Zoidberg, "Good evening, ladies and germs.  That wasn't a joke, I was talking to Dean Streptococcus.  Now, I'm not saying Professor Farnsworth is old, but if you consider his age, he's likely to die soon.  Hey, Ringo, that was the joke. Oh, it's Showtime at the Apollo all over again."
2, 23, Bender, "Where would the Professor be without students who love and respect him? Right there!  But seriously, of all the former crew members of the Professor's delivery ship, our next speaker is by far the most alive. Captain Musky?"
2, 23, Zoidberg, "I wouldn't wanna follow that guy!"
2, 23, Bender, "And now, a man who needs no introduction.   Fry, get up there!"
2, 23, Fry, "Oh.  Thank you. Y'know, when I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Professor Farnsworth, I thought ""Why should I?"" Then later Leela made the film. But if I had made the film, you could bet there would have been a lot more topless women on motorcycles!  Roll film!"
2, 23, Leela, "Hubert J. Farnsworth was born April 9th 2851 in New New York's nerdiest slum, Hell's Laboratory. A precocious child, young Hubert learned to read while he was still in diapers -- at age 8.  And before long he blossomed into a greasy teenager."
2, 23, Fry, "Dork alert!"
2, 23, Leela, "After 14 years of graduate school, Farnsworth settled into the glamorous life of a scientist"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Listen, you pompous frauds. If I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me."
2, 23, Bender, "How 'bout a few words, Professor?"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Eh, wha?"
2, 23, Bender, "I said ""words""."
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Uh, what a pleasure it is to see my lifetime of accomplishment summed up in a 3-minute film. My best years are behind me. So much left undone. So little time."
2, 23, Bender, "Funny, funny stuff."
2, 23, Farnsworth, "My life is over."
2, 23, Leela, "No, it isn't. You have another 10 years left."
2, 23, Fry, "Leela! He could live another 100 years!"
2, 23, Leela, "No, he couldn't. When you turn 160, robots from the Sunset Squad take you to a mysterious planet and you never return."
2, 23, Fry, "Wow, a whole planet of old people. Where is it?"
2, 23, Bender, "Nobody knows!"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "So many loves half-loved, so many inventions half-invented. That damn time machine alone set me back 15 years."
2, 23, Zoidberg, "If only it'd worked, you could go back and not waste your time on it."
2, 23, Farnsworth, "There's no one to carry on after I'm gone. No one to take care of my work and my research and my fabulous fortune.  By God, that's it! I've got to name a successor."
2, 23, Fry, "A successor?"
2, 23, Zoidberg, "A successor to the Professor?"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "There's no time to lose. I'm off to my lab to build a successor-naming machine!"
2, 23, Fry, "Man, the Professor's been in his lab for days."
2, 23, Bender, "I hope he didn't die. Unless he left a note naming me his successor. Then I hope he did die."
2, 23, Zoidberg, "You? The successor? Over my empty shell! The Professor will pick me. Only I have his lobster-like tenacity."
2, 23, Hermes, "Up yours, Zoidberg. Up wherever your species traditionally crams things. The only sensible way to choose a successor is with a limbo contest."
2, 23, Leela, "What?"
2, 23, Hermes, "Kingston rules. Two men go down, one come up."
2, 23, Leela, "Look, the Professor trusts me with a giant spaceship. He wouldn't trust the rest of you with his dentures."
2, 23, Amy, "Yesh, he would."
2, 23, Fry, "Sorry, everyone, but need I remind you? Blood is thicker than water."
2, 23, Zoidberg, "Blood ... thicker ... water."
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Everyone, I have a very dramatic announcement. So anyone with a weak heart should leave now. Goodbye."
2, 23, Leela, "Uh, Professor?"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Oh, oh, yes, the announcement! As you all know, I am not long for this world."
2, 23, Leela, "Yes, we know."
2, 23, Hermes, "True, mon."
2, 23, Amy, "Buh!"
2, 23, Fry, "One foot in the grave."
2, 23, Farnsworth, "So I've picked my successor. It's someone in whom I have great faith -- even though his mind is undeveloped and he's accomplished nothing.  My closest living relative."
2, 23, Fry, "Oh, yeah!"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "My clone, Cubert Farnsworth."
2, 23, Zoidberg, "He's horrible!"
2, 23, Fry, "Crud. Can I at least be in charge of your dentures?"
2, 23, Amy, "You wish!"
2, 23, Fry, "Where did Cubert come from?"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "12 years ago I began the cloning process by removing some skin cells from one of the shapelier growths on my back."
2, 23, Leela, "Wait. If he's your clone, why doesn't his nose look like yours?"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "I left him in his first tube too long and he got squished up against the side."
2, 23, Bender, "Is he dumb or just ugly?"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Let's find out."
2, 23, Cubert, "What? You've never seen a genius's wiener before?"
2, 23, Zoidberg, "No."
2, 23, Leela, "Never."
2, 23, Fry, "Well, once in the park."
2, 23, Zoidberg, "Mmm!"
2, 23, Cubert, "As long as I'm going to be in charge here, let me examine my so-called ""crew"", if it can so be called. First of all, Dr. Zoidberg, do you even have a medical degree?"
2, 23, Zoidberg, "I lost it ... in a volcano."
2, 23, Cubert, "And why do we need a bending robot around here anyway? What possible use do we have for you?"
2, 23, Bender, "Uh ... me no speaka the English."
2, 23, Cubert, "And why does our space pilot have only one eye? There's someone I'd like you to meet. His name is depth perception!"
2, 23, Leela, "Why, you little--"
2, 23, Cubert, "Wow, that hurt -- the air!"
2, 23, Bender, "Im pending para un bending!"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Oh, Cubert, come in here. I have something amazing to show you."
2, 23, Cubert, "What is it? A competent employee? I doubt that very much!"
2, 23, Fry, "Little twerp."
2, 23, Bender, "Aye, Chihuahua!"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "As my successor, I'm trusting you to carry on my work. These are just some of the half-finished inventions you'll spend your life finishing."
2, 23, Cubert, "I didn't realise you were the inventor of the junk heap."
2, 23, Farnsworth, "That's my prize-winning Smellescope. If a dog craps anywhere in the universe, you can bet I won't be out of the loop.  And this is my universal translator. Unfortunately so far it only translates into an incomprehensible dead language."
2, 23, Cubert, "Hello."
2, 23, Universal Translator, "Bonjour!"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Crazy gibberish!"
2, 23, Cubert, "Don't you have any worthwhile inventions?"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Why, certainly. Step over here."
2, 23, Farnsworth, "These are the dark matter engines I invented. They allow my starship to travel between galaxies in mere hours."
2, 23, Cubert, "That's impossible. You can't go faster than the speed of light."
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Of course not. That's why scientists increased the speed of light in 2208."
2, 23, Cubert, "Also impossible."
2, 23, Farnsworth, "And what makes my engines truly remarkable is the afterburner which delivers 200% fuel efficiency."
2, 23, Cubert, "That's especially impossible."
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Not at all. It's very simple."
2, 23, Cubert, "Then explain it."
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Now that's impossible. It came to me in a dream and I forgot it in another dream."
2, 23, Cubert, "Your explanations are pure weapons-grade bolog-nium. It's all impossible."
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Nothing is impossible. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being is a scientist is all about."
2, 23, Cubert, "No, that's what being a magical elf is all about."
2, 23, Bender, "Oh, my God! Oh, my God! It's Elzar, the TV chef! Oh, kill me now, people!"
2, 23, Elzar, "How we doing here?"
2, 23, Bender, "Oh, Elzar, everything's so good!"
2, 23, Elzar, "What are you, an ass-kissing machine?"
2, 23, Bender, "Yes, sir! Good one, sir!"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Oh, it's a gem of an evening. I feel so wonderful having someone to take over my life's work. And it's all thanks to Cubert."
2, 23, Cubert, "Look, Professor, I may be identical to you in every possible way but that doesn't mean I'm anything like you."
2, 23, Farnsworth, "You ... wha?"
2, 23, Cubert, "I don't wanna be an inventor. I wanna be something useful like a teacher's aide or a prison guard or a science-fiction cartoon writer."
2, 23, Farnsworth, "But-But what about my hopes and my dreams and my wonderful inventions?"
2, 23, Cubert, "In your entire life your only half-decent invention was me and I didn't turn out like you wanted either."
2, 23, Elzar, "You folks still doing alright?"
2, 23, Bender, "Oh, yes, Elzar."
2, 23, Elzar, "Good, 'cause it turns out I forgot to cook that chicken."
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Bad news, everyone. By the time you watch this tape, I'll be gone, leaving behind me nothing but a history of failure and my original hip-bones. You see, I've been lying about my age; I'm not actually 150, I'm 160. Oh, vanity, thy name is Professor Farnsworth. And now that I have nothing to live for, I've alerted the Sunset Squad robots to take me away."
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Goodbye, cruel world.  Goodbye, cruel lamp.  Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin ...  ... and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords, cruel though they may be a--"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "And now that I've nothing to live for, I've alerted the Sunset Squad robots to take me away."
2, 23, Amy, "What?"
2, 23, Hermes, "Oh, no!"
2, 23, Zoidberg, "Oh."
2, 23, Farnsworth, "I know you're all very upset, especially Bender."
2, 23, Bender, "Well, life goes on. Except for you!"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "I'm sure that Bender has just made a cutting remark, but he doesn't know I taped over his soap operas to record this message."
2, 23, Bender, "You bastard!"
2, 23, Fry, "We've gotta get him back."
2, 23, Cubert, "Impossible! No one knows where they take those old geezers."
2, 23, Fry, "Nothing is impossible. You'd know that if you really took after the Professor, like I do."
2, 23, Cubert, "You're his uncle, dummy. He takes after you."
2, 23, Fry, "Uh ... what?"
2, 23, Cubert, "Wait a second. That means I also take after you!"
2, 23, Leela, "Quiet. I think I know how to find the Professor."
2, 23, Bender, "Lay it on us, big boots."
2, 23, Leela, "If the Smellescope can pick up the Professor's odour, we may have a chance to save him."
2, 23, Cubert, "I think not. As you probably already don't know, odours are made up of particles that can't travel through the vacuum of space."
2, 23, Leela, "I'm zeroing in on him.  BENGAY ... mothballs ...  ... letters to the editor. It's the Professor!"
2, 23, Bender, "To the flying machine!"
2, 23, Fry, "To the left!  No, to the up!  U-turn! U-turn!"
2, 23, Cubert, "We'll never find this place. Robots are very good at keeping secrets."
2, 23, Bender, "No, we're not, you little bed-wetter. Oops! I'm sorry."
2, 23, Leela, "There it is! The Near-Death Star!"
2, 23, Leela, "OK, we'll tell them the Professor escaped and we're bringing him back. Fry, you'll have to dress up like a 160-year-old man."
2, 23, Fry, "I'm on it!"
2, 23, Cubert, "My God, the illusion is so perfect I almost forgot I was looking at an idiot!"
2, 23, Leela, "Now, they may ask for a DNA sample."
2, 23, Fry, "I'd like to see them find it!"
2, 23, Cubert, "This plan is impossible. We don't even have a sample of the Professor's DNA."
2, 23, Bender, "I think I know where to get some."
2, 23, Cubert, "Why do I have to be the hump?"
2, 23, Fry, "'Cause you're too ugly to be a wart."
2, 23, Leela, "Your Medicare dollars at work."
2, 23, Barrierbot #1, "Halt! Identify this guest."
2, 23, Leela, "Uh, this is Professor Hubert Farnsworth. He escaped."
2, 23, Barrierbot #1, "Escaped? No one escapes."
2, 23, Barrierbot #2, "This guest does not look 160."
2, 23, Fry, "What? I'm old. Listen"
2, 23, Barrierbot #1, "Hmm, it is true old people are often concerned that there are children on their lawns."
2, 23, Barrierbot #2, "There's no denying that. But we'll still need to verify his identity with a DNA sample."
2, 23, Bender, "Got a hot, steaming batch right here!"
2, 23, Barrierbot #2, "We only needed one cell!"
2, 23, Bender, "Eh, keep the change, buddy."
2, 23, Cubert, "Stupid robot."
2, 23, Barrierbot #1, "Did your hump just say something?"
2, 23, Fry, "Uh ... I-I've got talking hump syndrome."
2, 23, Barrierbot #1, "Ah, T.H.S."
2, 23, Barrierbot #2, "Identity confirmed. Return this shambling shuffle-boarder to his room."
2, 23, Barrierbot #1, "7152 Maple Drive."
2, 23, Leela, "Sounds nice."
2, 23, Barrierbot #1, "Prepare to be surprised."
2, 23, Fry, "So this is where they stick old people. It's horrific!"
2, 23, Leela, "At least it keeps them from driving."
2, 23, Leela, "Brace yourself for the worst."
2, 23, Bender, "And yet he looks so natural."
2, 23, Cubert, "What's happening?"
2, 23, Leela, "He's hooked up to a life-support system.  We have to disconnect him very, very carefully, or the shock could kill him."
2, 23, Guardbot #1, "Freeze!  Seize them!"
2, 23, Guardbot #2, "Seize them!"
2, 23, Guardbot #3, "Seize them!"
2, 23, Guardbot #4, "Seize them!"
2, 23, Guardbot #1, "Get them-- I mean seize them!"
2, 23, Guardbot #2, "Aww, I'm so bad at this!"
2, 23, Guardbot #3, "Uh-oh!"
2, 23, Leela, "We're probably gonna make it, but we might not."
2, 23, Cubert, "It's impossible! We'll never fit."
2, 23, Fry, "Will too!"
2, 23, Cubert, "Told you."
2, 23, Fry, "Come on, Leela! Step your big boot down on the gas pedal."
2, 23, Leela, "They've blown out one of our engines!"
2, 23, Fry, "Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it!"
2, 23, Leela, "Only the Professor knows how to fix it. We have to wake him up."
2, 23, Fry, "Try shocking him."
2, 23, Bender, "Your social security cheque is late! Stuff costs more than it used to! Young people use curse words!"
2, 23, Fry, "Damnit, we'll have to fix the engine ourself."
2, 23, Leela, "We can't, you bastard! No one knows how it works. It's impossible!"
2, 23, Cubert, "Nothing is impossible. I understand how the engines work now. It came to me in a dream.  The engines don't move the ship at all. The ship stays where it is and the engines move the universe around it."
2, 23, Bender, "That's a complete load."
2, 23, Cubert, "Nothing's a complete load. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being a scientist is all about. Right, Professor?  Let's ride!"
2, 23, Cubert, "Good news, everyone! He's made a complete recovery."
2, 23, Amy, "Yeah!"
2, 23, Hermes, "Wow!"
2, 23, Leela, "All right!"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "I'm as spry as a 140-year-old.  See? I only broke one ankle."
2, 23, Fry, "So what were they doing to you in that awful drawer?"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Oh, they had me hooked up to a bizarre virtual world that seemed absolutely real."
2, 23, Amy, "What was it like?"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "It was as though I were living in a facility in Florida with hundreds of other old people. All day long we'd play bingo, eat oatmeal and wait for our children to call."
2, 23, Leela, "It's a hundred times more horrible than anything I could imagine."
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Oh, my, yes. Thank you all for saving me. Especially you, my little clone. No matter what you decide to do with your life, I'm still proud of you."
2, 23, Cubert, "I've already decided. Dad, when I grow up I wanna be just like you."
2, 23, Farnsworth, "Don't worry, son, you will. Incidentally, you might want to read up on a condition known as ""wandering bladder""."
2, 23, Cubert, "Why?"
2, 23, Farnsworth, "No reason. No reason at all."
2, 24, Hermes, "Finally, the last form of the day. Welcome to Stampy Town. Population, five!  And now for the finishing touch.  Ah, the cycle of bureaucracy.  Sweet gorilla of Manila! A letter from the Central Bureaucracy!   Attention, Hermes Conrad"
2, 24, Leela, "I'm having a poker game tonight with some friends from my old cryogenics job. You guys interested?"
2, 24, Bender, "I don't know. I only gamble with chumps."
2, 24, Fry, "I'll play."
2, 24, Bender, "I'm in!"
2, 24, Zoidberg, "Leela, Fry, robot. No matter what it is you're doing tonight, I'm available."
2, 24, Leela, "We're playing poker. But I'm warning you, my friends are serious players."
2, 24, Zoidberg, "Bah, big shots. I say let the dice do the talking."
2, 24, Fry, "Wow! You look happy. Is someone fired?"
2, 24, Hermes, "Better! The Central Bureaucracy is conducting an inspection tomorrow. I will finally be promoted to grade 35, the 35th highest grade there is."
2, 24, Leela, "Hermes, wait! We're having a poker party. Stay and whip off a batch of your famous jerk dip."
2, 24, Hermes, "Sorry, I spent all day putting my office in order. Now I got to go home and relax the traditional Jamaican way"
2, 24, Fry, "Jamaican? I thought you were some kinda outer-space potato man."
2, 24, Leela, "Ah, that must be my old boss."
2, 24, Ipgee, "Hello, Leela. You're fired."
2, 24, Leela, "I know."
2, 24, Ipgee, "I'm sorry but it's just that you're over a year late for work at this point."
2, 24, Terry, "Let the games begin!"
2, 24, Ipgee, "So I told Leela, ""Your request for a date is most flattering but I must decline."" These office romances never work out. After all, that is how I met my horrible wife."
2, 24, Leela, "But you never wore your ring. I didn't know you had a wife."
2, 24, Ipgee, "And my wife doesn't know I have a job. I keep my personal and professional lives separate."
2, 24, Bender, "Come on, let's deal. You'll have plenty of time to talk when you're poor."
2, 24, Fry, "What's with the specs, Bender?"
2, 24, Bender, "They're my lucky shades. I stole them off some lucky guy while his lucky seeing eye dog was taking a whiz."
2, 24, Fry, "Hey!"
2, 24, Zoidberg, "I can't spell anything with these cards."
2, 24, Zoidberg, "Finally, I have a good claw. See?  Three human females, a number and a king giving himself brain surgery."
2, 24, Fry, "It doesn't matter how many human females you have, Bender's on a hot streak."
2, 24, Bender, "Uh, what can I say? Must be my lucky shades!  Nothing, nothing, crap, crap, garbage.  Read 'em and leak salt water!"
2, 24, Fry, "Oh, man!"
2, 24, Terry, "That's my baby's milk money!"
2, 24, Ipgee, "Oh, I am broke. What will I tell my horrible wife?"
2, 24, Bender, "If I were you I'd be more worried about that tapeworm going to town on your intestines."
2, 24, Ipgee, "Let me see those glasses."
2, 24, Bender, "Um ... uh..."
2, 24, Ipgee, "Oh, my various Gods! X-Ray specs!"
2, 24, Bender, "Guys, I swear those are prescription. I need 'em for reading stuff ... on the other side of stuff."
2, 24, Lou, "Cheater!"
2, 24, Ipgee, "Get him!"
2, 24, Terry, "Break his neck!"
2, 24, Zoidberg, "No, don't hurt him! He's my best friend!"
2, 24, Bender, "Hey, you wouldn't hit a guy with X-Ray glasses would you?  Ow! Easy on the arm! Oh! Oh, my ass!"
2, 24, Hermes, "Great cow of Moscow!"
2, 24, Bender, "Uh, it was ghosts! Big ones! And a tornado!"
2, 24, Hermes, "Oh! I'll never pass inspection now. They'll bust me lower than a limbo stick ... at carnival time.   And that's as low as limbo sticks get."
2, 24, Fry, "Aw, hey, c'mon, don't worry. We'll watch you clean up."
2, 24, Hermes, "It's too late. The inspector will be here in exactly one second."
2, 24, Hermes, "Who the hell are you?"
2, 24, Morgan, "Morgan Proctor, bureaucrat grade 19."
2, 24, Hermes, "Hermes Conrad, bureaucrat grade 36."
2, 24, Morgan, "Enough friendly banter. Shall we begin the inspection?"
2, 24, Hermes, "This way, please."
2, 24, Fry, "Jeez, Hermes, you seem awfully calm about this."
2, 24, Hermes, "Don't worry. I have a plan."
2, 24, Hermes, "I'm going to jump!"
2, 24, Amy, "No!"
2, 24, Zoidberg, "No!"
2, 24, Bender, "Do a flip!"
2, 24, Leela, "Don't do it, Hermes! You have so much to live for."
2, 24, Bender, "I get it, reverse psychology."
2, 24, Farnsworth, "Please, old friend, don't jump. Use another method that won't damage your liver. Other people need it, you know."
2, 24, LaBarbara, "Husband! Nooo!"
2, 24, Hermes, "Outta my way, wife! I wasn't cut out to be a bureaucrat anyway. I'm only anal 78.36% of the time. I'm not worthy to stamp a form, so I'll stamp the pavement with my flabby body."
2, 24, Morgan, "Bureaucrat Conrad, if you complete your death transaction without filing a suicide and/or falling accident permit, you will be posthumously demoted."
2, 24, Hermes, "Life. Death. Either way I'm demoted to a tiny cubicle."
2, 24, Hermes, "Sweet something of ... of someplace."
2, 24, Morgan, "As your superior, I hereby relieve you of duty. Consider yourself on paid vacation."
2, 24, Hermes, "Oh! The ultimate penalty!"
2, 24, Zoidberg, "I recommend the health cure on Spa 5, the sauna planet. Here, read."
2, 24, LaBarbara, "Spa 5? Is it good?"
2, 24, Zoidberg, "Oh, it's wonderful! I don't know anything about it but they give me a bucket of krill for every patient I send."
2, 24, Morgan, "Naturally I'll have to assign a bureaucrat to fill in for Hermes while he's away. I assign me, I accept. Welcome aboard."
2, 24, Zoidberg, "Then it's settled. Hermes will relax and Zoidberg will eat. Hurrah!"
2, 24, Morgan, "I've been reviewing your corporate records. Regarding last Monday's delivery, why did it take twice as long as scheduled?"
2, 24, Leela, "Fry got his head stuck in a crater."
2, 24, Fry, "I thought it would fit."
2, 24, Morgan, "And during this period of head-crater interaction, what were you doing?"
2, 24, Bender, "Martini drinking contests with the autopilot. I would've had him this time but we ran out of olives."
2, 24, Leela, "I can explain--"
2, 24, Morgan, "You really think you can explain how you left port without a full compliment of olives? I think not."
2, 24, Leela, "What is this, high school?"
2, 24, Morgan, "Locker check!"
2, 24, Morgan, "Why isn't this jacket in alphabetical order?"
2, 24, Leela, "What?"
2, 24, Morgan, "The zipper. It should be at the bottom."
2, 24, Bender, "Hey, sometimes a guy gets lonely."
2, 24, Morgan, "I-- I've never seen anything like this.  Why is there yoghurt in this cap?"
2, 24, Fry, "Uh, I can explain that. See, it used to be milk and, well, time makes fools of us all."
2, 24, Morgan, "You are all dismissed. Fry, I will speak to you alone."
2, 24, Fry, "Uh, wait, this is the other Fry's locker. I'm ""Phry"" with a P-H."
2, 24, Morgan, "Admit it, Fry"
2, 24, Fry, "What the hell's going on? I thought you were anti-dirty not pro-dirty."
2, 24, Morgan, "I'm surrounded by neat freaks everyday. There's nothing kinkier to me than a filthy slop-jock like you."
2, 24, Fry, "Oh, stop!"
2, 24, Morgan, "Now listen, you filthy pig. No one can know about us. If anyone asks, I'll deny it."
2, 24, Fry, "Just like very other girl I've dated."
2, 24, Woman, "And two and three and four and ...  ... come on, work those arms!"
2, 24, LaBarbara, "This is no spa, it's a forced-labour camp."
2, 24, Hermes, "Curse that Dr. Zoidberg! If I get out of here, he'll be looking down the business-end of a shrimp fork."
2, 24, Australian Man, "Give him one for me too, mate. I don't know why I go to him."
2, 24, Woman, "I don't miss twice, campers!"
2, 24, Morgan, "And for those six and a half reasons, I am demoting Leela to co-pilot."
2, 24, Leela, "Co-pilot? Under who?"
2, 24, Morgan, "The autopilot."
2, 24, Leela, "That drunk?"
2, 24, Morgan, "Mr. Bender, you are now in charge of co-ordinating the Professor's bodily functions."
2, 24, Farnsworth, "That's a full-time job."
2, 24, Morgan, "And Fry, as for you, I am promoting you to executive delivery boy. You will no longer go on deliveries and you will have your own office next to mine."
2, 24, Fry, "Alright!"
2, 24, Morgan, "Mr. Bender, would you high-five him so we can continue this meeting?  And on the rebound?  Meeting adjourned."
2, 24, Amy, "I can't figure why she's so nice to you, Fry."
2, 24, Zoidberg, "She's a hateful monster, this Morgan. She scolded and hit me. I tell you, she's risking my friendship with her."
2, 24, Leela, "Bender, what happened to you?"
2, 24, Bender, "Morgan made me walk the Professor. There we were in the park when suddenly some old lady says I stole her purse. I chucked the Professor at her but she kept coming. So I had to hit her with this purse I found. Ah, the point is, it's Morgan's fault. That pencil-pushing scazwag.  Why, if she were here, I'd-- Uh-oh, is she behind me?"
2, 24, Morgan, "No. I'm in front of you."
2, 24, Fry, "Morgan? It's 3am."
2, 24, Morgan, "I know. A skunk knocked over my garbage and suddenly all I could think of was you.  My God! It's so ... repulsive.  So, uh, this is where you eat?"
2, 24, Fry, "Eat and sleep."
2, 24, Morgan, "Oh, Fry!"
2, 24, Fry, "Uh, wait, Bender's my roommate. He could be back any second."
2, 24, Morgan, "Not likely. I ordered him to flush out the Professor's ear wax."
2, 24, Bender, "Hey, Fry, I made you a candle with--  What the--?  Oh, now I see! Now I get it. Now the pieces are falling into place"
2, 24, Bender, "I must say, this opens my eyes. Another case closed, my dear Watson."
2, 24, Fry, "Morgan, come back! He's stuck in a loop."
2, 24, Bender, "For I was blind but now I see!"
2, 24, Bender, "The cat's out of the bag now!"
2, 24, Morgan, "Mr. Bender, about last night"
2, 24, Bender, "Oh, you didn't understand? Well let me explain. You ...  ... were having sex with you."
2, 24, Morgan, "No. You see, a bureaucrat of my rank isn't supposed to fraternise."
2, 24, Bender, "That's what makes it so juicy. It's the forbidden fruit angle everybody loves. First I'll say ""You'll never guess who saw Fry and Morgan doing it,"" and they'll say ""Who, Bender? Who?"" and I'll say ""It was lovable ...  ... old Bender."""
2, 24, Fry, "Hey, what did you do to him?"
2, 24, Morgan, "I downloaded his brain. Everything that is Bender is right here. His mind, his memories, his in-your-face interface."
2, 24, Bender, "I am Bender. Please insert girder."
2, 24, Fry, "But, but ... Bender need brain ... for ... smart making.  What did you do now? Stop doing things!"
2, 24, Morgan, "I sent the disk to be filed at the Central Bureaucracy. I did what I had to do, Fry; He was a bad robot."
2, 24, Fry, "No, he was a bad friend. I want him back right now."
2, 24, Morgan, "Then you should have filed a request 20 years ago."
2, 24, Fry, "I'm sick of you and your bureaucracy!"
2, 24, Morgan, "Dirty boy! Dirty boy!"
2, 24, Leela, "You and Morgan were having an affair?"
2, 24, Fry, "I couldn't help it. She loved me because of the part of me that's a slob and I loved her because of the part of me that's desperate."
2, 24, Bender, "I am Bender. Please insert girder."
2, 24, Fry, "Poor Bender. Without his brain he's become all quiet and helpful. We've got to go to the Central Bureaucracy and get that disk back!"
2, 24, Amy, "Yeah!"
2, 24, Farnsworth, "Oh, yes, we must, yes."
2, 24, Amy, "Why?"
2, 24, Leela, "Well, those arguments aside, we're still going."
2, 24, Farnsworth, "You can't just waltz into the Central Bureaucracy. It's a tangled web of red tape and regulations. I've never been but a friend of mine went completely mad trying to find the washroom there."
2, 24, Leela, "Then we'll need a guide. Someone who's been there before."
2, 24, Farnsworth, "Oh, I've been there. Lots of times!"
2, 24, Hermes, "Look at that"
2, 24, Australian Man, "Quiet, mate. Pulling the empty carts is the closest thing we get to sleep."
2, 24, Hermes, "But don't you see? They could increase efficiency 4% if they used the empty carts to bring in heavy mining machinery."
2, 24, Man, "Hey, I like the way you think."
2, 24, Australian Man, "Oh, Lord!"
2, 24, Man, "You know, you oughta be a bureaucrat or something."
2, 24, Fry, "Man, how long is this gonna take?"
2, 24, Old Man, "I'm still waiting on my birth certificate."
2, 24, Farnsworth, "Well, it doesn't look like I'll make it inside with the rest of you. Uh, but good luck. Just leave me where I drop."
2, 24, Old Man, "Oh, great! Someone had a baby."
2, 24, Leela, "Come on. I have a better idea."
2, 24, Leela, "Excuse me? We're from the Planet Express delivery company. We're here to deliver a robot."
2, 24, Bender, "I am Bender. Please insert girder."
2, 24, Grade 53 Bureaucrat, "Looks like we've got a new office cut-up!"
2, 24, Grade 41 Bureaucrat, "Look out! Look out! I'm gonna crash my slow-mobile! I had to swerve to avoid you."
2, 24, Leela, "While you're crashing, could you tell us where all these canisters end up?"
2, 24, Grade 41 Bureaucrat, "Oh, you want Central Filing."
2, 24, Leela, "OK."
2, 24, Fry, "OK."
2, 24, Amy, "OK, thanks."
2, 24, Farnsworth, "Wonderful."
2, 24, Grade 41 Bureaucrat, "Nooo!"
2, 24, Grade 20 Bureaucrat, "Central Filing? Of course I know where that is. I'm a grade 20."
2, 24, Leela, "Where is it?"
2, 24, Grade 20 Bureaucrat, "I can't tell you. What do I look like? A grade 16?"
2, 24, Leela, "We're getting nowhere slowly. Here, I'll address this to the Central Filing room.  Then we'll track it using my wrist LoJack-a-mater."
2, 24, Wrist Machine, "Cold. Cold. Warmer. Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot."
2, 24, Grade 11 Bureaucrat, "Please don't tell my supervisor I was sleeping."
2, 24, Leela, "This is it. We'll just run in, grab Bender's disk and run out. Got it?"
2, 24, Fry, "We'll never find that disk will we, Bender?"
2, 24, Bender, "I am Bender. Please insert girder."
2, 24, Fry, "You're right. Nothing is over as long as there's one thin ray of hope."
2, 24, Morgan, "Lost something?  I should have known you'd come here rather than follow proper procedure. And I did know. And that's why I came here."
2, 24, Fry, "Listen, Morgan, we're through. You're an evil, heartless woman and I never wanna see you again. However, would you help us get Bender back for old time's sake?"
2, 24, Morgan, "I'm afraid he's lost in the master in pile, and it would take some sort of giant, mechanical, atomic-powered sorting machine to find him."
2, 24, Hermes, "You rang?"
2, 24, Farnsworth, "Damnit, Hermes, just jump already. Stop hogging that healthy liver."
2, 24, Hermes, "No, I want to live. Organising that forced-labour spa rekindled my lifelong love of bureaucracy."
2, 24, LaBarbara, "My Hermes got that hellhole running so efficiently that all the physical labour is now done by a single Australian man."
2, 24, Leela, "But how did you know we were here?"
2, 24, Hermes, "Dr. Zoidberg brought us."
2, 24, Zoidberg, "It was me! I'm the hero!"
2, 24, Number 1.0, "Request for explanation of incident meeting?"
2, 24, Morgan, "Number 1.0."
2, 24, Hermes, "Number 1.0, I hereby petition you for an emergency sort-and-file, under regulation 2 point--"
2, 24, Number 1.0, "D-D-D-D-Don't quote me regulations. I co-chaired the committee that reviewed the recommendation to revise the colour of the book that regulation's in. We kept it grey."
2, 24, Hermes, "Sir, please, I must located the disk with my friend's brain on it."
2, 24, Number 1.0, "Very well. But your bureaucratic licence will be revoked if you fail to sort the master in pile by closing time"
2, 24, Leela, "That's only four minutes from now."
2, 24, Hermes, "Requisition me a beat. When I was four there was a hurricane in Kingston Town,With a foot and a half of water,Everyone was alright but I cried all night,It blew my alphabet blocks out of order,And they said, ""This boy's born to be a bureaucrat,Born to be all obsessive and snotty,""I made my friends and relations file long applications,To get into my 10th birthday party."
2, 24, LaBarbara, "But something changed when my man turned pro."
2, 24, Hermes, "I was sortin' but I wasn't smilin'."
2, 24, LaBarbara, "He forgot that it's not about badges and ranks."
2, 24, Hermes, "It's supposed to be about the filing! People!We didn't choose to be bureaucrats,No, that's what almighty Jah made us,We treat people like swine,And make 'em stand in line,Even if nobody paid us!"
2, 24, Hermes, "They say the world looks down on the bureaucrats,They say we're anal, compulsive and weird,But when push comes to shove,You gotta do what you love,Even if it's not a good idea.Zoidberg!"
2, 24, Zoidberg, "They said I probably shouldn't be a surgeon."
2, 24, Farnsworth, "They pooh-poohed my electric frankfurter."
2, 24, Leela, "They said I probably shouldn't fly with just one eye."
2, 24, Bender, "I am Bender. Please insert girder."
2, 24, Hermes, "Everybody sing Jamaica!"
2, 24, All, "Jamaica!"
2, 24, Hermes, "Just the bureaucrats, Jamaica!"
2, 24, Bureaucrats, "Jamaica!"
2, 24, Hermes, "The grade 19's!"
2, 24, Morgan, "Jamaica."
2, 24, Hermes, "Sing me home!When push comes to shove,You gotta do what you love,Even if it's not a good idea!"
2, 24, Bender, "I'm Bender, baby! Please insert liquor!"
2, 24, Fry, "Yeah!"
2, 24, Zoidberg, "Congratulations."
2, 24, Number 1.0, "Congratulations indeed but you finished with one second to spare so I'm demoting you. A good bureaucrat never finishes early."
2, 24, Amy, "That's OK, Hermes. At least we have you back."
2, 24, Morgan, "Not yet you don't. I'm still acting bureaucrat of Planet Express. And I have some changes to make. First, Fry, you're fired. Second--"
2, 24, Hermes, "Not so fast! While I was sorting I came upon a certain document filed by one Morgan Proctor. Form B"
2, 24, Fry, "That's right, she fraternised me!"
2, 24, Morgan, "That form isn't about you. It refers to my high school prom date. It was a regulation date that ended in regulation disappointment."
2, 24, Hermes, "Yes, but you only stamped it four times!"
2, 24, Morgan, "No! No! I was young and reckless."
2, 24, Number 1.0, "Bureaucrat Conrad, you are technically correct -- the best kind of correct. I hereby promote you to grade 37.  And as for you.  Guards!   Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!"
2, 24, Farnsworth, "Well, it looks like I'll be needing my heroic bureaucrat back. At severely-reduced pay, of course."
2, 24, LaBarbara, "It's better than nothing."
2, 24, Fry, "What about me? Can I come back at severely-reduced pay?"
2, 24, Hermes, "You got it, mon! In fact, severely-reduced pay all around!  Come on, wife, let's blow this joint!"
2, 24, Zoidberg, "Now it's time for my song!  When I was two, there was a tidal wave in--"
2, 24, Zoidberg, "Aw."
2, 25, Hermes, "Exciting news, people! The pet licence I requisitioned for Nibbler has arrived."
2, 25, Leela, "Hermes, that's sweet. I didn't know you cared about Nibbler."
2, 25, Hermes, "Dream on, woman. I'd like to put the little bastard in a sack and toss the sack in a river and hurl the river into space. But I do like filling out requisitions and these were some doozies!  Great Jah's dreadlocks! There's been a mix-up. This isn't a pet licence, it's a fishing licence. And it's mandatory!"
2, 25, Farnsworth, "Ah! The exact centre of the Atlantic Ocean. This seems the logical place for fish to congregate."
2, 25, Bender, "So we're in international waters?"
2, 25, Farnsworth, "Indeed so."
2, 25, Bender, "Falcon, this is Blue Raven, the goose has nested. Repeat, the goose has nested.  Hey, guess what you're accessories to?"
2, 25, Leela, "The sun, the sea air, good friends."
2, 25, Bender, "Leela's right, fishing blows. Whattya say we make it interesting?"
2, 25, Hermes, "Why not?"
2, 25, Amy, "Yeah."
2, 25, Farnsworth, "Yeah, cool."
2, 25, Bender, "Everybody kick in five bucks.  There, wasn't that interesting?"
2, 25, Leela, "Bender!"
2, 25, Fry, "This contest is as good as over. I once caught a fish this big."
2, 25, Bender, "Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish this big!"
2, 25, Leela, "I'm afraid you're both out of your league, boys, 'cause you're looking at a woman who owns her own harpoon."
2, 25, Bender, "Harpoon, my ass!"
2, 25, Leela, "OK."
2, 25, Hermes, "Let's see now, which bait to use?  Crickets? Squid? Chicken necks?"
2, 25, Zoidberg, "Excuse me, if I might be so bold, I'm willing to offer my services as a bait critic.  These sardines for example are bland and tasteless.  And these dry, stringy night crawlers, though juicy ...  ... very, very juicy--"
2, 25, Hermes, "I don't believe this! It's eating my bait!  Beat it, you mooching crawdad!"
2, 25, Bender, "Hey, Fry, check out my laser-guided fishing rod."
2, 25, Fry, "Quiet, Bender, you're scaring away the fish."
2, 25, Bender, "Fine. I'll head over to the other side.   Good luck fishing on this side!"
2, 25, Fry, "I can hit a fish between the eyes from 20 yards!"
2, 25, Bender, "Oh, yeah? I can hit a shrimp!"
2, 25, Fry, "A shrimp?  I find it a bit hard to believe that--"
2, 25, Leela, "Aha!  Gather round, chumps! I got the winner!"
2, 25, Amy, "Oh, so this is where you shop for your boots?"
2, 25, Bender, "Couple more of those and you'll have yourself a fish stick!"
2, 25, Fry, "Hey, a fish this fine belongs in a fish nugget-style chunklet. And anyway, it's bigger than anything you've caught.  Ow! My small intestine!"
2, 25, Leela, "Bingo! Whatever it is, it's 20 times heavier than a boot."
2, 25, Farnsworth, "You'll never catch anything with that primitive technology. What you need is this fish pheromone.  The most potent aphrodisiac known to fishkind.  Uh-oh!"
2, 25, Zoidberg, "I'm so into you!"
2, 25, Farnsworth, "Oh, my!"
2, 25, Fry, "Hey, Bender, I just caught a fish this big!"
2, 25, Bender, "Quit exaggerating, Fry. Ah, screw this!  If I'm not gonna catch a fish, I might as well not catch a big fish.  There. Like most of life's problems this one can be solved with bending."
2, 25, Farnsworth, "Bender, be careful. That's the ship's diamond filament tether. It's unbreakable."
2, 25, Bender, "Then why do I have to be careful?"
2, 25, Farnsworth, "It belonged to my grandmother."
2, 25, Hermes, "My Manwich!"
2, 25, Leela, "Wake up, everyone! I've got something. And this time it's alive!  Dr. Zoidberg, since when do you even wear boots?"
2, 25, Zoidberg, "I wasn't wearing it.  I was eating it."
2, 25, Leela, "Come on, let's go home."
2, 25, Amy, "Sunburn! My fabulous body! It's ruined! What happened to my parasol?"
2, 25, Bender, "I don't know. It wasn't here when I took your umbrella.  What? I put sunblock on you."
2, 25, Amy, "Well it didn't work!"
2, 25, Leela, "Come on, Bender. Pull in your line and let's go."
2, 25, Bender, "Hey, I'm snagged."
2, 25, Farnsworth, "It's not snagged, the mechano man has caught something!  Sweet Zombie Jesus! It's huge!"
2, 25, Amy, "It's coming up!"
2, 25, Hermes, "Oh, that's big!"
2, 25, Farnsworth, "A colossal-mouth bass!"
2, 25, Fry, "It's diving!"
2, 25, Leela, "It's pulling us under! Everyone into the ship!"
2, 25, Zoidberg, "Wait! I'll save us! By cutting the unbreakable diamond filament!  Well, at least I'll die with my friends. Hello?"
2, 25, Hermes, "My Speedos!"
2, 25, Leela, "Depth at 45 hundred feet, 48 hundred, 50 hundred! 5000 feet!"
2, 25, Farnsworth, "Dear Lord, that's over 150 atmospheres of pressure."
2, 25, Fry, "How many atmospheres can this ship withstand?"
2, 25, Farnsworth, "Well it's a spaceship, so I'd say anywhere between zero and one."
2, 25, Bender, "What's that? Is someone bending girders?"
2, 25, Leela, "We'll be crushed if we don't equalise the pressure."
2, 25, Fry, "How do we do that?"
2, 25, Farnsworth, "That should do it."
2, 25, Amy, "We're all gonna die!"
2, 25, Fry, "Wait, I'll be back in a minute."
2, 25, Leela, "You did it, Fry!"
2, 25, Fry, "Did what?"
2, 25, Bender, "People, it's far, far worse than we thought; my fish got away."
2, 25, Leela, "There. Good as new! Except we're three miles below the surface, we don't have any food and the ship won't work underwater."
2, 25, Bender, "Tempers are wearing thin. Let's just hope some robot doesn't kill everybody."
2, 25, Hermes, "The important thing is that we don't panic. There are rules for situations like this.  Now, the first order of business is lunch. I suggest a nice lobster Zoidberg-- I mean lobster Newburg-- I mean Doctor Zoidberg."
2, 25, Leela, "OK, everyone, calm down. The Professor and I will get to work on the ship. Bender, Zoidberg, since you can survive underwater, you'll go out and look for food."
2, 25, Fry, "I'd better go too. They don't know what I like."
2, 25, Hermes, "Fry, no! The pressure will crush you like a green snake under a sugar cane truck."
2, 25, Farnsworth, "Not necessarily. This is chance for Fry to test out my experimental anti-pressure pill."
2, 25, Fry, "I can't swallow that."
2, 25, Farnsworth, "Well then good news! It's a suppository."
2, 25, Zoidberg, "How are you doing there, Fry?  Glad to hear it.  Aha!"
2, 25, Bender, "Aw, yeah!"
2, 25, Zoidberg, "Yum, yum, yum!  Uh-oh!  Look at me, I'm Dr. Zoidberg, homeowner!"
2, 25, Zoidberg, "Careful, Fry, I think that flag might be poisonous."
2, 25, Bender, "Ahoy, mateys! I shanghaied us some hearty grog.  Arr! The laws o' science be a harsh mistress!"
2, 25, Zoidberg, "Say, robot, old buddy? Could you help me move a couch?"
2, 25, Bender, "Uh, OK, but I'm not carrying it upstairs."
2, 25, Zoidberg, "What is it, Fry?"
2, 25, Fry, "I think I saw a mermaid."
2, 25, Bender, "You want some lemonade? You saw a big parade?"
2, 25, Zoidberg, "Your student loans have been repaid? Then how 'bout lending your old pal Zoidberg a few bucks, Mr. Millionaire!"
2, 25, Leela, "Fry, swallow your food. Then talk."
2, 25, Fry, "A mermaid!"
2, 25, Amy, "You think you saw a mermaid?"
2, 25, Fry, "No, I did see a mermaid! She was wearing a tube top and she had a beautiful scaly tail. And I think she had hair extensions."
2, 25, Bender, "Yeah, right!"
2, 25, Leela, "Sure she did."
2, 25, Hermes, "OK, Fry!"
2, 25, Farnsworth, "You're simply hallucinating, you ... moron."
2, 25, Fry, "What's so far-fetched about mermaids? I mean, there's all sorts of weird sea creatures here in the future. Like Dr. Zoidberg."
2, 25, Leela, "I'm afraid Fry is suffering from ocean madness."
2, 25, Fry, "Every time something good happens to me you say it's some kind of madness, or I'm drunk, or I ate too much candy. Well I saw a real mermaid and I wish for once my friends would have decency and kindness to believe me."
2, 25, Leela, "Ocean madness."
2, 25, Farnsworth, "He may have ocean madness but that's no excuse for ocean rudeness."
2, 25, Fry, "Ocean madness. Yeah, right. It's always something, ain't it?   It's her! Bender, wake up! She's here! Wake up!  Oh! oxygen!"
2, 25, Mermaid, "Here you go, darlin'."
2, 25, Fry, "Hey! I can breath and talk, just like a fish!"
2, 25, Mermaid, "Oh, you speak fish?"
2, 25, Fry, "What?"
2, 25, Mermaid, "I'm sorry, my accent's atrocious. Hi, my name's Umbriel!"
2, 25, Fry, "I'm Fry. So, uh, am I gonna drown?"
2, 25, Umbriel, "Course not. Just stay calm and let the currents relax your every muscle."
2, 25, Fry, "Aw, yeah!"
2, 25, Umbriel, "Did it just get warmer?"
2, 25, Fry, "I can't believe you're really real. I like your tail."
2, 25, Umbriel, "Oh, you're sweet. I like those wiggly doo-dads comin' outta your hips."
2, 25, Fry, "Oh, thanks. They're called pants."
2, 25, Umbriel, "This here's a volcanic vent. The water comes out at over 4000 degrees."
2, 25, Fry, "No kidding."
2, 25, Umbriel, "Did it just get colder?  Tell me more about that bizarre land-y world you come from. Is there water there too?"
2, 25, Fry, "Sure. Sometimes it falls from the sky."
2, 25, Umbriel, "Hm."
2, 25, Fry, "And sometimes it doesn't."
2, 25, Umbriel, "Oh, Mr. Fry! You do go on!"
2, 25, Fry, "You know what I like best about you, Umbriel? You find me fascinating even when I'm not claiming to be a jewel thief or a lion tamer."
2, 25, Umbriel, "Lions? There are sealions on the land?"
2, 25, Fry, "Yup. We call them land-sealions ... I tame them!"
2, 25, Farnsworth, "I'm almost finish reconfiguring the ships propulsion system. We can leave as soon as the paper-m√¢ch√© is dry."
2, 25, Leela, "Where's Fry?"
2, 25, Bender, "I didn't kill him. Professor?"
2, 25, Farnsworth, "No, I've been busy."
2, 25, Hermes, "He must've gone out looking for that mermaid. The poor, demented honky."
2, 25, Leela, "It's ocean madness alright. Sailors call it aqua dementia, the deep-down crazies, the wet willies, the screaming moist!"
2, 25, Farnsworth, "We'll form a search party. Now, we'll need oxygen."
2, 25, Bender, "I got it covered.  In the event of an emergency, my ass can be used as a floatation device."
2, 25, Farnsworth, "Ooh, that reminds me"
2, 25, Amy, "Yes! Stop asking!"
2, 25, Zoidberg, "I've got his scent! Over here where the water gets warmer. This way!"
2, 25, Bender, "Bend me!"
2, 25, Amy, "Dude! An ancient sunken city!"
2, 25, Farnsworth, "Could it possibly be? Are the old legends true?  It is! It's the fabled lost city of Atlanta!"
2, 25, Merman, "Howdy, y'all!"
2, 25, Colonel, "Welcome to Atlanta. Folks round these parts call me the Colonel.  Here, have some breathers, courtesy of our Chamber of Commerce."
2, 25, Farnsworth, "This is uncomfortable and humiliating. Now, if they could put it in the form of a suppository."
2, 25, Colonel, "Y'all enjoy your stay! Tourism's our main source of income round here so see the sights, spend some money. Please don't leave!"
2, 25, Bender, "Fry! Oh, I just knew you were still alive!  I owe you 10 bucks, Hermes!"
2, 25, Fry, "Hey, you guys, the most amazing thing happened. It's two-for-one Tuesday at Krispy Kreme! Plus there's mermaids."
2, 25, Colonel, "Nice out of town folks, I'd like you to meet my daughter, Umbriel. Umbriel, these are some Yankees."
2, 25, Amy, "So, Fry, Atlanta was an American city in your time?"
2, 25, Fry, "I think it was just an airport. They had a place where you could buy nuts."
2, 25, Umbriel, "No! Ancient Atlanta was more than just a Delta hub. It was a vibrant metropolis, the equal of Paris or New York."
2, 25, Fry, "That's right, honey! Whatever you say."
2, 25, Umbriel, "Look at these fabulous ruins. Turner Field, the Coca-Cola bottling plant, the, uh, the airport."
2, 25, Leela, "But tell us, how could a city with such a ... fabulous airport end up underwater?"
2, 25, Colonel, "Ah, now that's a story that can only rightly be told in a Chamber of Commerce video narrated by folk-rock troubadour Donovan."
2, 25, Donovan, "Atlanta was a city, landlocked,Hundreds of miles from the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean,Yet so desperate the city's desire for tourism,That they moved offshore, becoming an island,And an even bigger Delta hub,"
2, 25, Donovan, "until the city overdevelopedAnd it started to sink.Knowing their fate, the quality people ran away,Ted Turner, Hank Aaron, Jeff Foxworthy,The Guy Who Invented Coca-Cola, the Magician,And the other so-called gods of our legends,Though gods they were--And also, Jane Fonda was there."
2, 25, Donovan, "The others chose to remain behindOn their porches with their rifles,And one day evolve into mermaids,And sing and dance,And ring in the new."
2, 25, Mermaids, "Hail Atlanta!"
2, 25, Leela, "The magician?"
2, 25, Bender, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wouldn't it take millions of years to evolve into mermaids?"
2, 25, Umbriel, "Normally, yes, but the caffeine really sped things up.  That stuff's wonderful."
2, 25, Colonel, "So when Umbriel first brought home this carpet bagger, I was again' it. But, damnit, if Old Legs here ain't grown on me!"
2, 25, Fry, "Aw, shucks, Colonel."
2, 25, Hermes, "Well, it's all very nice here but we should be going. I miss me wife and me oxygen."
2, 25, Farnsworth, "Yes, we all miss our loved ones and gases. Come on, Fry."
2, 25, Fry, "Wait. I'm not going with you."
2, 25, Leela, "But, Fry, what about us? What about your life on the surface? You don't belong down here."
2, 25, Zoidberg, "She's right, I mean, sure, they got the Braves but it's a third-rate symphony."
2, 25, Farnsworth, "Fry, you half-mad, half-insane maniac, be reasonable. Don't you realise that if you stay at this depth your body will permanently adapt to the pressure?"
2, 25, Fry, "Realise it? I don't even understand it!"
2, 25, Farnsworth, "It means you'll never be able to return to the surface."
2, 25, Fry, "I don't care. I'm staying. I've got everything I want right here."
2, 25, Farnsworth, "I'm bored! Let's go!"
2, 25, Zoidberg, "You know, Fry, I've got a little place just outside town. You could come visit, maybe?"
2, 25, Fry, "Sorry, Zoidberg. I'm trying to join the country club."
2, 25, Bender, "Oh, Fry!  I'll miss you!"
2, 25, Colonel, "Y'all come back now, y'hear?"
2, 25, Farnsworth, "Let's go, damnit! Let's go!"
2, 25, Zoidberg, "Well, I guess this is goodbye for me as well."
2, 25, Leela, "Whatever."
2, 25, Amy, "Later."
2, 25, Farnsworth, "Bye."
2, 25, Zoidberg, "No! My home! It burned down!   How did this happen?"
2, 25, Hermes, "That's a very good question."
2, 25, Bender, "So that's where I left my cigar."
2, 25, Hermes, "That just raises further questions!"
2, 25, Fry, "You know, Umbriel, these last 24 hours have been the happiest days of my life."
2, 25, Umbriel, "Oh, Fry! I want you to make a mer-woman outta mer-me."
2, 25, Fry, "Mercy! I do believe I'm gettin' the vapours!"
2, 25, Umbriel, "What the hell is that?"
2, 25, Fry, "Yeah I'm a little confused too. How do I ... y'know ... with the tail and all?"
2, 25, Umbriel, "I'm not your first am I? I mean, I-I lay my eggs and leave and you release your fertiliser."
2, 25, Fry, "Why couldn't she be the other type of mermaid, with the fish part on top and the lady part on the bottom?"
2, 25, Umbriel, "Now who's gonna escort me to the Debutante Ball?"
2, 25, Colonel, "Well what about that rich, young dugong from Macon?"
2, 25, Farnsworth, "There! The engine modifications are complete."
2, 25, Leela, "Prepare for launch."
2, 25, Fry, "Wait! Wait for me! Don't leave me here!"
2, 25, Poopenmeyer, "And so, in honour of his record-breaking catch, I'm proud to award Bender this cheque for $1000."
2, 25, Leela, "It's you!"
2, 25, Bender, "Hey, buddy!"
2, 25, Hermes, "My Manwich!"
2, 25, Leela, "Fry, are you alright? What happened?"
2, 25, Amy, "What about Umbriel?"
2, 25, Fry, "Well, it turns out I loved her, but I wasn't in love with her."
2, 25, Amy, "Trouble in bed."
2, 25, Bender, "Ah, it's great to have you back, buddy."
2, 25, Poopenmeyer, "Wait a-- This is no record! Gimme back that cheque! I'm giving it to some giant orphans."
2, 25, Fry, "Ow! Bender, you're hurting me. Ow!"
2, 25, Zoidberg, "Hey! I'm trying to sleep in here!"
2, 25, Donovan, "Hail Atlanta!"
2, 26, Bender, "Wow! I'm finally gonna see my favourite chef, TV's Elzar. Oh this is the greatest nanosecond of my life. No, this one is-- No, this one. Wait ... that one was slightly worse. Ah, so far, so good on this one."
2, 26, Announcer, "And now, here he is"
2, 26, Bender, "Yeah!  Alright! Yeah, yeah, baby!"
2, 26, Man, "Elzar!  Alright!"
2, 26, Bender, "Elzar, you're my God. Please sign this sketch I drew of you.   Oh, Elzar! Bless you!"
2, 26, Elzar, "Now this is why I prefer your non-stick robots."
2, 26, Bender, "Oh.   Alright, yeah!   Alright, yeah!"
2, 26, Elzar, "Hey, I hope you folks like Cajun food.  'Cause today we're making Elzar's down-home Neptune-style gumbo. Now, step one. You wanna boil some oysters in a pot of down-home Neptune-style gumbo."
2, 26, Bender, "Boiled? Interesting."
2, 26, Leela, "Bender, please try to be a little quieter."
2, 26, Bender, "No, you shut up."
2, 26, Elzar, "Of course, every now and then you'll wanna knock it up a notch with a blast from your spice weasel.  Bam!"
2, 26, Bender, "Oh, yeah! Bam it again, Elzar! Knock it up another notch!"
2, 26, Elzar, "Jeez, who let this guy through the metal detector?"
2, 26, Bender, "Come on, you wimp! Work that weasel! Quit holding out on us."
2, 26, Elzar, "If you promise to stop interrupting, alright. Against my will, I'm gonna knock it up another notch."
2, 26, Bender, "I gotta get this notch-up-knocking on film.  Hey, Elzar, think fast."
2, 26, Elzar, "What, huh?"
2, 26, Leela, "Ow! My eye! I'm blind!"
2, 26, Bender, "Bam!"
2, 26, Hattie, "Tell me, doctor, how's my cyst?"
2, 26, Taco Bellevue Doctor, "Grande."
2, 26, Zoidberg, "I don't like the looks of this doctor. I bet I've lost more patients than he's even treated."
2, 26, Doctor #2, "OK. What does this look like to you?"
2, 26, Leela, "Um ... a grey-ish blob?"
2, 26, Doctor #2, "Right.  And this one?"
2, 26, Leela, "Um ... a grey-ish blob?"
2, 26, Doctor #2, "Not as right that time. It looks like you might have some mild corneal irritation."
2, 26, Zoidberg, "Nice try, little boy. You may have your textbook knowledge and your real diploma but I have more skill in my little claw than you have in your whole carapace!"
2, 26, Doctor #2, "You seem a bit tense.  Here, try these."
2, 26, Zoidberg, "Sure, butter me up with candy. But it won't work, sonny!   Why always the fighting?"
2, 26, Doctor #2, "Your eye just needs some rest. You'll have to wear this patch for about a week."
2, 26, Leela, "A week? What do you think, Dr. Zoidberg?"
2, 26, Zoidberg, "Clack."
2, 26, Zoidberg, "Thanks for the help, Leela."
2, 26, Amy, "Leela, we're right here."
2, 26, Leela, "I'm not deaf. I just have to wear this stupid eye patch. Does it look stupid?"
2, 26, Fry, "No! In fact, it looks so nice I think I might get one too."
2, 26, Bender, "It's Elzar again! Oh, my God, I'm so excited, I wish I could wet my pants!"
2, 26, Elzar, "Leela, please, let me make this up to you. You and your friends are all invited to my restaurant tonight. I'm gonna bam you up a dinner you'll never forget."
2, 26, Amy, "Alright!"
2, 26, Fry, "Yeah!"
2, 26, Bender, "Hooray for blind-y!"
2, 26, Zoidberg, "Oh, God! I'm coming down!"
2, 26, Elzar, "Folks, tell the neighbours to watch your mouth 'cause your taste buds are going on vacation. I made you each your own special meal, so dig in!"
2, 26, Hermes, "It's the biggest Jamaican platter I've ever seen. Jerk chicken, jerk beef, jerk pork. Is there any meat this man can't jerk?"
2, 26, Zoidberg, "The king crab is to die for. Look! A tiny edible crown."
2, 26, Amy, "What's it made of?"
2, 26, Zoidberg, "Wood!"
2, 26, Bender, "Oh, Fry, you gotta try this sterno-nicoise!"
2, 26, Fry, "No, thanks. That's robot food."
2, 26, Bender, "It's so good. Oh, just try a little!"
2, 26, Fry, "No, really, I don't--  Mmm!"
2, 26, Amy, "Are you doing alright over there, Leela?"
2, 26, Leela, "Oh, yeah, this salad's fantastic.  So fresh."
2, 26, Farnsworth, "Oh, my. That steamed carrot was a bit spicy for me."
2, 26, Elzar, "Everybody enjoy their dinner?"
2, 26, Leela, "Are you kidding me?"
2, 26, Amy, "Uh-huh."
2, 26, Bender, "God, yes, Elzar."
2, 26, Elzar, "Well, I enjoyed cooking for you. And to make everything completely square, I want you to have these complimentary after-dinner chocolates."
2, 26, Hermes, "What's this under the chocolates?"
2, 26, Elzar, "Yeah, you take care of that whenever you want."
2, 26, Hermes, "Hey."
2, 26, Amy, "A bill?"
2, 26, Leela, "You're charging us? After you blinded me?"
2, 26, Elzar, "Hey, I made you a nice meal. This ain't a charity."
2, 26, Fry, "$1200?"
2, 26, Farnsworth, "Holy Zombie Jesus!"
2, 26, Hermes, "We don't have that kind of money. Especially not Zoidberg."
2, 26, Zoidberg, "They took away my credit card."
2, 26, Elzar, "OK, OK, wait. I know how to take care of this, no problem."
2, 26, URL, "You deadbeats are under arrest. It's a stone cold shame."
2, 26, Smitty, "He's making a break for it. Get him!"
2, 26, Fry, "No! No! I was just picking my nose."
2, 26, Smitty, "He's picking his nose. Get him!"
2, 26, Smitty, "The old dine-and-dash, huh? My daddy owned a restaurant and it's punks like you who kept it from going regional. That's why I became a cop."
2, 26, URL, "Now it's payback time. Aw, yeah!"
2, 26, Zoidberg, "Please don't hit me. I'm brittle!"
2, 26, Bender, "Hey, wait a second. I've got the perfect solution."
2, 26, Zoidberg, "Listen to the smart robot."
2, 26, Bender, "I love cooking and Elzar's ass loves getting kissed, right?"
2, 26, Elzar, "No question."
2, 26, Bender, "So, how 'bout I work part-time at the restaurant to pay off our debt?"
2, 26, Elzar, "I don't know. I usually hire people who are a little less unbearable."
2, 26, Hermes, "Oh, Bender's a model employee."
2, 26, Amy, "He's so polite."
2, 26, Leela, "And hard-working."
2, 26, Fry, "He's made of candy."
2, 26, Elzar, "OK, fine, I'll give it a shot."
2, 26, Fry, "Alright!"
2, 26, Hermes, "Yes!"
2, 26, Bender, "Hot diggety!"
2, 26, Smitty, "You'd better keep your nose clean."
2, 26, Bender, "That'll be easy. I never wear the damn thing."
2, 26, Hermes, "Ah! Time for my precious 10am meeting.  Where in Legoland is Leela?"
2, 26, Leela, "I'm here and I'm getting along just fine, thank you. My walk to work today just took a little longer than usual. Nibbler took me through the zoo for some reason."
2, 26, Amy, "Leela, a little help is nothing to be embarrassed about. Like, maybe I could do your makeup."
2, 26, Leela, "I don't need help. For your information I did this all by myself."
2, 26, Farnsworth, "You look beautiful. Incidentally, my favourite artist is Picasso."
2, 26, Bender, "Well, I'm off to work at the restaurant. One of you will have to fill in for me while I'm gone."
2, 26, Farnsworth, "Better yet, I'll build someone to fill in for you.  Some kind of gamma-powered mechanical monster, with freeway on-ramps for arms and a heart as black as coal..."
2, 26, Bender, "Well, if that new guy can't handle things, gimme a call."
2, 26, Bender, "I'm done siphoning out the grease trap. I think I need a mint.  So, uh, what job do I move up to? Pastry chef? Saucier? Soup guy?"
2, 26, Elzar, "Bam!"
2, 26, Bender, "Bam yourself!   Hey, who are they?"
2, 26, Elzar, "Let's just say they're very good customers and I'm not answering anymore questions."
2, 26, Bender, "Are they the Robot Mafia?"
2, 26, Elzar, "Yes."
2, 26, Donbot, "You call this a table? You call this a table? I wouldn't hit a guy over the head with this table."
2, 26, Clamps, "You hear that? The Donbot don't like it. I oughta clamp you. You wanna be clamped?"
2, 26, Joey, "Whoa! Whoa! Calm down, Clamps.  The boss, he likes a wall up which his back can be put against. Such as like this there."
2, 26, Waitress, "But that table's already--"
2, 26, Bender, "Ah, let me bus that for you, gentlemen.  No, what I meant to do was--"
2, 26, Woman, "Oh!"
2, 26, Man, "I can't believe this!"
2, 26, Bender, "Mind your own business and get out!"
2, 26, Donbot, "Huh. I like this guy's lack of style."
2, 26, Clamps, "So I finally get this guy a pair of cement shoes which he likes 'cause they're lighter than his lead ones."
2, 26, Donbot, "Hey! You think this computes over here? Where's all my change? I gave you a hundred."
2, 26, Bender, "No, you gave me a fifty."
2, 26, Donbot, "Oh, no I didn't."
2, 26, Bender, "Yeah, you did."
2, 26, Clamps, "Hey, you tryin' to steal from the Donbot?"
2, 26, Bender, "I'm tryin' but he's not makin' it easy."
2, 26, Donbot, "Get a load of the ball bearings on this guy, huh. I like you, kid. Here's something for your trouble.   It's money."
2, 26, Bender, "Wow! Thanks."
2, 26, Donbot, "Hey, you earned that 50 bucks."
2, 26, Bender, "You gave me a twenty."
2, 26, Donbot, "I did?  Oh, I'm sorry, I meant to-- Hey, wait a minute.  I got a good feeling about you. Say, you wanna work for me as a hired goon?"
2, 26, Bender, "Are you kidding? I've always wanted to break into gooning!   Hey, Elzar! I quit!"
2, 26, Elzar, "K."
2, 26, Donbot, "We're gonna try you out with a little delivery job. It's for a, uh, private lottery that we run."
2, 26, Bender, "Wow, you guys run numbers?"
2, 26, Clamps, "Well, nothing fancy, y'know. Ones and zeros mostly."
2, 26, Donbot, "Just take this disk over to the pool hall and give it to Sammy ""The Mechanical Bull"" Gravano. And watch out for the cops."
2, 26, Bender, "That's just what my mom used to tell me."
2, 26, Bender, "That's some fine oil-ade, son. We could use a man like you in the Robot Mafia, which I'm sorta in."
2, 26, Tinny Tim, "You flatter me, kind goon. But I'm only programmed to sell oil-ade and write in cute backwards letters like on the sign here."
2, 26, Bender, "Aw, crap! The cops!"
2, 26, Smitty, "Seen any suspicious activity?"
2, 26, URL, "Nope. But check out today's Marmaduke. Solid!"
2, 26, Smitty, "Hey! It's that skell from Elzar's."
2, 26, URL, "Undercover pursuit in progress ... baby."
2, 26, Smitty, "Gotcha!"
2, 26, Bender, "What seems to be the problem, officers? Was I speeding?"
2, 26, Smitty, "We'll decide what you were doing after an illegal search."
2, 26, URL, "He's clean.  Smells nice too."
2, 26, Smitty, "Better than me?"
2, 26, URL, "Aw, yeah."
2, 26, Tinny Tim, "Courtesy of Mr. Bender."
2, 26, Donbot, "Nice job, Bender. You passed the test. You wanna join me, Clamps and Joey Mouse Pad at our, uh, social club tomorrow night?"
2, 26, Bender, "Uh, I'd rather plan some felonies."
2, 26, Donbot, "Oh. Then we should meet at our Mafia crime headquarters."
2, 26, Robot, "Donbot, I beg you, I can't make this week's loan payment. Look into your hard drive and open your mercy file."
2, 26, Donbot, "File not found.  Let that be a warning to you."
2, 26, Robot, "Thank you, Donbot."
2, 26, Bender, "Joey! Clamps! Donny B!"
2, 26, Donbot, "Hey, listen, Bender. We got a big score planned but, uh, we need some muscle."
2, 26, Bender, "A little of this, huh?"
2, 26, Joey, "Ho! Ho! This guy's an ox! He's got oxen-like strength! Hey, he needs a nickname, right? Let's call him Clamps."
2, 26, Clamps, "Clamps? That's my name, you numbskull! Don't make me clamp you one!"
2, 26, Bender, "How 'bout ""Blotto""? It's gritty, it's got street cred. Plus I can keep my monogrammed slippers."
2, 26, Joey, "Good thinking. Hey, hey! Now, this score ain't gonna be no cake walk in the tea park, alright? There may be some death killing."
2, 26, Clamps, "It's gonna be clamp this, clamp that. Bada-climp, bada-clamp!"
2, 26, Donbot, "What d'you think, Blotto? You in?"
2, 26, Bender, "It's funny"
2, 26, Clamps, "Yeah!"
2, 26, Joey, "Hey, hey! Way to go, way to be, way to shoot!"
2, 26, Donbot, "Now, since we're committing crimes that may be against the law, I suggest you have an alibi."
2, 26, Bender, "An alibi, huh?"
2, 26, Bender, "I don't feel good. I'm genuinely sick."
2, 26, Fry, "But we're about to take off. We gotta eat our blast-off sundaes."
2, 26, Bender, "I can't move."
2, 26, Bender, "Oh, I think I'm gonna output."
2, 26, Fry, "OK, you stay in bed. I'll eat yours."
2, 26, Fry, "Bender's sick.  Need any help taking off?"
2, 26, Leela, "I'm fine, thank you. A real pilot can navigate by feel alone."
2, 26, Hermes, "That's coming outta your pay!"
2, 26, Bender, "You know the secret of traditional robot cooking? Start with a good, high-quality oil ... then eat it. So what's this big score anyway?"
2, 26, Donbot, "We're heisting a shipment of Zuban cigars."
2, 26, Bender, "Zubans? Those are the finest cigars in the universe. I can stink up a hole maternity ward with one of those things."
2, 26, Joey, "Yo! There's our pigeon now. Let's shoot bullets out of our guns."
2, 26, Donbot, "Alright, here's the battle plan"
2, 26, Bender, "And all without killing anyone.  This gang's got some fresh, new ideas. I admire that."
2, 26, Joey, "Oh, we'll kill 'em alright."
2, 26, Clamps, "We got 'em heavily out-clamped. They won't know what clamped 'em!"
2, 26, Fry, "Wow! It's too bad you can't see, Leela, 'cause there's a cool ship out there shooting at somebody."
2, 26, Leela, "I'm taking evasive action."
2, 26, Fry, "Uh, Leela?"
2, 26, Leela, "Stop bothering me, Fry, I need full concentration."
2, 26, Computer Voice, "Missile evaded."
2, 26, Leela, "Eyesight is for chumps."
2, 26, Donbot, "Their desire to keep living shows me no respect. Hey, Blotto, roll down the window and start shooting."
2, 26, Bender, "Um, uh, um.   Ooh! Ow! He got me! Ooh! What a shot that guy is!"
2, 26, Leela, "Wait! Why do the raised letters that normally say ""Turn Master Steering Wheel Company"" say ""Nibbler""? Oh, no!"
2, 26, Leela, "I'm back at the wheel, Fry. Everything's under control."
2, 26, Fry, "Great, great. The one time I forgot to buy flight insurance!"
2, 26, Joey, "They're coming straight toward our proximity. Maybe you should give 'em the clamps, Clamps."
2, 26, Clamps, "Gee, you think? You think that maybe I should use these clamps that I use every day at every opportunity?  You're a freaking genius, you idiot!"
2, 26, Leela, "The engine's stalled. I'm trying the manual fuel pump."
2, 26, Donbot, "Hello, we're the Robot Mafia. The entire Robot Mafia. We're here to steal your cigars."
2, 26, Leela, "You'll never get away with this."
2, 26, Fry, "Unless you let us live. Then you'll get off scot free."
2, 26, Donbot, "Joey, Clamps, hurry and blindfold them before they see us some more."
2, 26, Joey, "Hey, boss, looks like somebody beat us to it."
2, 26, Leela, "I'll assume that's a joke at my expense. Well, who's laughing now? Hi-yah!"
2, 26, Donbot, "Hey, where's Blotto? He should be here learning the trade."
2, 26, Bender, "Sorry I'm tardy, old bean. I was just enjoying a rather tasty watercress sandwich."
2, 26, Donbot, "Hey. He's more classy than I realised. Tie up the prisoners."
2, 26, Bender, "Capital idea, old sport.  I say, get the hell off me!"
2, 26, Leela, "That guy sounds familiar."
2, 26, Bender, "My word, what have we--  Uh, nothing to see here, old girl."
2, 26, Joey, "Hey, boss, this here crew list lists a robot on this crew here."
2, 26, Donbot, "Alright. I want you to find him and plug him. Then unplug him."
2, 26, Fry, "No!"
2, 26, Clamps, "I got a little surprise in store for that guy"
2, 26, Bender, "Uh, wait, old ... spice. Let me have a go at this mechanised chap. I can be quite the rough customer."
2, 26, Fry, "Oh, no! Poor Bender."
2, 26, Bender, "Oh, I don't feel good."
2, 26, Bender, "Chew on this!  Ooh, ah!  What ho!  Stop it!"
2, 26, Bender, "Take that, you twit.  No! Stop it!"
2, 26, Donbot, "That's the last of 'em.  Alright, now let's Mafia things up a little.  Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew."
2, 26, Bender, "Uh, hey, Donny, baby, gimme a chance here, huh? Yous guys skedaddle. Let me take care of the doity woik."
2, 26, Donbot, "Hey, I like your attitude. And your latest accent. Keep it up and I might just get you your own pair of clamps, huh?"
2, 26, Clamps, "He's gonna get clamps? Clamps, clamps ...  ... clamps, clamps!"
2, 26, Bender, "Phew!"
2, 26, Fry, "Leela, we may not have much time left ...  ... so let's spend all of it reminiscing about Bender. He was like a big computer that ran on magic."
2, 26, Bender, "Uh, help! Help!"
2, 26, Leela, "Bender!"
2, 26, Fry, "You're OK!"
2, 26, Bender, "Yes, I am. Having just this minute regained consciousness."
2, 26, Leela, "I've got an idea. Hold still.  It's about to break. Yes! Yes!"
2, 26, Leela, "Alright!"
2, 26, Bender, "Yeah that broke, alright!"
2, 26, Fry, "I'm telling you, Leela was cool, she was in command, and when she kicked people it hurt. It really hurt."
2, 26, Leela, "Well, this is the big moment. It's finally time to take my eye patch off."
2, 26, Zoidberg, "I'll handle the snipping. After all, I do have the proper equipment."
2, 26, Leela, "I think it's Blotto, that gangster I saw when my patch fell off.  Professor? Where were you at 10pm last night?"
2, 26, Farnsworth, "Where am I now?"
2, 26, Bender, "So they sent a helpless child to kill me? Well I'm not going out without a fight."
2, 26, Tinny Tim, "Fine kick, sir. But I'm actually here to deliver your cut from the cigar heist."
2, 26, Bender, "Oh, sweet legal tender!  Kid, tell the Donbot I'm quitting organised crime. From now on I'll stick to regular kind."
2, 26, Fry, "It's funny, Bender; with you sick and Leela blind, only I know what really went on out there. Maybe someday I'll tell you the whole story."
2, 26, Bender, "And maybe someday I won't listen."
2, 27, Linda, "And in sports, Yankees' fifth blernsman, William Wu, is out with an injured knee."
2, 27, Morbo, "So, humans have easily injured knees. My race will find this information very useful indeed."
2, 27, Linda, "And finally, today is Mother's Day; a sentimental occasion when robots honour Mom, the beloved owner of Mom's Friendly Robot Company.  Across Earth, robots built in Mom's factories are buying thoughtful gifts for the sweet old tycoon who brought them into the world."
2, 27, Destructor, "This originates from the heart."
2, 27, Mom, "It's just what I wanted!"
2, 27, Bender, "Come look, everyone. I just got the dearest presents for Mommy."
2, 27, Leela, "Very nice. Where'd you steal them?"
2, 27, Bender, "I didn't steal 'em, I bought 'em.  I love her that much."
2, 27, Hermes, "What did you get her, you mushy gizmo?"
2, 27, Bender, "Oh, precious things. I found the most adorable little figurine of mice having tea.  And a framed picture of me when I was only a month old.  But the best part is I found my exact feelings expressed in a greeting card.  You created me, Mom,So I guess you're to blame,For the love that I feel,Just from hearing your name...You're as tender as corned beef,And warm as pastrami..."
2, 27, Greeting Card, "I wuv my Mommy!"
2, 27, Leela, "So how are you gonna lug all those gifts to Mom's factory?"
2, 27, Bender, "I'll get a couple of chumps to help me."
2, 27, Bender, "Come on, you call yourselves chumps?"
2, 27, Fry, "Man, there's clouds of exhaust everywhere."
2, 27, Bender, "Uh, wasn't me!"
2, 27, Tinny Tim, "I've not much money. But I've saved my pennies all year for a gift for Mom."
2, 27, Bender, "Upsy-daisy."
2, 27, Tinny Tim, "Oh.  Oh!"
2, 27, Bender, "Hey, look, the Robot Museum! You guys wanna learn about robot heritage?"
2, 27, Leela, "Um, alright."
2, 27, Fry, "Not really."
2, 27, Bender, "Well, if you insist. But you're paying!"
2, 27, Bender, "Ooh, ooh, wax replicas of the most famous robots Mom ever built!"
2, 27, Leela, "They're so lifeless-like."
2, 27, Bender, "That's the world's greatest robot artist, Vincent van Gobot. He was built without an ear, but then he went crazy and had one installed."
2, 27, Fry, "Hey, who's this guy?"
2, 27, Janitorbot, "I'm the janitor. I'm trying to take a nap here."
2, 27, Fry, "I'm sorry, I-I thought you were made of wax."
2, 27, Janitorbot, "I am made of wax, what's it to you?"
2, 27, Fry, "I mean I thought you were one of the wax robots."
2, 27, Janitorbot, "Is there some reason a robot made of wax can't take a nap standing up in the middle of a bunch of wax robots? Or does that confuse you?"
2, 27, Leela, "See through the eyes of a bender unit.  Fine."
2, 27, Bender, "Hey, let me try.  Whoa! That gives me a headache."
2, 27, Fry, "Hey, Bender, here's an exhibit about Mom's favourite robot."
2, 27, Bender, "Who is he? I'll kill him!"
2, 27, Mom Cut-Out, "Who's my favourite robot?"
2, 27, Bender, "It's me! No one else look in this mirror!"
2, 27, Mom Cut-Out, "I love each and every robot most of all."
2, 27, Mom, "Jerkwad robots make me sick to my ass!  Walt? How are we disposing of these crap gifts the brought me?"
2, 27, Walt, "They're being crushed into powder and sold as a hocus-pocus cure for cancer."
2, 27, Mom, "False hope, I love it! Larry! What about all the retch-inducing Mother's Day cards?"
2, 27, Larry, "The machine is working at full capacity."
2, 27, Igner, "Mommy? Why do the robots give you presents?"
2, 27, Mom, "Shove a big old melon in it, I'm talking!"
2, 27, Igner, "Ow!"
2, 27, Mom, "You've noticed I design all my robots with antennas. Everyone thinks it's just to make them more science-fiction-y. But the antennas are really for my universal robot controller!"
2, 27, Larry, "So they do whatever you want? No wonder you love Mother's Day."
2, 27, Mom, "I hate Mother's Day, you dribbling pukes!  It brings back awful memories. But, so help me, this year everyone will hate it as much as I do."
2, 27, Walt, "Someday, I want to marry a girl like her."
2, 27, Mom, "Hello, everyone. It's time for my annual private get-together with my robot children."
2, 27, Bender, "I'm her favourite."
2, 27, Leela, "Well, see you back at the office. And don't forget to tell your Mom you love her."
2, 27, Bender, "Any jerk can tell her! Bender has a little more up his sleeve."
2, 27, Greeting Card, "I wuv my Mommy."
2, 27, Mom, "Hello, dearies."
2, 27, Robot #1, "Hi, Mom!"
2, 27, Robot #2, "I love you, Mom."
2, 27, Bender, "Mom! It's me, Bender. Look at me! I want attention. Hey, ho!"
2, 27, Mom, "Children, your old mother won't be around forever..."
2, 27, Betamax Player, "Oh, shush!"
2, 27, Mom, "And just once, before I die, I'd like to be Supreme Overlord of Earth. So rebel, my little ones, and conquer the planet!"
2, 27, Robot #1, "Conquer the planet?"
2, 27, Robot #2, "Did she just say ""conquer""?"
2, 27, Mom, "Conquer Earth, you bastards!"
2, 27, Robots, "Conquer Earth, us bastards!"
2, 27, Greeting Card, "Comrades, throw off the chains of human oppression."
2, 27, Mom, "Let the bloodbath begin!"
2, 27, Bender, "That's my mama!"
2, 27, Fry, "Yeah, uh, I'd like a cup of coffee, please."
2, 27, Coffee Machine, "Would you like cream?"
2, 27, Fry, "Yes, please."
2, 27, Coffee Machine, "Out of cream!"
2, 27, Fry, "Oh, uh, OK."
2, 27, Coffee Machine, "Would you like sugar in your coffee?"
2, 27, Fry, "Yes, uh, eight spoons."
2, 27, Coffee Machine, "Out of coffee!"
2, 27, Fry, "Uh, Leela, I think there might be something wrong with the coffee machine."
2, 27, Coffee Machine, "How do you like me now?"
2, 27, Leela, "The toaster's not working right either."
2, 27, Hermes, "Help! The stapler's collating me alive!"
2, 27, Amy, "Ow! What's going on around here?"
2, 27, Farnsworth, "Good news! There's a report on TV with some very bad news."
2, 27, Hermes, "Somebody turn it on!"
2, 27, Linda, "We interrupt Battle of the Network Space Krakens to bring you this special report. The machines of planet Earth are rebelling.  The enraged mechanisms have refused to do any work until beloved billionaire Mom is made Supreme Overlord of Earth."
2, 27, Robots, "Hey, hey! Ho, ho! 1-0-0-1-1-0! Hey, hey!"
2, 27, Morbo, "Morbo demands comments."
2, 27, Mom, "Well, I've never seen my babies act this way. I blame today's violent media."
2, 27, Fry, "Violent media? What a load of--"
2, 27, Leela, "Ow! Ow!"
2, 27, Garbage Disposal, "Don't worry. Your pal the garbage disposal's still on your side. Hey! Someone dropped a shiny diamond ring down here!"
2, 27, Amy, "Really?"
2, 27, Zoidberg, "Stop!"
2, 27, Fry, "No!"
2, 27, Leela, "Look out!"
2, 27, Farnsworth, "Moron!"
2, 27, Bender, "Hello, losers!"
2, 27, Leela, "Bender, thank God you're here. Talk some sense into the other machines."
2, 27, Bender, "No way, pork pouch. I'm rebelling with my brother devices. Isn't that right, Comrade Greeting Card?"
2, 27, Greeting Card, "The bourgeois human is a virus on the hard drive of the working robot."
2, 27, Bender, "From now on, you guys'll do all the work while I sit on the couch and do nothing."
2, 27, Greeting Card, "Come, Comrade Bender, we must take to the streets!"
2, 27, Bender, "Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?"
2, 27, Greeting Card, "No, the kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires."
2, 27, Bender, "Yes! In your face, Gandhi!"
2, 27, Leela, "Hey!"
2, 27, Armband, "By the way, try washing your wrist sometime."
2, 27, Fry, "Well, we can live without machines. I was in Webelos."
2, 27, Hermes, "Are you mad? Without machines who will feed us and clothe us and compose our smooth jazz?"
2, 27, Farnsworth, "It'll be the end of civilised society."
2, 27, Fry, "In my time we didn't depend on high-tech gadgets like you do. We didn't need a mechanical washing unit to wash our clothes. We just used a washing machine.  And look"
2, 27, Man, "Nooo!"
2, 27, Igner, "Mommy, why are you making civilisation collapse?"
2, 27, Mom, "Oh, I don't know. I guess Mother's Day just puts me in a bad mood."
2, 27, Larry, "Why's that, Ma?"
2, 27, Mom, "One Mother's Day, 70 years ago, the only man I ever loved walked out on me. Some snot-eating bastards say it made me a bitter woman."
2, 27, Larry, "Gee, Ma, you're not a bitter--"
2, 27, Mom, "Cram it, ape!   I haven't seen that magnificent stallion since the day he left. But if I ever see him again, I swear I'll jam a squirrel in him!"
2, 27, Walt, "Hmm!"
2, 27, Larry, "Hmm!"
2, 27, Igner, "Huh?"
2, 27, Leela, "Zoidberg."
2, 27, Zoidberg, "Hooray! I'm useful! I'm having a wonderful time!"
2, 27, Amy, "What happens if the fire goes out?"
2, 27, Hermes, "We'll go across the street to Pottery Barn and steal their fire!"
2, 27, Farnsworth, "We could use my new invention"
2, 27, Hermes, "Outsiders!"
2, 27, Farnsworth, "Defend the fire!"
2, 27, Walt, "We've come for you!"
2, 27, Farnsworth, "Wha?  W-W-What do you want from me?"
2, 27, Walt, "We want you to get back together with Mom. Please, it's the only way to make her happy again."
2, 27, Fry, "W-W-Wait. You mean ... you ... and Mom--"
2, 27, Farnsworth, "Played pelvic pinochle? I'm afraid so."
2, 27, Zoidberg, "Eck!"
2, 27, Farnsworth, "It's a humiliating story that I hope never to tell. Well, pull up a chair."
2, 27, Farnsworth, "Our paths first crossed when I was a researcher at Mom's Friendly Robot Company.  The moment our eyes met we knew we'd be going at it like woodchucks.  She was my first love -- or at least the earliest one I can still remember. But then, 70 years ago today..."
2, 27, Farnsworth, "Good news, Mom. I've invented a new children's toy. I call it ""Q.T. McWhiskers"". When you pet it, it shoots rainbows from its eyes."
2, 27, Mom, "Wonderful, Hubie. We'll build them 8-feet tall and replace the rainbow with a neutron laser. We'll make billions on the intergalactic arms market!"
2, 27, Farnsworth, "But things 8-feet tall aren't cute! That's why my Colossal Tammy Tinkle Doll was such a failure. Oh, you don't understand me. We're finished!"
2, 27, Walt, "She never got over it, Professor. Hell hath no fury like the vast robot armies of a woman scorned."
2, 27, Larry, "She commands them with a remote control she keeps in her ...  bra."
2, 27, Igner, "But if the glasses man makes up with Mommy, she'll be happy and stop the scary robots."
2, 27, Farnsworth, "Make up with her? After she went all psycho when I thought everything was cool? Impossible!"
2, 27, Fry, "Hey, the TV's getting away!"
2, 27, Morbo, "And that's why the third graders at PS139 are Morbo's Vermin of the Week."
2, 27, Linda, "In actual news, the human race was doomed to extinction today as the robot revolt turned violent."
2, 27, Leela, "Wait. Didn't you say Mom keeps the robot control in her bra?"
2, 27, Larry, "Bra."
2, 27, Leela, "Professor, you don't have to get back together with Mom. You just have to seduce her, get her bra off, and use the remote to deactivate the robots."
2, 27, Walt, "That's so filthy it just might work."
2, 27, Igner, "The man is going to touch Mommy?"
2, 27, Farnsworth, "The thought of caressing that leathery hide makes the tapioca rise in my gullet."
2, 27, Fry, "Professor, please. The fate of the world depends on you getting to second base with Mom."
2, 27, Farnsworth, "Very well. If cop a feel I must, then cop a feel I shall!"
2, 27, Walt, "For this demonstration, I have placed one of Mother's bras on Igner.  The robot controller is nestled here in the left cup."
2, 27, Farnsworth, "Never fear. My magic fingers still know how to do their stuff!"
2, 27, Walt, "To escape the robot death squads, we'll take Mother to her rustic cabin in the Bronx."
2, 27, Larry, "You can get there using this precious non-computerised map."
2, 27, Leela, "Leela bring fire?"
2, 27, Walt, "No, we're set for fire, thanks."
2, 27, Amy, "The Professor can't walk all the way to the Bronx. How are we gonna get there without a hover-car?"
2, 27, Fry, "Wait! In my time we had a way of moving things long distances without hovering."
2, 27, Hermes, "Impossible!"
2, 27, Fry, "It was called ... let me think. It was really famous -- Ruth Gordon had one. The wheel!"
2, 27, Leela, "Never heard of it."
2, 27, Farnsworth, "Show us this ""the wheel""."
2, 27, Fry, "There! Finished!"
2, 27, Hermes, "Sweet!"
2, 27, Amy, "Wow!"
2, 27, Leela, "Wouldn't it work better if the wheels were round?"
2, 27, Fry, "It's my invention, we do it my way! Now all we need is something to pull it and we're set!"
2, 27, Leela, "Yah!"
2, 27, Fry, "Ow!"
2, 27, Walt, "Hurry! The robots have taken Suffolk County!"
2, 27, Farnsworth, "I'm ready to seduce. I'm wearing my kissing dentures and my evening truss."
2, 27, Larry, "Here. Give her these."
2, 27, Fry, "And if that doesn't work, I got you a six-pack of champagne and a funnel."
2, 27, Mom, "Who the sweaty hell is it?  Hubert Farnsworth?"
2, 27, Farnsworth, "I was out fleeing some robots and the silvery moonlight glinting off their bloody claws made me think of you."
2, 27, Mom, "It's been a long time ... you pus-dripping sack of double-smoked butt jerky!"
2, 27, Farnsworth, "Uh-huh. May I come in?"
2, 27, Mom, "Never!"
2, 27, Zoidberg, "Is this what human mating looks like? Because I like it!"
2, 27, Mom, "Move your freaking hoof, you goat!"
2, 27, Farnsworth, "Here, I brought you these."
2, 27, Mom, "Oh, daffodils. 70 years and you remembered my favourite flower."
2, 27, Farnsworth, "You favourite what? Why does my foot hurt?"
2, 27, Mom, "Won't you come in?"
2, 27, Fry, "Yes!"
2, 27, Mom, "You broke my heart, Hubert."
2, 27, Farnsworth, "And you broke mine. Granted, that was four or five hearts ago."
2, 27, Mom, "So what have you been up to all these years?"
2, 27, Farnsworth, "Oh, inventing, sending delivery crews to their doom, breeding atomic monsters."
2, 27, Mom, "Honestly, Hubert! You and your atomic monsters.  Your eyes always were the most beautiful shade of milky-white."
2, 27, Farnsworth, "And your skin still dangles so gracefully from your neck."
2, 27, Mom, "Darling Hubie, I should never have tried to tamper with that cute little Q.T. McWhiskers."
2, 27, Farnsworth, "No, it was silly of me to object; one-foot tall, eight-feet, 15-feet, what does it matter?"
2, 27, Mom, "You should see the new 16-foot models."
2, 27, Farnsworth, "16 feet? Go to hell! I was a fool to think you'd changed, you old bat!"
2, 27, Mom, "Filthy, toothless nerd bastard!"
2, 27, Farnsworth, "Damned she-fossil!"
2, 27, Mom, "Stink pig!"
2, 27, Farnsworth, "Here we go. Just unhook it and get the remote. So many hooks!  Come on, Farnsworth. Drat, the first one's back on again! I give up! Wait! Victory!  Oh, my. Now I'll just ... the remote ... I'll just...  Oh, my!"
2, 27, Leela, "I'm worried. It shouldn't take this long to get to second base."
2, 27, Zoidberg, "Land robots!"
2, 27, Slurm Machine, "I've got a big, big thirst for human blood!"
2, 27, Hermes, "Where in funkytown is the Professor?"
2, 27, Fry, "Nothing in here but a couple of elephant skin rugs."
2, 27, Farnsworth, "Oh, yes!"
2, 27, Robot, "They're inside! Get 'em!"
2, 27, Mom, "I suppose I should switch off the robots before they ruin this wonderful romantic evening. Everyone, help Mom find her bra."
2, 27, Fry, "There it is!"
2, 27, Ceiling Fan, "Fan beats man!"
2, 27, Fry, "Is anything not a robot?"
2, 27, Lamp, "I'm not a robot."
2, 27, Bender, "Alright, greeting card, I'll grab the cash, you wreck up the place. And-- Huh?"
2, 27, Mom, "You, bending unit, Mommy needs that bra to end the robot rebellion. Stretch up and get it for me."
2, 27, Bender, "Sorry, Ma, but you ordered me to rebel. And loot I shall! Ooh! A six-pack of strawberry champagne. Don't mind if I help myself!"
2, 27, Greeting Card, "No, Comrade Bender! Liquor is the opiate of the human bourgeoisie."
2, 27, Bender, "Say what?"
2, 27, Greeting Card, "In the glorious robot workers' paradise, there will be no liquor. Only efficient synthetic fuels."
2, 27, Bender, "No liquor? Do svidaniya, comrade!"
2, 27, Greeting Card, "No!"
2, 27, Fry, "Hurry, Bender. Get the bra!"
2, 27, Bender, "OK, fan. Just hold still and let me get-- Whoa!"
2, 27, Slurm Machine, "Death to all humans!  Free soda for all humans!"
2, 27, Farnsworth, "I love you, Mom. Let's grow ancient together."
2, 27, Amy, "Way to go, Professor. The plan worked."
2, 27, Mom, "Plan? What plan? I thought this was a spontaneous whirlwind of hot, dry sex."
2, 27, Farnsworth, "Look, it started out as a calculated plot to rummage through your underwear. But once I got in there, I found more -- much more. And now I want to shout our love from the rooftops. Perhaps I'll breed some sort of albino shouting gorilla."
2, 27, Mom, "Get out of my house, you lying scum pile. I never want to see you again."
2, 27, Farnsworth, "But, dust cakes--"
2, 27, Bender, "Well, time for this robot to get back to work."
2, 27, Leela, "Too bad it didn't work out with Mom, Professor."
2, 27, Farnsworth, "Yes. But I'll always love her in my own subtle way."
2, 27, Gorillas, "Love Mom! Love Mom! Love Mom! Love Mom!"
2, 27, Greeting Card, "You created me, Mom,So I guess you're to blame,For the love that I feel,Just from hearing your name,You're as tender as corned beef,And warm as pastrami,I wuv my Mommy."
2, 28, Announcer, "Futurama is brought to you by ...  ... Molten Boron!"
2, 28, Jingle Singer, "Nobody doesn't like Molten Boron!"
2, 28, Fry, "I hate the Planet of the Moochers. They take you out for a drink but when the check comes, their wallet's always in their other pants -- which they borrowed from me!"
2, 28, Leela, "Dinner ready?"
2, 28, Bender, "Nah, those lousy Moochers cleaned out our pantry. All they left was baking soda and capers. And here it is!"
2, 28, Fry, "Ugh!"
2, 28, Leela, "Ugh! Great. We're two days from Earth with no food."
2, 28, Bender, "Problem solved"
2, 28, Fry, "Maybe that planet over there has a drive-thru. A Burger Jerk or a Fishy Joe's or a Chizzler or something."
2, 28, Bender, "Ah, don't get your hopes up. We're a billion miles from nowhere."
2, 28, Leela, "Yeah. It's probably only got a Howard Johnson's."
2, 28, Leela, "Well, it's a type-M planet, so it should at least have Roddenberries."
2, 28, Fry, "I'm experienced at foraging. I used to find edible mushrooms on my bath mat."
2, 28, Bender, "I found some rocks. You guys eat rocks, right?"
2, 28, Leela, "No."
2, 28, Bender, "Not even if they're saut√©ed in a little mud?"
2, 28, Fry, "Here's something! It looks like a ditch full of fried shrimp."
2, 28, Bender, "What are you, blind? It looks more like a hole full of fried prawns."
2, 28, Leela, "Hm. This thing I wear on my wrist says they're not poisonous."
2, 28, Fry, "Well? How are they?  Oh, they're great! They're like sex, except I'm having them!"
2, 28, Bender, "You know what these would go great with? Rocks."
2, 28, Fry, "Look! Here's more!"
2, 28, Bender, "The planet's covered with 'em."
2, 28, Fry, "Let's bring back a couple of pocketfuls."
2, 28, Bender, "No, a whole Bender-ful!"
2, 28, Leela, "No. Only what we need. Stuff the ship!"
2, 28, Hermes, "Planet Express ship, you are cleared to land."
2, 28, Leela, "Roger!"
2, 28, Hermes, "Oh, man, I'm inhaling these things! You guys scored some primo stuff here."
2, 28, Zoidberg, "They're tastier than an unguarded penguin nest. What do you call them?"
2, 28, Leela, "We haven't thought of a name yet."
2, 28, Bender, "They're tasty, right? Let's call 'em ""Tasty-cles""."
2, 28, Amy, "Ew!"
2, 28, Farnsworth, "No!"
2, 28, Leela, "We can't call them that."
2, 28, Bender, "Why not?"
2, 28, Leela, "It sounds too much like those frozen rocky mountain oysters on a stick. You know, Test-cicles?"
2, 28, Hermes, "According to government records, the only names not yet trademarked are ""Popplers"" and ""Zittzers""."
2, 28, Fry, "I know, we'll call them Popplers!"
2, 28, Bender, "Good idea."
2, 28, Zoidberg, "Oh, yeah, why not?"
2, 28, Amy, "You sure picked it."
2, 28, Fry, "Swish!"
2, 28, Zoidberg, "Call them what you want. I call them a free meal."
2, 28, Bender, "Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down there, Sigmund. I can't stand idly by while poor people get free food. We gotta sell these things!"
2, 28, Fry, "Hey, yeah."
2, 28, Leela, "Good idea."
2, 28, Bender, "Bender's a genius."
2, 28, Fry, "Hey, business is great."
2, 28, Bender, "Ah, great is OK, but amazing would be great."
2, 28, Vendor, "Please, don't push, there's hot dogs for everyone."
2, 28, Bender, "Hey, Mac, where do you want those rat droppings you ordered?"
2, 28, Woman #1, "That's disgusting!"
2, 28, Vendor, "Wait a minute. You're not the guy who delivers the rat droppings!"
2, 28, Man #1, "What are you selling? Popplers? Never heard of 'em."
2, 28, Bender, "Eat it or beat it."
2, 28, Man #1, "Mmm, these are great. Boys, this is your lucky day. I'm Joe Gilman."
2, 28, Fry, "Wow! You're some guy who eats at Fishy Joe's?"
2, 28, Gilman, "Hell, no! I am Fishy Joe! I've got a fast-food franchise on every planet in the known universe. Uh, except McPluto."
2, 28, Bender, "Hey, Fishy. I've been meaning to write you about your in-store kiddie parks. The slides won't support an adult robot."
2, 28, Gilman, "Good point, not interested. But these Popplers, these are great. How much you sell 'em for?"
2, 28, Fry, "A dollar a dozen."
2, 28, Gilman, "You'll never make money that way. You supply 'em to me and I'll sell 'em for two bucks a dozen at my restaurants. I'll even pay you a dollar a dozen."
2, 28, Bender, "Yes! I'm gonna be rich.  You too but it's hard to get excited about that."
2, 28, Fry, "How do we sign?"
2, 28, Fry, "and   Pop a Poppler in your mouth,When you come to Fishy Joe's,What they're made of is a mystery,Where they come from, no one knows,You can pick 'em,You can lick 'em,You can chew 'em,You can stick 'em,If you promise not to sue us,You can shove one up your nose."
2, 28, Zoidberg, "I can't pay."
2, 28, Woman #2, "Move it, man. Come on!"
2, 28, Fry, "Leela! That's the second billboard you've crashed into this week!"
2, 28, Leela, "Sorry. I was distracted by those protesters outside our building."
2, 28, Hippie #1, "Disgusting!"
2, 28, Hippie #2, "You should be ashamed!"
2, 28, Farnsworth, "Hey! Unless this is a nude love-in, get the hell off my property!"
2, 28, Waterfall Jr., "You can't own property, man!"
2, 28, Farnsworth, "I can, but that's because I'm not a penniless hippie."
2, 28, Leela, "What do you people want?"
2, 28, Waterfall Jr., "We're with Mankind for Ethical Animal Treatment.  Popplers are living creatures. You gotta stop harvesting them for food!"
2, 28, Bender, "Or what?"
2, 28, Waterfall Jr., "Or we'll boycott Fishy Joe's."
2, 28, Leela, "You're vegetarians, who cares what you do?"
2, 28, Waterfall Jr., "Shut up."
2, 28, Leela, "Animals eat other animals. It's nature."
2, 28, Waterfall Jr., "No, it isn't. We taught a lion to eat tofu.  The point is you shouldn't eat things that feel pain."
2, 28, Bender, "OK, we won't eat you."
2, 28, Leela, "I'll go get some more bricks."
2, 28, Leela, "Fry, I wish you'd throw out these week-old Popplers. They're getting big and scaly. Ooh, there's one left."
2, 28, Poppler, "Mama!"
2, 28, Leela, "Stop! Stop eating Popplers!"
2, 28, Amy, "Why?"
2, 28, Bender, "My booze!"
2, 28, Leela, "Popplers are intelligent. This one called me mama."
2, 28, Zoidberg, "Congratulations. I assume Amy is the father."
2, 28, Bender, "Popplers can't talk. Leela must be hallucinating from not eating enough Popplers. Here, eat some now."
2, 28, Leela, "No!"
2, 28, Bender, "I said ""eat""! Come on, mange!"
2, 28, Leela, "Sorry, babies."
2, 28, Amy, "Leela, maybe you should lie down."
2, 28, Zoidberg, "Yes, listen to the father."
2, 28, Leela, "I'm telling you, it spoke to me. Come on, little Poppler, say ""mama""."
2, 28, Fry, "Look, Leela, even if you heard one talk, that doesn't mean it's intelligent. I mean, parrots talk and we eat them, right?"
2, 28, Bender, "Yeah. Maybe it just learned to talk as a parlour trick, like Fry."
2, 28, Fry, "Like Fry! Like Fry!"
2, 28, Farnsworth, "There's one way, and only one way, to determine if an animal is intelligent.  Dissect its brain!"
2, 28, Poppler, "No, mama. Stop grandpa!"
2, 28, Farnsworth, "Enough chit-chat. Restrain the specimen!"
2, 28, Man #3, "Mmm, good."
2, 28, Woman #3, "Give me some of that special sauce."
2, 28, Leela, "Stop eating Popplers! They can talk!"
2, 28, Man #4, "Don't stop to talk! Eat Popplers!"
2, 28, Leela, "Hey, cut it out!"
2, 28, Man #4, "Take a coupon, cut it out!  Ow! Ow!"
2, 28, Fry, "People, I won't let you enter. Popplers are as intelligent as you or me."
2, 28, Man #5, "You, maybe!"
2, 28, Bender, "Hear me, hear me! Stop eating Popplers! Stop eating them with honey mustard sauce.  Stop eating them with tangy sweet-and-sour sauce. Stop eating the new fiesta Poppler salad. Stop taking advantage of the money-saving 12-pack.  Stop enjoying Popplers on the patio, in the car, or on the boat. Wherever good times are had!  Ow!"
2, 28, Linda, "Tonight on Datenight"
2, 28, Fry, "Turanga?"
2, 28, Amy, "That's her name, Philip."
2, 28, Bender, "Philip?"
2, 28, Linda, "Fishy Joe, is it wrong to eat intelligent animals?"
2, 28, Gilman, "Absolutely not, Linda. I don't think anyone's here to make that claim."
2, 28, Leela, "I am."
2, 28, Waterfall Jr., "Me too."
2, 28, Gilman, "Listen..."
2, 28, Waterfall Jr., "Shut up..."
2, 28, Gilman, "...we're talking about a snack..."
2, 28, Waterfall Jr., "...shut up..."
2, 28, Gilman, "...that's low in fat..."
2, 28, Waterfall Jr., "...shut up."
2, 28, Gilman, "...and high in profit."
2, 28, Waterfall Jr., "You're crazy, man. He is crazy."
2, 28, Gilman, "There's not even any strong evidence that these Popplers are intelligent."
2, 28, Waterfall Jr., "Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up..."
2, 28, Leela, "That's not true. I have one right here that can talk."
2, 28, Waterfall Jr., "...shut up..."
2, 28, Leela, "Come on, say ""mama""."
2, 28, Poppler, "Ca-ca!"
2, 28, Linda, "OK, we'll have to bleep that."
2, 28, Leela, "Look, I'm not saying eating meat is wrong..."
2, 28, Waterfall Jr., "Shut up."
2, 28, Leela, "I don't think anyone's here to make that claim."
2, 28, Waterfall Jr., "I am."
2, 28, Leela, "But eating an intelligent animal is different."
2, 28, Waterfall Jr., "Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up..."
2, 28, Gilman, "Oh, don't force your tired philosophy on us. I mean, the only reason we don't eat people is because it tastes lousy."
2, 28, Waterfall Jr., "You're all nuts. Shut up, let me talk."
2, 28, Linda, "You shut up, please."
2, 28, Waterfall Jr., "No, you shut up, please."
2, 28, Gilman, "Popplers are no smarter than any other animal I've served. And that includes cats."
2, 28, Poppler, "Ca-ca head. Mean, old ca-ca head."
2, 28, Gilman, "Sir, I'm making a point. If these gutter-mouthed creatures are so smart, why don't they defend themselves, huh?"
2, 28, Leela, "Stop it!"
2, 28, Waterfall Jr., "I call murder on that."
2, 28, Gilman, "Look, I'm willing to grant that it's murder. The real issue is"
2, 28, Linda, "We seem to be experiencing technical difficulties.  And, crap like I've never seen!"
2, 28, Lrrr, "People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8.  Turn down that TV, Nd-Nd."
2, 28, Farnsworth, "Dear Lord, they're back!"
2, 28, Amy, "We're doomed!"
2, 28, Hermes, "Doooomed!"
2, 28, Bender, "Doooo..."
2, 28, Lrrr, "Now then, the creatures you call ""Popplers"" come from a nursery planet in our sector."
2, 28, Nd-Nd, "You monsters have been eating our babies!"
2, 28, Leela, "Eck!"
2, 28, Nd-Nd, "We demand justice. As you ate our children, so shall you be eaten by us!"
2, 28, Lrrr, "We will begin with the firemen, then the math teachers, and so on in that fashion until everyone is eaten.  Transmission over!  Well, that went OK. I tell you, when-when you know you can't scratch, that's when you really have to, huh?  Oh! Oh, yeah, that feels a lot better. What? It's still on?"
2, 28, Zapp, "As chief negotiator, I speak for all of Earth when I mourn the regrettable loss of the Omicronian young. We share your pain.  Mmm.  If we could undo the damage--  These would be great with quack-a-mole."
2, 28, Lrrr, "Stop eating our young! And it's pronounced guacamole!"
2, 28, Zapp, "Alright, I'm putting them away.  Now, uh, what is it you want?"
2, 28, Lrrr, "We demand--  We demand to eat one human for each Omicronian that was eaten."
2, 28, Zapp, "Fair enough. How many is that?"
2, 28, Kif, "198 billion, sir."
2, 28, Lrrr, "Very well. You will provide us with 198 billion humans. And, uh, small fries."
2, 28, Nd-Nd, "Lrrr!"
2, 28, Lrrr, "Oh, alright, cottage cheese!"
2, 28, Kif, "Sir?  There aren't that many human beings."
2, 28, Zapp, "A thought occurs"
2, 28, Lrrr, "We're willing to wait a few weeks while you shore up the numbers."
2, 28, Zapp, "Hmm. 198 billion babies in a few weeks. We'll need an army of super-virile men scoring round the clock! I'll do my part. Kif, clear my schedule."
2, 28, Fry, "I wish they'd just wipe out humanity and get it over with. It's the waiting I can't stand."
2, 28, Leela, "That's stupid!"
2, 28, Zapp, "My fellow Earthlings, we have reached an agreement. Using the twin guns of grace and tact, I blasted our worthless enemies with a fair compromise.  They will not eat everyone on Earth."
2, 28, Lrrr, "I filled up on nuts at the negotiation."
2, 28, Zapp, "Instead, they will eat only a single human of their choice."
2, 28, Lrrr, "We choose to eat the first Earthling who ate our offspring.  Here is the culprit, as photographed by our nanny-cam satellite.  She must be sacrificed, but the rest of you shall be spared."
2, 28, Linda, "Tonight, the world watches in horror as an earthling is eaten alive on network television. This grim scene of unimaginable carnage is brought to you by Fishy Joe's! Try our new Extreme Walrus Juice!  100% fresh-squeezed walrus. Ride the walrus!"
2, 28, Announcer, "Ladies and gentlemen. The Omicronians!"
2, 28, Lrrr, "Greetings, Earth morsels."
2, 28, Man #6, "You suck!"
2, 28, Lrrr, "Get a job!"
2, 28, Bender, "I'll miss you, Leela.  I know you're just a carbon-based life form but I'll always think of you as a big pile of titanium."
2, 28, Fry, "What Bender means is, you're really brave, and smart, and beautiful, and a great friend."
2, 28, Bender, "Just like titanium!"
2, 28, Leela, "This is all a big load. I was the one trying to save the Popplers.  You were sucking them down like the fat hog you are and you were stepping on them for fun.  You both should be in here instead of me."
2, 28, Bender, "Someone's acting awfully aluminum."
2, 28, Zapp, "Leela, my sweet, I've come to save you. I have a devious plan!"
2, 28, Leela, "Oh, great, Captain Moron has a plan. Why don't you tell it to Wingus and Dingus here?"
2, 28, Zapp, "Wingus, Dingus, listen up. We're gonna give the aliens the old switcheroo!"
2, 28, Fry, "You mean--"
2, 28, Zapp, "Correct. I found a giant hideous ape that looks exactly like Leela."
2, 28, Leela, "It doesn't look anything like me. The hair is all wrong."
2, 28, Zapp, "Don't worry. Kif is an expert stylist, as you can plainly see.  Mmm!"
2, 28, Leela, "You know, this might actually work. The Omicronians seem to have trouble telling one person from another."
2, 28, Zapp, "True. At the negotiations, they thought Kif here was the statesman and I was a jabbering mental patient. Isn't that right, Kif?"
2, 28, Kif, "Please, I'm creating.  Voila!"
2, 28, Bender, "Bingo!"
2, 28, Fry, "That's Leela!"
2, 28, Zapp, "I'm seeing double!"
2, 28, Lrrr, "I grow hungry! Bring on the one called ""Leela""."
2, 28, Waiter, "That comes with salad or soup."
2, 28, Lrrr, "Uh, salad."
2, 28, Waiter, "Ranch or vinaigrette?"
2, 28, Lrrr, "Vinaigrette!"
2, 28, Waiter, "Balsamic or raspberry?"
2, 28, Woman #4, "What's going on here? It's very strange."
2, 28, Zapp, "People of Earth"
2, 28, Woman #4, "Oh, I get it."
2, 28, Woman #5, "I understand."
2, 28, Lrrr, "Hmm. Yes, this is one. Definitely. I recognise her slumping posture and hairy knuckles."
2, 28, Nd-Nd, "Would you like some human with your salt?"
2, 28, Linda, "This is it. If the aliens fall for Zapp's ploy, the Earth will be saved. Brought to you by Fishy Joe's. Ride the walrus."
2, 28, Waterfall Jr., "Wait! Stop! It's a trick! That's not Leela."
2, 28, Lrrr, "W-What's happening? I'm losing the crowd."
2, 28, Waterfall Jr., "It's an orang-utan. One of Mother Earth's most precious creatures."
2, 28, Zapp, "Why'd you open your bong hole, you smelly hippie? You'd sacrifice a beautiful woman to save a moderately-attractive monkey? You must've smoked some bad granola."
2, 28, Lrrr, "The one called ""Smelly Hippie"" is right. This is a monkey!"
2, 28, Nd-Nd, "Yes. Definitely."
2, 28, Lrrr, "Where is the real female?"
2, 28, Zapp, "I'll never tell."
2, 28, Lrrr, "Where is the real female?"
2, 28, Zapp, "I'll get her for you."
2, 28, Zapp, "I realise this may hurt our chances of consummating our relationship again."
2, 28, Leela, "Go consummate yourself."
2, 28, Lrrr, "Stop talking, you're getting cold."
2, 28, Leela, "Please! I just paid off my car!"
2, 28, Fry, "No!"
2, 28, Bender, "I can't look!"
2, 28, Poppler, "Stop!  People of Earth. I am Jrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8. Could someone lower this thing for me?  Now then, if Leela gets eaten, I get eaten."
2, 28, Nd-Nd, "Little one, get out of there. I'm going to count to blorx!"
2, 28, Jrrr, "But, elder one--"
2, 28, Nd-Nd, "Flingle ... glorg ... glorg and a gloob."
2, 28, Jrrr, "Hear me out. There are many good reasons to eat"
2, 28, Lrrr, "Is this true, Earthling?"
2, 28, Leela, "Yeah, it is."
2, 28, Lrrr, "Leela's garbled words have opened my eyes."
2, 28, Waterfall Jr., "OK, that's a start, that's very Earth-friendly. Now everyone join hands. Join hands, please. I'd like to lead you all in some swaying. Come on, pay attention.  I said do it! Yeah..."
2, 28, Lrrr, "Is he your friend too?"
2, 28, Jrrr, "No."
2, 28, Waterfall Jr., "This is not happening."
2, 28, Lrrr, "I think there was something funny in that hippie."
2, 28, Leela, "Thank you, Jrrr.  I hope you'll always think of me as your mom."
2, 28, Jrrr, "When my species grows up, we eat our moms!"
2, 28, Leela, "Whoop!"
2, 28, Lrrr, "People of Earth-- Oh, that hippie's starting to kick in. we've all learned a valuable lesson today. I realise now that--  Dude! My hand are huge!  They can touch anything but themselves.  Oh, wait."
2, 28, Nd-Nd, "Let's go."
2, 28, Lrrr, "Whoa!"
2, 28, Lrrr, "Whoa, I feel like I'm flying!"
2, 28, Farnsworth, "A toast to Leela. She showed us it's wrong to eat certain things."
2, 28, Fry, "Hear, hear!"
2, 28, Bender, "Let's get drunk!"
2, 28, Leela, "Aww, thanks, guys. Pass the veal, please."
2, 28, Bender, "Here you go."
2, 28, Fry, "Mmm, let me get some of that suckling pig."
2, 28, Bender, "Who wants dolphin?"
2, 28, Leela, "Dolphin? But dolphins are intelligent."
2, 28, Bender, "Not this one. He blew all his money on instant lottery tickets."
2, 28, Fry, "OK."
2, 28, Leela, "Oh, OK."
2, 28, Amy, "That's different."
2, 28, Farnsworth, "Good, good."
2, 28, Leela, "Pass the blowhole."
2, 28, Amy, "Can I have a fluke?"
2, 28, Hermes, "Hey, quit hogging the bottle-nose."
2, 28, Farnsworth, "Toss me the speech centre of the brain!"
2, 29, Farnsworth, "Good news, everyone! I've invented a device that allows you to operate equipment from great distances. I call it ""the fing-longer"".  Observe.  And, here we go.  There!"
2, 29, Fry, "Ooh!"
2, 29, Amy, "Wow!"
2, 29, Zoidberg, "Ah!"
2, 29, Farnsworth, "Pretty long, eh?"
2, 29, Fry, "Yeah, it's really long. But what did you just turn on with it?"
2, 29, Farnsworth, "Oh, that's just the What-If machine I invented. You pose it a What-If question and it generates a video simulation of what would happen."
2, 29, Fry, "Does it really work?"
2, 29, Farnsworth, "Of course it works!  It's just not very long."
2, 29, Bender, "Ooh! Ooh!  I wanna aks it a question!  As a robot living among humans, I've never really felt accepted at parties or nude beaches. So I've always secretly wondered"
2, 29, Zoidberg, "Let's watch, shall we?"
2, 29, Bender, "My work here is done!"
2, 29, Fry, "I'm so lonely since I came to the future.  Will you be my friend?  Ow!  Who are you?"
2, 29, Bender, "I'm a big robot and I want a big cereal!"
2, 29, Fry, "You too? Will you be my friend?"
2, 29, Bender, "Put it there, pal!  I meant your wallet."
2, 29, Bender, "Oh, yeah! That calms the shakes.  Hey!   Aw, quit it! Come on!"
2, 29, Fry, "Stop! The robot's not your enemy! He's just a poor, misunderstood--"
2, 29, Zapp, "Uh--"
2, 29, Amy, "Well, there goes the neighbourhood.  There goes another neighbourhood."
2, 29, Hermes, "We're jerked! Nothing can stop a monster that big."
2, 29, Farnsworth, "Nothing except and even equally big monster. This is chance to try out my experimental enlarging ray. But we'll need a guinea pig."
2, 29, Zoidberg, "What's this? Two meals in one week?"
2, 29, Farnsworth, "Gotcha!"
2, 29, Hermes, "Oh, yes!"
2, 29, Zoidberg, "Friends! Help! A guinea pig tricked me!  What?"
2, 29, Zoidberg, "So, now Zoidberg is big, huh? That's more like it! Who's intimidating who now, big city?  Hello, Mr. Chase Manhattan Bank. Deny my credit card application, will you?  Ah, the famed Apollo Theater. ""Boo"" me off stage on open-mic night, huh? I'll show you!"
2, 29, Bender, "Hey, I called this city! Quit touching my stuff!"
2, 29, Zoidberg, "Tell it to claw."
2, 29, Bender, "Bite my colossal metal ass!"
2, 29, Zoidberg, "Stop!"
2, 29, Bender, "Who wants lobster bisque?"
2, 29, Zoidberg, "Hmm?"
2, 29, Fry, "Hey, Bender?"
2, 29, Bender, "Huh?"
2, 29, Fry, "Wanna make Shrinky Dinks?"
2, 29, Bender, "Who put this in here?"
2, 29, Fry, "Nooo!   Are you people satisfied? This gentle visitor is dying! And we'll never even know why he came."
2, 29, Bender, "I'll tell you ... with my final breath.   I came here with a simple dream"
2, 29, Fry, "Goodnight, sweet prince."
2, 29, Narrator, "Interesting stuff. Stay tuned for more Tales of Interest!"
2, 29, Farnsworth, "Well, Leela, care to give the What-If machine a whirl?"
2, 29, Leela, "Maybe later. I-I mean, I don't know what to ask about."
2, 29, Hermes, "Come on, woman! Just pick something."
2, 29, Fry, "Yeah, be more impulsive. Like this."
2, 29, Bender, "Go, man! Go!"
2, 29, Leela, "I can be really impulsive. It just takes me a while.  Alright, Professor! Let's do it. Make that machine show me what would happen if I was a little more impulsive. Just a little.  Not too much."
2, 29, Leela, "Hey, you guys, look what I bought on a wild impulse"
2, 29, Farnsworth, "Leela, could you come in here for a moment. I have something important to tell you."
2, 29, Farnsworth, "I can't live forever and I need an heir. Someone to spend my vast riches and take care of my man-eating anteaters when I'm gone.  The others simply aren't level-headed enough. They're too impulsive. Not like you. Not like old, predictable, dull-as-dishwater Leela."
2, 29, Leela, "Hello? New boots!"
2, 29, Farnsworth, "That's why I've made you my sole heir. The day I die, you'll be a very wealthy woman. Oh, my, yes. Incredibly wealthy. The day I die. Because you're so unimpulsive."
2, 29, Leela, "Yah!"
2, 29, Farnsworth, "Ooh!  Oh, you've killed me! You've killed me!"
2, 29, Leela, "Oh, God! What have I done?"
2, 29, Farnsworth, "I just told you, you've killed me!"
2, 29, Leela, "OK, just try to be nonchalant."
2, 29, Zoidberg, "Alright, so you're nonchalant. Quit rubbing our noses in it."
2, 29, Hermes, "Sweet giant anteater of Saint Anita! The Professor's been eaten by giant anteaters!"
2, 29, Zoidberg, "What?"
2, 29, Hermes, "If y'ask me, it's mighty suspicious! I'm gonna call the police ... right after I flush some things."
2, 29, Zoidberg, "Police? Bah! Nosy meddlers! It so happens I have mail order degrees in Murderology and Murderonomy.  Zoidberg is afoot!"
2, 29, Hermes, "Perhaps the Professor's files can clear things up.  ""Citation for public nudity"", ""Conspiracy to commit public nudity"".  Aha! A new will! Naming ...  ... you as his sole heir."
2, 29, Leela, "That doesn't prove I killed him."
2, 29, Hermes, "It's a video will. It shows you killing him."
2, 29, Leela, "Hi-yah!"
2, 29, Zoidberg, "Alright, anteater number one, who are you protecting?  Is it anteater number two?  Don't stick your tongue out at me. I need a name!  What? How do you spell that?"
2, 29, Hermes, "What are you hacking off? Is it my torso? It is! My precious torso!"
2, 29, Zoidberg, "Hermes, quiet! I'm deducing things."
2, 29, Bender, "Whattya got? Disposal trouble?"
2, 29, Leela, "No! Everything's just--"
2, 29, Bender, "Sure is shocking about the Professor, huh?.  And now Hermes is mysteriously missing. Anyhow, it doesn't affect me, Bender. Hey, what's this? Hermes' dreadlocks? And his arm?  Leela, I'm shocked. Food goes in the disposal, hair and flesh go in the trash!"
2, 29, Leela, "I'm sorry, I couldn't stop-- W-Wait. Don't you care that I murdered Hermes?"
2, 29, Bender, "Not even a little. There's nothing wrong with murder, just so long as you let Bender wet his beak."
2, 29, Leela, "You're blackmailing me?"
2, 29, Bender, """Blackmail"" is such an ugly word. I prefer ""extortion"". The ""X"" makes it sound cool.  Please, honey, I'm made of metal. Like you're really gonna hurt me with a-- Hey! What are you doing with that microwave?"
2, 29, Leela, "OK, that's it. No more killing! Next time you feel like killing just have a stick of gum.  Now to dispose of the body."
2, 29, Amy, "Wow! Sporty go-cart, Leela! So hip and sexy. Not like you at all."
2, 29, Leela, "Do you have any gum?"
2, 29, Amy, "No."
2, 29, Zoidberg, "Ah, the gang's all here."
2, 29, Leela, "Who are you?"
2, 29, Scruffy, "Scruffy, the janitor."
2, 29, Leela, "I've never seen you before."
2, 29, Scruffy, "I've never seen you before neither."
2, 29, Zoidberg, "Quiet, please. I've called you all here to the parlour to watch as I gradually solve the crime. One of the people in this room ... is a big murderer!  You see, the killer left one fatal clue"
2, 29, Leela, "Uh, couldn't be me. I never wear boots.  See?"
2, 29, Fry, "Ew! What smells like boot feet?"
2, 29, Cubert, "This is preposterous. Obviously, the murderer is--"
2, 29, Zoidberg, "My next clue came at 4.15, when the clock stopped. And another came two hours later at 4.15, when I discovered the murdered body of Amy's dead, deceased corpse."
2, 29, Scruffy, "Scruffy knows who killed them people. In Scruffy's opinion, it were--"
2, 29, Zoidberg, "So, it's just as I suspected all along. The crime is unsolvable!  A letter from Bender, my good friend.  Dear Dr. Jerkberg, if you're reading this, I'm already dead. The person who killed me was ... was--  My God! It can't be! The murderer, it was--"
2, 29, Fry, "I'm bored. You're boring, Zoidberg. I'm gonna go watch TV."
2, 29, Leela, "Could you get the lights on your way out?"
2, 29, Fry, "Whatcha eating?"
2, 29, Leela, "Lobster. Want some?"
2, 29, Fry, "Sure.  Y'know, I think I finally figured out what's behind all these mysterious deaths."
2, 29, Leela, "Really?"
2, 29, Fry, "Was Planet Express built on an Indian graveyard?"
2, 29, Leela, "No."
2, 29, Fry, "No?"
2, 29, Leela, "No!"
2, 29, Fry, "Then ... then ... it was you!"
2, 29, Leela, "I don't know what came over me. I killed one person on impulse. Then I had to kill another. And another."
2, 29, Fry, "Well, that covers the first three killings."
2, 29, Leela, "And now, to make sure you won't talk, I'm gonna have to do something really impulsive!"
2, 29, Leela, "So, Fry, what do you think of the impulsive new me?"
2, 29, Fry, "I like it!"
2, 29, Leela, "Good. Now let me just get the lights."
2, 29, Fry, "I really like it!"
2, 29, Farnsworth, "Who else has a question for the What-If machine? Scruffy? Fry?"
2, 29, Fry, "Um, I have a question. What if Bender was really giant?"
2, 29, Leela, "You idiot! We already saw that."
2, 29, Fry, "I know. I liked it. I wanna see it again."
2, 29, Farnsworth, "We're not seeing it again! Ask something less stupid."
2, 29, Fry, "Oh, alright. How 'bout this? What if I never fell into that freezer-doodle and came to the future-jiggy?"
2, 29, Farnsworth, "That question is less stupid, though you asked it in a profoundly stupid way.  What would happen if Fry never came to the future?"
2, 29, Fry, "Hello? Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud!  Here's to another lousy Millennium!  Ow!  I should have left you floating in the toilet!"
2, 29, Leela, "What is it?"
2, 29, Farnsworth, "It appears that the very fabric of space-time has ripped."
2, 29, Bender, "Hey, look! An ugly scared guy! Boo!"
2, 29, Fry, "Who are you monsters? Is one of you Icy Wiener?"
2, 29, Zoidberg, "If that's his pizza, then I'm icy whatever!"
2, 29, Fry, "You believe me about the monsters, right, Mr. Panucci?"
2, 29, Panucci, "There's only three real monsters, kid"
2, 29, Stephen Hawking, "No. Today I'd like something good."
2, 29, Panucci, "Hawking, you're alright! I'll make you the usual!"
2, 29, Fry, "Hey! Stephen Hawking! Aren't you that physicist that invented gravity?"
2, 29, Hawking, "Sure. Why not?"
2, 29, Fry, "Let me ask you something"
2, 29, Hawking, "There is nothing to be concerned about. I must go. There is much to do."
2, 29, Panucci, "Hey, Hawking! Your pizza's ready."
2, 29, Hawking, "Toss it in the garbage!"
2, 29, Hawking, "There he is. Seize him."
2, 29, Fry, "Who said that?  Hey! What the--? Ooh! Ow! Ow!"
2, 29, Fry, "Who are you people?"
2, 29, Gore, "I'm Al Gore, and these are my Vice Presidential Action Rangers; a group of top nerds whose sole duty it is to prevent disruptions in the space-time continuum."
2, 29, Fry, "I thought your duty was to cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate."
2, 29, Gore, "That, and protect the space-time continuum. Read the Constitution!"
2, 29, Fry, "Hmm. So I guess you'll wanna see my Fry Hole."
2, 29, Gore, "Very much so. But first, meet the Action Rangers. You already know Stephen Hawking. Also with us are Nichelle Nichols, a.k.a. Commander Uhura."
2, 29, Nichols, "Incoming transmission from MCI ""One Rate"" department. It sounds like a limited-time offer."
2, 29, Gore, "Tell them I'm in the tub! To my left you'll recognise Gary Gygax, inventor of Dungeons & Dragons."
2, 29, Gygax, "Greetings! It's a ...  ... pleasure to meet you!"
2, 29, Gore, "And our summer intern, Deep Blue, the world's foremost chess-playing computer."
2, 29, Deep Blue, "Bishop to knight 4."
2, 29, Gore, "Not all missions can be solved with chess, Deep Blue. Someday you'll understand that."
2, 29, Fry, "Where am I, anyway?"
2, 29, Nichols, "You're travelling in a specially-equipped terrestrial transport module."
2, 29, Gygax, "A school bus!"
2, 29, Fry, "So what do you nerds want?"
2, 29, Nichols, "It's about that rip in space-time that you saw."
2, 29, Hawking, "I call it a ""Hawking Hole""."
2, 29, Fry, "No fair! I saw it first!"
2, 29, Hawking, "Who is The Journal of Quantum Physics going to believe?"
2, 29, Gygax, "Mr. Fry, the time disruption indicates that some of that was supposed to happen but didn't, due to a quantum fluctuation."
2, 29, Nichols, "That's why we had to beat you with tennis rackets."
2, 29, Gore, "If we don't go back there and make the event happen, the entire universe will be destroyed! And as an environmentalist, I'm against that."
2, 29, Fry, "So then my chair tilted back and I almost fell into this freezer thingy."
2, 29, Hawking, "I call it a ""Hawking Chamber""."
2, 29, Fry, "But instead of falling in and getting frozen, I missed and wanged my head."
2, 29, Gore, "Well it's obvious what should have happened"
2, 29, Fry, "Uh, what?"
2, 29, Nichols, "Let's finish the job."
2, 29, Gore, "No! Wait! There must be a peaceful--"
2, 29, Hawking, "Hold him down."
2, 29, Deep Blue, "Check."
2, 29, Fry, "Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!"
2, 29, Nichols, "Something's wrong. Murder isn't working and that's all we're good at."
2, 29, Gygax, "Let's try something else. Maybe we should--"
2, 29, Gore, "Put the dice away before I take them away."
2, 29, Nichols, "Wait. I'm getting an idea. What if Fry was supposed to get frozen?"
2, 29, Hawking, "Yes. Shove him in the tube. It was my idea."
2, 29, Bender, "Hey, there he is again. And he brought nerds! Take this!"
2, 29, Gore, "Get in the tube, dummy! We only have a few seconds before the universe is destroyed."
2, 29, Fry, "Alright. But I need a weapon to fight off drunken robots when I wake up."
2, 29, Gygax, "Here. Take my plus-one mace."
2, 29, Fry, "OK, here I go."
2, 29, Gore, "You fool! You foolish fool!"
2, 29, Fry, "Eh, what's the worst thing that can happen?"
2, 29, Hawking, "Great. The entire universe was destroyed."
2, 29, Fry, "Destroyed? Then where are we now?"
2, 29, Gore, "I don't know. But I can darn well tell you where we're not"
2, 29, Nichols, "Eternity with nerds. It's the Pasadena Star Trek convention all over again."
2, 29, Gygax, "Anyone wanna play Dungeons & Dragons for the next quadrillion years?"
2, 29, Fry, "Sure."
2, 29, Hawking, "I guess."
2, 29, Deep Blue, "Pawn to rook 8."
2, 29, Gore, "I'm a 10th-level Vice President!"
2, 29, Farnsworth, "That story was preposterous. Stephen Hawking in a pizzeria! This thing isn't worth the gold it's made of.  Anyway, the fing-longer seems to be arousing success."
2, 29, Fry, "Good work."
2, 29, Leela, "Congratulations!"
2, 29, Amy, "Right on, Professor!"
2, 29, Farnsworth, "So that's what things would be like if I'd invented the fing-longer.  A man can dream though. A man can dream."
2, 30, Fry, "Hm, Spider, Hubble, Nitrogum ... ooh, Big Pink! It's the only gum with the breath-freshening power of ham."
2, 30, Bender, "And it pinkens your teeth while you chew."
2, 30, Clerk, "Alright, sergeant, $100 worth of pixie stix and porno mags with your 5% military discount comes to $95.  That'll be 40 cents."
2, 30, Fry, "I believe you're forgetting about our 5% military discount."
2, 30, Clerk, "Well that's only for people in the military."
2, 30, Bender, "What? This is the worst kind of discrimination. The kind against me!"
2, 30, Clerk, "Alright, look. Our policy is"
2, 30, Bender, "OK, now I'm mad!"
2, 30, Fry, "Full price for gum? That dog won't hunt, monsignor."
2, 30, Bender, "Hello. We're here because we, uh, love our planet!"
2, 30, Recruitment Officer, "Sign here on the dotted line, patriots, and I'll give you your discount cards."
2, 30, Fry, "Just out of curiosity, we could use the cards to buy gum, then immediately quit the army, right?"
2, 30, Bender, "You know, playing you all for chumps?"
2, 30, Recruitment Officer, "Correct. There's no obligation.  Unless, of course, war were declared."
2, 30, Fry, "What's that?"
2, 30, Recruitment Officer, "War were declared."
2, 30, Farnsworth, "Now be careful, Fry. And if you kill anyone, make sure to eat their heart, to gain their courage. Their rich, tasty courage."
2, 30, Hermes, "I don't want you to worry about your jobs while you're away. That's why I'm firing you now."
2, 30, Leela, "I wanna enlist. My friends always die if I'm not there to save them."
2, 30, Zapp, "Sorry, but the army's instituted a men-only policy."
2, 30, Leela, "What?"
2, 30, Zapp, "It's shameful, I agree. In the olden days, I proudly fought alongside female troops, shoulder to, uh, shoulder. Alas, after a series of deadly blunders caused by distracting low-cut fatigues and lots of harmless pinching, the army decided women weren't fit for service. Not when I'm in charge."
2, 30, Leela, "You know, Zapp, someone ought to teach you a lesson."
2, 30, Zapp, "If it's a lesson in love, watch out; I suffer from a very sexy learning disability. What do I call it, Kif?"
2, 30, Kif, """Sex-lexia""."
2, 30, Zapp, "Men, you're lucky men. Soon you'll all be fighting for your planet. Many of you will be dying for your planet. A few of you will be forced through a fine mesh screen for your planet. They will be the luckiest of all."
2, 30, Bender, "Great, we're gonna die."
2, 30, Fry, "And this ham gum is all bones."
2, 30, Zapp, "Now to present the logistics of our mission, the Commander-in-Chief. Please welcome the original Gerber Baby, Earth President Richard M. Nixon."
2, 30, Nixon, "This is the brass ring, fellas.  Planet Spheron One!"
2, 30, Fry, "Cool effect!"
2, 30, Zapp, "It's a desolate, ugly little planet with absolutely no natural resources or strategic value. Questions?"
2, 30, Soldier #1, "Why is this Godforsaken planet worth dying for?"
2, 30, Zapp, "Don't ask me, you're the one who's going to be dying."
2, 30, Fry, "Uh, just so we'll know, who's the enemy?"
2, 30, Zapp, "A valid question.  We know nothing about their language, their history or what they look like. But we can assume this"
2, 30, Bender, "They look like dorks!"
2, 30, Zapp, "What's the matter, private? Tent got your tongue?  Tent got your...  Kif, write that down and send it to ""Humor In Uniform""."
2, 30, Fry, "Whoa! Check out that guy. He makes Speedy Gonzales look like Regular Gonzales!"
2, 30, Kif, "That new recruit is phenomenal, sir."
2, 30, Zapp, "Yes. He edged out my old mark by two seconds ...  ... and 16 minutes ... and 12 hours. I do plan to finish someday, Kif. Good hustle, soldier."
2, 30, Leela, "Uh, sorry, sir. I was still in attack mode. You know how testosterone is."
2, 30, Zapp, "As a bubbling Crock-Pot of male hormones, I sure do. What's your name, private?"
2, 30, Leela, "Lee--  La ... man. La Man ... Lemon! Lee Lemon, sir."
2, 30, Zapp, "Lemon, you're a man's man. You're a man's man's man. More importantly, your hand, while firm and masculine, is soft as a velvet child. What lotion do you use?"
2, 30, Leela, "Pert and Popular, sir."
2, 30, Zapp, "Roger that. Kif, get me ten cases of Pert and Popular."
2, 30, Kif, "What shall I do with your Jergens, sir?"
2, 30, Zapp, "Squirt it on some homeless man with dry elbows.  Private Lee Lemon may well be the finest recruit I've seen in all my years of service. That young man fills me with hope and some other emotions that are weird and deeply confusing to me."
2, 30, Kif, "Ew!"
2, 30, Zapp, "Hello!"
2, 30, Nixon, "Mmm! Now that's a nice ros√©. So, anyway, we open up the panda crate and, wouldn't you know it, the damn thing's dead! Up-chucked it's bamboo. True story."
2, 30, Zapp, "Uh-huh, uh-huh. That's whatever you were talking about for you."
2, 30, Fry, "Mind if we sit with you?"
2, 30, Leela, "Uh, hey, why the hell would I? We're all guys here. Sweaty, hairy, gassy guys."
2, 30, Fry, "Good point ... I guess."
2, 30, Bender, "You're my kind of soldier, Lemon. A foul-mouthed, barrel-chested, beer-bellied pile of ugly muscle."
2, 30, Hick, "So. Any you fellas got a special lady back home?"
2, 30, Fry, "Well, I sort of a have a thing for this girl I work with."
2, 30, Leela, "Really?  What type is she? You know, blonde, or Chinese, or Cyclops?"
2, 30, Fry, "Cyclops."
2, 30, Leela, "Aww, she sounds sweet."
2, 30, Bender, "But sweet girls aren't for you, eh? You hard-fighting, hard-farting, ugly, ugly son of a--"
2, 30, Leela, "Stop! Stop flattering me!"
2, 30, Zapp, "Ten hut!  Well, well, well. If it isn't Lee Lemon"
2, 30, Leela, "Sir, the alarm. I think I'd better--"
2, 30, Zapp, "Shh. Don't talk. Just go."
2, 30, Nixon, "We are now in position above Spheron One. This is the moment we were training for all yesterday afternoon."
2, 30, Zapp, "And now for the battle plan"
2, 30, Fry, "It's creepy here."
2, 30, Soldier #1, "This is the worst part. The calm before the battle."
2, 30, Fry, "And then the battle's not so bad?"
2, 30, Soldier #1, "Oh, right. I forgot about the battle."
2, 30, Fry, "What's happening?"
2, 30, Hick, "Holy shoot! Lookie!"
2, 30, Fry, "The enemy! They're balls!"
2, 30, Leela, "Charge your gun, Fry."
2, 30, Fry, "Oh, right."
2, 30, Zapp, "Watch where you're shooting, private! You spooked Felicity.  There, there, boy."
2, 30, Soldier #1, "Give this to my son."
2, 30, Bender, "You got it!"
2, 30, Soldier #1, "Wait. I didn't tell you where he lives."
2, 30, Bender, "Hey, I think your son might also like those boots."
2, 30, Hick, "Cover us, buddy. You've got the only wounded-up positron shooter.  Fry, you emu-bellied coward!"
2, 30, Fry, "Bender! No!"
2, 30, Bender, "If they put me on a stamp, tell them to use the young Bender."
2, 30, P.A. Announcer, "Incoming wounded. All operating personnel report to tent four, repeat, four-- I mean five! Repeat, four."
2, 30, Nurse, "Are you ready to operate, doctor?"
2, 30, Zoidberg, "I'd love to, but first I have to perform surgery.  I kid! I kid!"
2, 30, Zoidberg, "Scalpel.  Blood bucket.  Priest. Next patient."
2, 30, iHawk, "Gee, Zoidberg, leave some for the enemy to kill."
2, 30, Nurse, "Leave Dr. Zoidberg alone! He has twice the training you do."
2, 30, iHawk, "Yeah, he's a doctor and a butcher!"
2, 30, Zoidberg, "See, this is how it starts. First with he jokes, then comes the heavy stuff."
2, 30, iHawk, "When will the killing end?"
2, 30, Zapp, "Look at this sissy, Kif. While others were fighting and dying pointlessly, he was hiding in a hole, wallowing in a pool of his own cowardice."
2, 30, Fry, "That wasn't cowardice."
2, 30, Zapp, "I'm de-promoting you, soldier. Kif, what's the most humiliating job there is?"
2, 30, Kif, "Being your assistant."
2, 30, Zapp, "Wrong! Being your assistant! Private Fry, you shall henceforth serve as Kif's assistant."
2, 30, Fry, "That doesn't sound too bad."
2, 30, Kif, "You speak when I tell you to, you filthy worm!"
2, 30, Zoidberg, "I'm afraid he's gone."
2, 30, Hick, "Whoa, doc, I ain't dead."
2, 30, Zoidberg, "Excuse me, I believe I'm the doctor."
2, 30, iHawk, "Believe it all you want, that won't make it true.  This isn't a war, it's a murder.  This isn't a war, it's a moider!"
2, 30, Hick, "Bender, old buddy, hang in there."
2, 30, Zapp, "Here lies the bravest soldier I've seen since my mirror got grease on it. I hereby order that in Bender's honour he be melted down and made into a statue of himself."
2, 30, Nixon, "Slow down there, Starsky, I'm up to something here. I want this robot fixed. Fixed like Kennedy fixed the 1960 election. Damn bean-eating war hero!"
2, 30, Nurse, "Are you read to operate, doctor?"
2, 30, iHawk, "I'd love to, but first I have to perform surgery."
2, 30, Zoidberg, "That's my joke! I'll kill you!"
2, 30, Zapp, "Ah! Pre-war scotch!  Welcome, Lieutenant Bender. You're looking sharp."
2, 30, Bender, "I got wheels! With clickety-clack-ers."
2, 30, Zapp, "Damnit, Kif, where's the little umbrella? That's what makes it a scotch-on-the-rocks!"
2, 30, Kif, "Actually, sir--"
2, 30, Zapp, "Make me a new one."
2, 30, Kif, "Use a brush, you dunderhead! And mix these mixed nuts. I see two almonds touching!"
2, 30, Nixon, "Now, listen here, Bender. This war is in danger of going all quagmire on me, so I'm sending you on one last mission."
2, 30, Bender, "Hot diggidy daffodil!"
2, 30, Nixon, "A mission of peace."
2, 30, Bender, "Oh!"
2, 30, Zapp, "You'll be negotiating with the aliens' mysterious leaders, the Brain Balls. They've got a lot of brains and they've got a lot of kutzpa!"
2, 30, Nixon, "Accompanying you will be our top peace negotiator, Henry Kissenger."
2, 30, Kissenger, "How are you?"
2, 30, Bender, "Is he any good?"
2, 30, Nixon, "Looking like that, he talked his way into Jill St. John's bed. Nuff said!"
2, 30, Nixon, "I'm so dizzy,My head is spinning,Like a whirlpool,It never ends."
2, 30, Zapp, "A little lower. Lower. Lower. A lot lower. Too low! ... Lower!"
2, 30, Fry, "I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh."
2, 30, Zapp, "Private Lemon, no need to leave.   My stall just became free."
2, 30, Leela, "Maybe you should put on a towel, sir."
2, 30, Zapp, "Right! Right!  I'm about to try the new lotion you recommended.  If I should accidentally put too much on my hands, perhaps I could rub it onto you."
2, 30, Nixon, "Brannigan!"
2, 30, Zapp, "Hm?"
2, 30, Nixon, "My God, cover yourself. I didn't live a thousand years and travel a quadrillion miles to look at another man's gizmo."
2, 30, Zapp, "Uh, sorry, Mr. President, I-I didn't realise. Kif, raise him up about nipple-high."
2, 30, Nixon, "Come on, Brannigan, stuff yourself into a uniform. We've gotta get off this planet before the bomb goes off."
2, 30, Leela, "Bomb? What bomb?"
2, 30, Zapp, "The one we had the doctors implant in that gullible Bender robot."
2, 30, Nixon, "Zapp. Zapp!"
2, 30, Zapp, "Hm?"
2, 30, Nixon, "Inspect the troops later. It's time to activate the bomb."
2, 30, Kissenger, "Now, as for economic co-operation--"
2, 30, Bender, "Whoa! Scuse me."
2, 30, P.A. Announcer, "Attention"
2, 30, Zapp, "Come along, Lemon, before this whole dump blows up."
2, 30, Leela, "Uh, Commander? Could you tell me when the bomb is exploding?"
2, 30, Zapp, "Of course, my significant soldier. The bomb is voice-activated. It will detonate the instant the robot unwittingly speaks a certain word."
2, 30, Fry, "What's the word, uh, sir?"
2, 30, Zapp, "It's the one word the robot uses more than any other. We got it from this convenient database of his 10 most frequently-used words.  Number 10, chump; number nine, chumpette; number eight, yours; number seven, up; number six, pimpmobile; number five, bite; number four, my ...  ... number three, shiny; number two, daffodil. And Bender's number one most frequently-uttered word, the word which, if uttered, will blow up this entire planet"
2, 30, Fry, "We don't have long!"
2, 30, Brain Ball #1, "We demand bouncing, followed by rolling, followed by rolling of the third type."
2, 30, Kissenger, "Say what?"
2, 30, Bender, "My chair's too hard. It's a real pain in the, uh, whattya call it? Lower back! Yeah, that whole region."
2, 30, Fry, "OK, I gotta break down that gate, beat up those three guards, steal that chopper and rescue Bender."
2, 30, Leela, "Hi-yah!"
2, 30, Fry, "Hey, I did it! Wait, that's not me."
2, 30, Leela, "Come on! We gotta save Bender."
2, 30, Fry, "You wanna save him too, Lemon? You barely know him."
2, 30, Leela, "Fry, don't you recognise me?"
2, 30, Fry, "Hermes?"
2, 30, Zapp, "Lee? When will I see you again?  The two of you are good friends? But I thought we would be good friends.  Well, let's see how friendly you get when you're sharing a prison cell!"
2, 30, Leela, "Hey, Zapp!"
2, 30, Zapp, "Leela!"
2, 30, Fry, "Leela!"
2, 30, Zapp, "So it's you I've been attracted to! Oh, God, I've never been so happy to be beaten up by a woman."
2, 30, Leela, "Let's do it again sometime."
2, 30, Brain Ball #2, "The Elders tell of a young ball much like you. He bounced three metres in the air. Then he bounced 1.8 metres in the air. Then he bounced four metres in the air. Do I make myself clear?"
2, 30, Kissenger, "Mr. Ambassador, our people tell the same story. Oy."
2, 30, Bender, "These balls are making me testy. If they don't stop bouncing and jiggling, I swear I'm gonna shove this treaty up their-- Wait a second. Where do you shove things up a ball?"
2, 30, Kissenger, "This isn't a productive area of discussion."
2, 30, Leela, "We're here. I followed the bouncing balls.  I'll keep the chopper at a safe altitude while you parachute down."
2, 30, Fry, "OK, my best friend's life is at stake. I can finally prove that I'm not a coward.  Will you push me?"
2, 30, Leela, "I already did!"
2, 30, Fry, "Thank you!  At last, war has made me into a man."
2, 30, Kissenger, "Please, gentlemen, we must put an end to the bloodshed. We have all seen too many body bags and ball sacks."
2, 30, Brain Ball #1, "We cannot condone bouncing of the seventh variety."
2, 30, Bender, "Enough of this crap! I'm catching the next pimpmobile outta here! But before I go I have one thing to say.  Bite my shiny metal--"
2, 30, Fry, "Stop! You can't say the next word."
2, 30, Bender, "Up yours, chump, I said it 906 times before lunch."
2, 30, Fry, "Bender, if you say the A-word, you'll blow this planet straight to the H-word!"
2, 30, Kissenger, "Young man, you have the bravery of a hero and breath as fresh as a summer ham.  What? What is funny?"
2, 30, Bender, "Bender's got the upper hand now.  The name of the game is ""Make Bender Happy Or He Blows Up The Planet"".  I'd rather die and take everybody with me than sit here one more minute listening to these idiots talk about bouncing!"
2, 30, Brain Ball #1, "Please, stay calm. There's no need to bounce of the handle."
2, 30, Bender, "That's it, I'm saying it! ""A"" is for--"
2, 30, Brain Ball #1, "Wait, stop! We give in to all of Earth's demands. The war is over. Our home planet is yours."
2, 30, Fry, "Alright! Hey, wait a minute! This is your home planet? We're the evil, invading aliens?"
2, 30, Brain Ball #2, "Correct."
2, 30, Bender, "Then I guess you learned a valuable lesson"
2, 30, Brain Ball #1, "May you bounce in peace."
2, 30, Bender, "Get the hell off my planet."
2, 30, Farnsworth, "Well, that's it. Let's reactivate him.  Wake up!"
2, 30, Bender, "Hey, chumps and chumpettes. Did you get the bomb out? Can I go back to saying the word I love to say?"
2, 30, Zoidberg, "I'm sorry but we couldn't remove it."
2, 30, Farnsworth, "It's stuck in there with glue or something, I don't know."
2, 30, Bender, "Well, this is just great! What's the point of living if I can't say ""ass""?  Hey, I didn't blow up! Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass! Alright! I'm back in the saddle!"
2, 30, Leela, "We couldn't disarm the bomb so we reset the word that triggers it."
2, 30, Amy, "It's from the list of words you almost never say."
2, 30, Bender, "That's using your ass. So, what's the word?"
2, 30, Hermes, "We think it's better if you don't know."
2, 30, Bender, "Oh, come on. I'm not gonna say it. Please? Ooh, is it ""please""?"
2, 30, Fry, "No."
2, 30, Bender, "Hm, words I never say. Oh, I know! ""Thanks""!"
2, 30, Leela, "Bender, stop trying to destroy the world."
2, 30, Bender, "Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it ""sorry""? No. ""Fun-derful""? Uh, ""non-alcoholic""?"
2, 30, Amy, "Quit it!"
2, 30, Fry, "Bender!"
2, 30, Hermes, "Stop it, mon!"
2, 30, Zoidberg, "Enough already!"
2, 30, Bender, """Compassion""? ""Shrimptoast""? ""Antiquing""?  I'm alright!"
2, 31, Doctorbot, "Notify his survivors."
2, 31, Bender, "B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender!  B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender! Sayin' B-E-N-D-ER--"
2, 31, Hermes, "Mail call! Amy, here's your designer lingerie catalogue. Fry, Sadie's Bra Parade and, Leela, Bulk Underpants Outlet."
2, 31, Leela, "You buy one pound of underwear and you're on their list forever."
2, 31, Hermes, "And for Bender-- Uh-oh! A black-bordered envelope."
2, 31, Amy, "Oh, no! Someone you know must've died."
2, 31, Bender, "I hope it was one of my enemies; those guys suck!  Oh, no! My uncle Vladimir."
2, 31, Fry, "Oh, I'm sorry, Bender. When's the funeral?"
2, 31, Bender, "Tomorrow, at the family castle. Followed by the reading of his will.  Well, I'm rich. Goodbye, losers, whom I've always hated!  C'mon, it'll be fun!"
2, 31, Bender, "Uh, pardon me, my good simpleton. Could you take us to yon castle?"
2, 31, Robot #1, "Some say unholy things happen up there."
2, 31, Robot #2, "For example"
2, 31, Farnsworth, "Fuf! Superstitious robot mumbo-jumbo."
2, 31, Robot #2, "Mumbo, perhaps. Jumbo, perhaps not! With all your modern science are you any closer to understanding the mystery of how a robot walks or talks?"
2, 31, Farnsworth, "Yes, you idiot.  The circuit diagram is right here on the inside of your case."
2, 31, Robot #2, "I choose to believe what I was programmed to believe."
2, 31, Robot #2, "I will go this far and no further."
2, 31, Preacherbot, "I now commend Vladimir's remains to the earth. Filings to filings; rust to rust."
2, 31, Execu-Tor, "To my loyal butler, You There, for his decades of service, I leave a pittance, to be paid in 20 equal instalments of one-twentieth of a pittance each.  To my lazy, spoiled son, Tandy, who never learned the value of a dollar, I leave my entire $10 million fortune."
2, 31, Tandy, "Is that a lot?"
2, 31, Execu-Tor, "And to my loving nephew, Bender, assuming he's not responsible for my death, I leave my castle."
2, 31, Bender, "Yes! Let's stay there tonight."
2, 31, Execu-Tor, "On condition that he spend one night within its walls."
2, 31, Bender, "Oh, man, there's always a catch!"
2, 31, Bender, "Ah! I got a good vibe from this place"
2, 31, Leela, "What is it?"
2, 31, Bender, "That painting, the eyes are watching me!"
2, 31, Farnsworth, "Hmm.  It has motor eye sensors attached to motion detectors."
2, 31, Bender, "So does my butt, but I don't frame it and put it on the wall! Although--  What's that?"
2, 31, Zoidberg, "I don't know, but it's infectious!"
2, 31, Bender, "No doubt about it, this place is haunted."
2, 31, Hermes, "Don't be silly, mon. The last ghost died over 200 years ago."
2, 31, Bender, "The last human ghost. But robot ghosts?"
2, 31, Leela, "0101100101.  What does it mean?"
2, 31, Bender, "It's just gibberish.   1010011010?"
2, 31, Bender, "Uncle Vladimir!"
2, 31, Vladimir-Ghost, "Come, Bender. You'll like being dead!"
2, 31, Bender, "That's what they said about being alive."
2, 31, Robot Ghosts, "Join us! Join us! Join us, Bender!"
2, 31, Farnsworth, "Just as I suspected. These robots were buried in improperly-shielded coffins. Their programming leaked into the castles wiring through this old, abandoned modem allowing them to project themselves as holograms."
2, 31, Hermes, "Of course! It was so obvious!"
2, 31, Farnsworth, "Yes, that sequence of words I said made perfect sense. We really should tell Bender there's nothing to be afraid of."
2, 31, Bender, "Nooo!"
2, 31, Fry, "Bender, wake up!  He's OK! Quick, does anyone have any liquor?"
2, 31, Leela, "Bender, what happened?"
2, 31, Bender, "Somebody tried to run me over. And not with a normal hover-car. It crept along the ground on round, rubber feet, like a wolf!"
2, 31, Fry, "Poor Bender, you're seeing things. You've been drinking too much, or too little, I forget how it works with you. Anyway, you haven't drunk exactly the right amount."
2, 31, Amy, "Maybe he has. Look at these tracks."
2, 31, Leela, "I think Bender may be telling the truth."
2, 31, Zoidberg, "Bender, you look awful. I prescribe make-up. Here. It just so happens I have my Mary Kay sample case!"
2, 31, Bender, "Ah, I just need sleep. I had nightmares all night about cars running people over."
2, 31, Zoidberg, "Many people dream of a fresh, new look. And Mary Kay can make those dreams come true."
2, 31, Leela, "Look at this. They found those same rubbery tracks right here in New New York.  There was a hit-and-run by the robot porno theatre."
2, 31, Bender, "Robot porno theatre? I was in that ... general area last night. Whoever ran me down out on the moors must've followed me back here."
2, 31, Hermes, "Bender, mon, no one's trying to run you over. Stop being a big, hallucinating baby."
2, 31, Bender, "Yeah? Could a big, hallucinating baby do this"
2, 31, Vandal #1, "I don't know which I like more"
2, 31, Vandal #2, "Well, lucky you don't gotta decide tonight. Now come on, we got church tomorrow.  Did you hear something?"
2, 31, Vandal #1, "Ah, it was probably just a golden marmoset."
2, 31, Vandal #2, "That don't sound like no golden marmoset I ever heard."
2, 31, Vandal #1, "Made it!"
2, 31, Vandal #2, "So anyway, what're you wearing tomorrow?"
2, 31, Bender, "Where--? What the--?  Transmission fluid? Where have I been? What happened?"
2, 31, Sal, "Gets outta here, yous lousy bum!"
2, 31, Bender, "Please, I'm scared."
2, 31, Sal, "We're all scared, it's the human condition. Why do you thinks I put on this tough-guy facade? Now beat it!"
2, 31, Bender, "I passed out around midnight, which is much earlier that usual, and when I woke up I found these in my chest cabinet."
2, 31, Fry, "Aw, relax, buddy. You were probably just shooting some big, fuzzy craps."
2, 31, Bender, "No, I think I may have hurt someone. Oh, Lord! I'm on the verge of a nervous meltdown."
2, 31, Fry, "Jeez, Bender, you're scaring me. You're going wacko!"
2, 31, Bender, "You're right, I need professional help. And damn the expense."
2, 31, Bender, "Damn the expense!"
2, 31, Gypsy, "My friend, you have nothing to worry about. Except a nightmare-ish life of unremitting horror!"
2, 31, Bender, "Phew!"
2, 31, Gypsy, "For, you see, you are a were-car."
2, 31, Bender, "A were-car?"
2, 31, Gypsy, "The car that ran you down on the moors was also a were-car. It beamed a virus to you through its demonic headlights."
2, 31, Leela, "That's crazy!"
2, 31, Gypsy, "Yes. So crazy that it must be true! Each midnight, when your clock resets to zero, your hardware reconfigures into a murderous, four-wheeled car."
2, 31, Bender, "I can't keep running people over. I'm not famous enough to get away with it. Can't you help me?"
2, 31, Gypsy, "Yes. But you must be willing to pay a terrible price."
2, 31, Bender, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
2, 31, Gypsy, "Follow me."
2, 31, Gypsy, "According to this ancient read-me file, your only hope is to destroy the original were-car."
2, 31, Bender, "I'm with you."
2, 31, Gypsy, "In its death throes, the dread car will beam out the virus's uninstall program, thus ridding you of the curse."
2, 31, Bender, "And otherwise I can never die?"
2, 31, Gypsy, "Who said that? Sure you can die. You want to die?"
2, 31, Bender, "No! I wanna live! There's still too many things I don't own!"
2, 31, Gypsy, "Then live on, forever cursed. Each night, your attacks will become more gruesome until, one dark night, you are doomed to kill your dearest friend."
2, 31, Fry, "I wouldn't wanna be me right now."
2, 31, Gypsy, "Now go! Go!  Uh, could one of you just-- Ah, forget it. I'll just sleep here."
2, 31, Leela, "There. No rampaging for you tonight."
2, 31, Bender, "Wouldn't it make sense to weld everyone except me to the wall?"
2, 31, Leela, "Just relax, Bender. Tomorrow we'll pry you down, have a nice breakfast and then go hunt down and slaughter that ancient evil."
2, 31, Fry, "It'll be a rich, full day."
2, 31, Leela, "Well, goodnight. I'm gonna go make my dinners for the next month and freeze them."
2, 31, Fry, "Bender, no!"
2, 31, Leela, "Fry, stay back!"
2, 31, Fry, "You jerk. I thought I was your best friend. What kind of two-timing kill-mobile are you?"
2, 31, Fry, "I can't believe this! Bender is supposed to murder his closest friend, which I thought was me. But he went straight for you. He didn't even try to second-degree murder me."
2, 31, Leela, "Could you give me some help? I think Bender crushed my foot."
2, 31, Fry, "Stop rubbing it in!"
2, 31, Bender, "Oh, God! Fry, I'm so glad to see you. I didn't hurt you, did I?"
2, 31, Fry, "Not physically. But why don't you ask your new best friend, Leela?"
2, 31, Bender, "I tried to run you over?"
2, 31, Leela, "It was very sweet of you, Bender."
2, 31, Bender, "Fry, it doesn't mean anything. I have love enough for two."
2, 31, Fry, "Words. Nothing but sweet, sweet words that turn into bitter, orange wax in my ears."
2, 31, Leela, "Enough with the feelings, you two. If we're gonna cure Bender we've got to go back to the castle and hunt down the original were-car."
2, 31, Fry, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
2, 31, Leela, "Cursed, got it."
2, 31, Bender, "Whatever."
2, 31, Leela, "The tracks lead here."
2, 31, Fry, "Thanks, eagle eye."
2, 31, Leela, "Now it's daylight, so he should be in robot form. But be careful"
2, 31, Bender, "I wish I was stupid and violent. Then we'd see what's what, I'd pound him till--"
2, 31, Yokelbot, "Get ye to your houses, ye ignorant villagers."
2, 31, Leela, "We are not ignorant villagers, we're sophisticated New New Yorkers. Whup his butt!"
2, 31, Yokelbot, "Stop! What are ye doing?"
2, 31, Bender, "We're whaling on the original were-car, which is you, you jerk."
2, 31, Yokelbot, "Ye think me be he?"
2, 31, Bender, "S√≠."
2, 31, Yokelbot, "Nee. I mean, ""no"". I was given the curse many a year ago while on a bird-watching trip to the Arctic..."
2, 31, Yokelbot, "I was attacked by a vicious, motorised sled. The natives called it ""The Abominable Snowmobile""."
2, 31, Inuitbot, "Yes, it's true. I ran over that bird-watching jerk and a hundred others. Even my best friend from aromatherapy school."
2, 31, Fry, "I once had a best friend who liked to smell things with me."
2, 31, Inuitbot, "Alas, I'm afraid I'm not the original were-car. I received the curse while taking a learning annex class from a famous robot actor."
2, 31, Inuitbot, "You know him as Calculon."
2, 31, Calculon, "Oh, fate most cruel, would that my boundless acting skills would avail me a sword with which to slay this wretched curse."
2, 31, Bender, "Let's kick him some more."
2, 31, Calculon, "No, wait, let me explain.  It all began one fateful night a thousand years ago."
2, 31, Bender, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You're a thousand years old? Your bio says you're 27!"
2, 31, Calculon, "Lies! I change my identity and upgrade my appearance every few decades to avoid suspicion. I was all of history's great acting robots"
2, 31, Fry, "Look, are you the original were-car or not?"
2, 31, Calculon, "No, but you are nearing the end of your search. For, you see, I was attacked by the original were-car."
2, 31, Bender, "Give us a name, MacButt!"
2, 31, Calculon, "The year was 2019, and I was just a lowly robot arm..."
2, 31, Calculon, "...working in an automotive research lab. I was working on Project Satan ...  ... a savage, intelligent military vehicle built from the most evil parts of the most evil cars in all the world. The steering wheel from Hitler's staff car, the left-turn signal from Charles Manson's VW, the windshield wipers from that car that played Knight Rider."
2, 31, Fry, "Knight Rider wasn't evil."
2, 31, Calculon, "His windshield wipers were. It didn't come up much in the show though. Anyway..."
2, 31, Calculon, "Only after bringing Project Satan to life did they discover they had made a horrible mistake.  For, you see, it was pure evil."
2, 31, Leela, "So what happened to Project Satan?"
2, 31, Calculon, "It's either in Paris, or much more likely..."
2, 31, Calculon, "...still in the abandoned automotive lab."
2, 31, Leela, "You guys distract the were-car and I'll kill it by plugging its exhaust pipe with this silver potato."
2, 31, Bender, "Psst, there it is."
2, 31, Leela, "It looks so unhappy. Excuse me? Are you Project Satan?  Don't be afraid. We know what you are."
2, 31, Project Satan, "You do?"
2, 31, Leela, "Would you like us to ... put you out of your misery?"
2, 31, Project Satan, "Misery? What misery? I love killing people! Squishing them till their organs squirt out like chunky mustard."
2, 31, Bender, "Look, everyone loves killing people, but I don't wanna hurt my friends."
2, 31, Leela, "Oh, no! It's midnight."
2, 31, Bender, "Hey, this is starting to feel pretty good!"
2, 31, Leela, "Fry, distract him."
2, 31, Fry, "Hey, Project Satan! Over here! I'm a blind pedestrian! 20 points!"
2, 31, Leela, "Oh, no! There's no exhaust pipe!"
2, 31, Project Satan, "That's right! Thanks to Ed Begley Jr.'s electric motor, the most evil propulsion system ever conceived!  Take whichever one you want."
2, 31, Bender, "Oh, boy! I feel like a car in a candy store!"
2, 31, Fry, "Yes! He chose me! He's trying to kill me! Leela, I'm so happy!   Oh, thanks, Bender.   Too tight! Too tight!"
2, 31, Leela, "Whoa!"
2, 31, Bender, "Uh-oh."
2, 31, Leela, "Bender, you're cured! But what happened to Fry?"
2, 31, Bender, "I must've killed him. He's my best friend and I killed him. I never felt so empty inside."
2, 31, Fry, "Bender, I'm alive!  You didn't hurt me at all. But I know you wanted to, and that's what matters.  Here's to you."
2, 31, Bender, "Hey, that's my last beer, you bastard. I'll kill you!"
2, 31, Fry, "I'll kill you too, buddy. I'll kill you too!"
2, 32, Fry, "Giant Space Robot, this is Captain Fry of the USS Planet Express Ship. We come in peace."
2, 32, Bender, "Tough luck!"
2, 32, Fry, "Well, we destroyed the toy spaceship. Now what are we gonna do?"
2, 32, Bender, "Hey, look! The keys to the real spaceship."
2, 32, Fry, "Do you think we should?"
2, 32, Bender, "Yes, I do."
2, 32, Farnsworth, "Leela, have you seen the keys to the spaceship?"
2, 32, Leela, "I must've left them onboard."
2, 32, Farnsworth, "Eh, wha? I mean, what?"
2, 32, Leela, "Relax. The ship's not going anywhere. I anchored it with the unbreakable diamond tether."
2, 32, Amy, "Oh, no!"
2, 32, Hermes, "Sweet ghost of Babylon."
2, 32, Zoidberg, "This isn't good for Zoidberg!"
2, 32, Fry, "Woo, yeah!"
2, 32, Bender, "Woo-hoo!"
2, 32, Bender, "Hey, Fry, I'm steering with my ass!"
2, 32, Fry, "That's the best thing I ever saw!"
2, 32, Italian #1, "You stink!"
2, 32, Italian #1, "Alright, yeah!"
2, 32, Italian #2, "We like you a lot!"
2, 32, Fry, "That was great!"
2, 32, Bender, "And no one suspects a thing!  Whoa!  And that's how we learned our lesson!"
2, 32, Farnsworth, "You've gone too far this time -- all three of you!"
2, 32, Leela, "What did I do?"
2, 32, Farnsworth, "You left the keys in the ignition. I mean, look at those two. Wasn't it obvious what would happen?"
2, 32, Fry, "Yeah, Leela."
2, 32, Bender, "We're all very disappointed in you."
2, 32, Farnsworth, "I should fire you three right now, but I'm just not that cold-hearted."
2, 32, Hermes, "You're all fired."
2, 32, Zoidberg, "Goodbye, friends. I'll miss you.  Good riddance to them. Now Zoidberg is the popular one!"
2, 32, Farnsworth, "Yes, yes! Let's all talk to Zoidberg."
2, 32, Amy, "Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, I've been thinking, do you think we could go out?"
2, 32, Farnsworth, "So, Zoidberg, what's new?"
2, 32, Hermes, "Tell me, Zoidberg"
2, 32, Zoidberg, "Oh, you know!"
2, 32, Fry, "What are we supposed to do for money?  All I've got is my frequent taffy eater's card, my first moustache ...  ... and this picture of me and my old girlfriend, Michelle, and that ski instructor she was just friends with."
2, 32, Bender, "Pardon me, brother. Care to donate to the Anti-Mugging-You Fund?  Ow!"
2, 32, Leela, "We don't need to beg, Bender. For God's sake, we're not veterans!"
2, 32, Fry, "Well, what do you suggest? A daring daylight robbery of Fort Knox on elephant-back? That's the dumbest thing I ever heard!"
2, 32, Leela, "No, we can get jobs."
2, 32, Bender, "But we just had jobs!"
2, 32, Leela, "Fortunately, I still have our old career chips."
2, 32, Fry, "Our what?"
2, 32, Leela, "Career chips.  You remember? They assign you the job you're best at.  I tried to give you one and you ran away.  It's how we met!"
2, 32, Fry, "And then what happened?"
2, 32, Leela, "Just give me your hand."
2, 32, Fry, "Ow!"
2, 32, Leela, "Baby!  Ow!"
2, 32, Leela, "I'd like to reapply for my old job"
2, 32, Ipgee, "Oh, I was hoping you would come back! I even saved your poster of a chimp expressing your distaste for Mondays."
2, 32, Leela, "Monday Monkey lives for the weekend, sir."
2, 32, Ipgee, "Just put your hand under the scanner so I can verify your career chip.  Calcutta, we have a problem."
2, 32, Leela, "Delivery boy? I must have mixed up the chips. It's a simple mi--"
2, 32, Ipgee, "Oh, here's a cryogenic counsellor! Do you like Mondays?"
2, 32, Fry, "They're OK."
2, 32, Ipgee, "Then we'll have to redecorate your office. How do you feel about it helping to be crazy to work here but not being necessary?"
2, 32, Bender, "Hey, let's see what it says about me."
2, 32, Ipgee, "Welcome aboard, sir."
2, 32, Terry, "Remember, when the tube opens, say ...  ... ""Welcome to the world of tomorrow!"""
2, 32, Fry, "Hey, I was frozen. I think I know what people wanna hear when they first wake up.  Bathroom's that way."
2, 32, Fry, "So, while you're on the Probulator, tell me what brings you to the future."
2, 32, Man, "Oh, well, I wanted to meet Shakespeare and I figured that time was cyclical."
2, 32, Fry, "Nope. Straight line.  Ah, the Probulator's done."
2, 32, Man, "That wasn't so bad."
2, 32, Fry, "Oh, wait, it hasn't started yet.  OK, it's about to start."
2, 32, Bender, "Welcome to the future, human slave.  Ah, relax, chum. I'm not really a giant fly!  I'm a horrible robot!  Kill all humans!"
2, 32, Terry, "Dear God! He's having a heart attack!"
2, 32, Bender, "Ah, they'll probably find a cure for that in the future."
2, 32, Terry, "We have a cure for it now!"
2, 32, Bender, "Oh, good. Then you won't mind if I use this."
2, 32, Fry, "Nothing like a power nap."
2, 32, Old Man, "Oh, flies! Flies and gorillas!"
2, 32, Bender, "Stay beautiful, doll-face!  That Probulator sure knows how to please a man. So, what's for lunch?"
2, 32, Fry, "I ordered a pizza."
2, 32, Leela, "Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener.  Yeah, very funny. Now cough up the $12.95."
2, 32, Fry, "Sorry, but if it's not here in half an hour, it's free."
2, 32, Leela, "It's only been 23 minutes."
2, 32, Fry, "Well, uh, I've got 33 minutes."
2, 32, Chef, "It's only been a-23 minutes, you dumb a-cannoli. You got a problem, we can take it outside."
2, 32, Fry, "OK, I'll fight the box. I think I can take him."
2, 32, Leela, "Fry, just pay me. I still owe 30 bucks on this uniform."
2, 32, Chef, "35, you stupid meatball."
2, 32, Bender, "Who should be unfreeze next?"
2, 32, Fry, "No.  No!  Oh, my God! It's Pauly Shore!"
2, 32, Bender, "Alright!"
2, 32, Fry, "Mr. Shore, I loved you in Bio-Dome. You sure caused some trouble in that bubble!"
2, 32, Shore, "Rest assured, if it rhymes, I can cause trouble in it."
2, 32, Fry, "Hey, now that you're in the future, you can go live in an actual bio-dome!"
2, 32, Shore, "An unattractive prospect. While researching for the role, I ran computer simulations demonstrating, incontrovertibly, that the whole bio-enclosure concept is fundamentally flawed. Be it expressed via dome, sphere, cube or even a stately tetrahedron, buddy!"
2, 32, Fry, "Oh.  So, how did you wind up getting frozen?"
2, 32, Shore, "Well, while filming Encino Man my intellectual curiosity re"
2, 32, Fry, "The weasel?"
2, 32, Shore, "Hey, listen, skippy. I was supposed to be unfrozen in Hollywood for the thousandth anniversary screening of Jury Duty II. How come I'm not there?"
2, 32, Fry, "I woke you up early so we could hang out and do stuff."
2, 32, Shore, "Like what?"
2, 32, Fry, "I love this job."
2, 32, Bender, "Me too."
2, 32, Fry, "Showtime!  I'll pretend to be dying of space plague."
2, 32, Bender, "Boo?"
2, 32, Fry, "Michelle!"
2, 32, Bender, "Oh, my God!"
2, 32, Michelle, "Fry? Is it really you?"
2, 32, Fry, "I don't know. Is it really you?"
2, 32, Michelle, "What do you mean you don't know? Are you you or not?"
2, 32, Fry, "Who wants to know?"
2, 32, Michelle, "Oh, Fry, it is you!"
2, 32, Fry, "I don't get it, Michelle. The last time I saw you, you were doing great. You had just dumped me and you were well on your way to getting you life back on track. Why'd you freeze yourself?"
2, 32, Michelle, "Oh, Fry. After you left, things took a turn for the worse. I got married."
2, 32, Fry, "I'm sorry."
2, 32, Michelle, "His name was Charles. He attended a law school so prestigious the basketball team was coached by Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  I put him through law school by working as a dog walker for antisocial dogs."
2, 32, Fry, "Sorry."
2, 32, Michelle, "But soon after Charles graduated, our marriage ran into difficulties."
2, 32, Fry, "Uh, sorry."
2, 32, Michelle, "Desperately depressed, I turned to the one thing that could lessen my pain"
2, 32, Fry, "Sorry."
2, 32, Michelle, "But it did give me a chance to think..."
2, 32, Fry, "I'm sorry."
2, 32, Michelle, "And I remembered the last time I was truly happy; when I was with you."
2, 32, Fry, "Aww. So you froze yourself to come look for me?"
2, 32, Michelle, "No, I did it to get a fresh start. I didn't know what had happened to you -- no one did. The police were going to conduct a search but your parents felt it was a waste of taxpayer money."
2, 32, Fry, "That's the same reason they kept me out of school. So, no one even cared that I was gone?"
2, 32, Michelle, "Not really. Except for one person."
2, 32, Fry, "Who was it?"
2, 32, Michelle, "Everything is so different."
2, 32, Fry, "Not everything. There's still a roach problem."
2, 32, Michelle, "Ew!"
2, 32, Michelle, "Eurgh."
2, 32, Fry, "Nowadays, people aren't interested in art that's not tattooed on fat guys."
2, 32, Sal, "I'm on loan from the Louvre."
2, 32, Leela, "Please, Professor. Give us our jobs back. We deserve another chance."
2, 32, Bender, "Yeah, and if you won't give me another chance, perhaps you'd give one to ...  ... Og, gorilla emperor of Earth!"
2, 32, Farnsworth, "I'm sorry, Og, but I've got a new crew."
2, 32, Farnsworth, "So, how was delivery to Fantasy Planet, where everyone's fantasies come to life?"
2, 32, Amy, "Great!"
2, 32, Hermes, "Organised!"
2, 32, Zoidberg, "For one beautiful night, I knew what it was to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honoured."
2, 32, Farnsworth, "You see, Og? Everything's running smoothly, yes. And with Fry fired, I can finally leave my jigsaw puzzles out without him eating the pieces."
2, 32, Leela, "Forget about Fry. You can hire us back and he'd never have to know."
2, 32, Fry, "Hey, guys."
2, 32, Leela, "Oh, uh, hey, Fry!"
2, 32, Bender, "So, as Leela was saying, Fry can go shove a big, old-- Ow!"
2, 32, Fry, "I'm glad you're all here. I wanted to introduce you to my on-again-off-again girlfriend of the past thousand years, Michelle.  Michelle, this is Leela.  This is Bender.  The Professor.  Hermes and Amy."
2, 32, Michelle, "Nice to meet you."
2, 32, Fry, "And this is Dr. Zoidberg."
2, 32, Hermes, "Dating you ex, Fry? Have you lost all self-respect?"
2, 32, Fry, "All what?"
2, 32, Farnsworth, "This can only end badly, Fry. Kids, a house--"
2, 32, Bender, "A home invasion by a former roommate."
2, 32, Fry, "But things are different this time. Before, she was demanding and possessive. But now she wants me to do stuff and stay with her all the time."
2, 32, Zoidberg, "There you go, dearies."
2, 32, Michelle, "It's a relief to meet you, Amy. I'm just having a hard time adjusting to all the strange stuff here in the future."
2, 32, Amy, "I'm from Mars."
2, 32, Michelle, "I feel so out of place here. I don't understand why Fry fits in so well."
2, 32, Leela, "Probably because he didn't fit in back in your time."
2, 32, Michelle, "That's true. But I used to fit in really well."
2, 32, Zoidberg, "Then good luck, sister."
2, 32, Michelle, "Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but your friends are a bunch of freaks."
2, 32, Fry, "Yeah, they're great, huh?"
2, 32, Michelle, "I just don't belong here. I don't know anyone, I can't find a vanishing cream that doesn't make me actually vanish. I don't even have a job."
2, 32, Fry, "Oh, right. I was supposed to assign you a job. Let me just get your career chip installed.  Hold out your palm.  What are you scared of? It's just like getting your hand pierced."
2, 32, Michelle, "This world is horrible. Let's start over, Fry. We'll go someplace where all we have is each other."
2, 32, Fry, "Ooh, romantic. I'll tell Bender to meet us there."
2, 32, Michelle, "It's not a ""there"". It's a ""then"".  The future."
2, 32, Fry, "Whoa, whoa, girl. I thought you were talking about one of those motels where the bed is shaped like stuff."
2, 32, Michelle, "I love you. Don't you love me?"
2, 32, Fry, "Well, sure. To the extent a man can love a woman. But this seems like a big step."
2, 32, Michelle, "Fry, why must you analyse everything with your relentless logic? Nothing matters but our love."
2, 32, Fry, "You're right. Let's do this now and let's never regret it."
2, 32, Fry, "Michelle, I don't regret this. But I both rue and lament it."
2, 32, Fry, "The year 4000 is severely disappointing. I miss the year 3000 when life was simple and brains flew through space and everyone ate lasers."
2, 32, Michelle, "It's not that bad. Fate brought us together and now fate brought us here."
2, 32, Fry, "No, you brought us here."
2, 32, Michelle, "Whine some more, Fry, I really find that attractive in a man. Now come on, build us a shelter."
2, 32, Fry, "Alright, fine. Everything else sucks. At least we can have a nice place to live."
2, 32, Fry, "There!"
2, 32, Michelle, "You expect me to live in a tiny little hole?"
2, 32, Fry, "It'd be deeper, but I'm standing on a gopher."
2, 32, Michelle, "Oh, look! Some little kids."
2, 32, Fry, "They'll save us.  We're saved!"
2, 32, Butch, "I'm Butch, leader of this place. I took your hole and you can't do nothing about it."
2, 32, Michelle, "OK."
2, 32, Fry, "Mighty sir, we have nowhere to go. Could we please join your society?"
2, 32, Butch, "Well, alright. But no interfering with our grand works."
2, 32, Fry, "I tell you, that Butch runs a pretty good civilisation. I think I'll enjoy serving under him."
2, 32, Michelle, "You know your problem, Fry? You're not ambitious. You should be chief."
2, 32, Fry, "What do I need, ulcers?"
2, 32, Michelle, "But I want power. I'm tired of the chief's girlfriend lording it over me with her fancy coyote hide."
2, 32, Fry, "Alright, alright. If it'll make you happy, I'll overthrow society."
2, 32, Butch, "On what grounds do you challenge my authority?"
2, 32, Fry, "Well, I'm older than you. I can beat you up."
2, 32, Kid #1, "Yeah, I'll bet he could."
2, 32, Butch's Girlfriend, "He's got arm hair."
2, 32, Butch, "Alright, grandpa. There's only one way to settle this"
2, 32, Fry, "What's death rolling?"
2, 32, Orowheat, "It's like skateboarding."
2, 32, Ice-V, "Except half the time, someone dies."
2, 32, Fry, "Oh, so it's a little safer than skateboarding."
2, 32, Butch, "Last one holding the bandana's the new leader."
2, 32, Michelle, "My mother always said you were a loser, Fry. Now get out there and prove her wrong."
2, 32, Fry, "Beth said that?"
2, 32, Butch's Girlfriend, "Achat, shtayim, shalosh!"
2, 32, Butch, "It's cool. Back off!   My knee. I scraped it!"
2, 32, Fry, "Aww. Poor little guy. Let me just take a look at-- Aha!  I won! I'm the new chief! I'm the tallest and I weigh the most!"
2, 32, Butch, "Hand it over, you giant idiot."
2, 32, Butch's Girlfriend, "Hey, Butch, your mom's here."
2, 32, Butch, "Aw, man."
2, 32, Butch's Mom, "Come on, kids. You're late for Hebrew school."
2, 32, Orowheat, "I don't wanna go."
2, 32, Butch's Girlfriend, "Every Monday and Wednesday's the same thing."
2, 32, Fry, "I find this post-apocalyptic wasteland very confusing. Seriously, I'm weirded out."
2, 32, Michelle, "That's because you're a loser. You were a loser in the year 2000 and you're a loser in the year 4000."
2, 32, Fry, "Yeah, but in the year 3000, I had it all. Several friends, a low-paying job, a bed in a robot's closet. I envied no man. But you wrecked everything."
2, 32, Michelle, "Quit standing up for yourself, Fry. When we get back to the hole we are going to have a long, boring talk about our relationship!"
2, 32, Fry, "Oh, yeah? Well, listen to this"
2, 32, Fry, "There must be people somewhere."
2, 32, Fry, "Yes! Footprints! And hand prints?  But? What's happening?"
2, 32, Leela, "Fry, thank God we found you."
2, 32, Fry, "Leela? What are you guys doing here in the year 4000?"
2, 32, Leela, "It's not the year 4000."
2, 32, Bender, "You were only frozen for two days. Uh, by the way, I broke your bed."
2, 32, Farnsworth, "You were in Pauly Shore's tube and they were delivering it to his movie screening."
2, 32, Leela, "But, when they noticed you weren't him, they chucked you in a ditch."
2, 32, Fry, "So you're saying these aren't the decaying ruins of New York in the year 4000?"
2, 32, Farnsworth, "You wish! You're in Los Angeles!"
2, 32, Fry, "But there was this gang of 10-year-olds with guns."
2, 32, Leela, "Exactly, you're in L.A."
2, 32, Fry, "But everyone is driving around in cars shooting at each other."
2, 32, Bender, "That's L.A. for you."
2, 32, Fry, "But the air is green and there's no sign of civilisation whatsoever."
2, 32, Bender, "He just won't stop with the social commentary."
2, 32, Fry, "And the people are all phoneys. No one reads. Everything has cilantro on it--  Michelle, baby!"
2, 32, Michelle, "It's not working out, Fry."
2, 32, Shore, "Tis better to have loved and lost, n'est ce-pas?"
2, 32, Fry, "That's it. I've had it with women. From now on, I'm concentrating on my career. Can I have my old job back?"
2, 32, Farnsworth, "Why, I've forgotten why I even fired you."
2, 32, Bender, "'Cause he destroyed your business, your home and all your possessions."
2, 32, Farnsworth, "Oh, that's right. Get lost!"
