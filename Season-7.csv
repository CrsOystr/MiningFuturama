7, 115, Farnsworth, Planet Express crew, report to headquarters immediately! Repeat
7, 115, Amy, Sorry, Randy.  Step away from the car and no one gets hurt!
7, 115, Zoidberg, To the employment cave!
7, 115, Hermes, Thanks, dear. Off to work.
7, 115, Scruffy, Hyah! Hyah!
7, 115, Scruffy, Ho! Hold it, girl!  G'on now. Gid on back ta Paraguay.
7, 115, Fry, We're bein' eaten by a giant spider!
7, 115, Leela, There's no time for that! The Professor needs us!
7, 115, Farnsworth, Ih, crew,  as you know, I've delivered a lot of good news in the past. But what I'm about to lay down is, by far, the greatest announcement in the history of Planet Express!
7, 115, Fry, What is it? I'm on the edge of my butt!
7, 115, Farnsworth, Ladies and gentlemen,  feast your eyes on our amazing new...  soda machine!
7, 115, Zoidberg, You undersold it, Professor!
7, 115, Fry, Look, it has Slurm Loco! It's the extremeiest!
7, 115, Soda Machine, Hey, what can I get y'all?
7, 115, Fry, Wow! You can talk?  Shut up and give me a Slurm Loco!
7, 115, Bender, Ooh ooh! Hey, drink machine, what kind of alcoholic sodas you got?
7, 115, Soda Machine, Y'all can't drink at work! This ain't a saw mill!
7, 115, Bender, No alcohol?! Pfft, an' you got the nerve to call yourself a beverage machine?!
7, 115, Soda machine, I call myself "Bev". An' if you're lookin' for a smelly ol' can o' booze, go look in the mirror!
7, 115, Fry, Oh, snap!
7, 115, Bender, Wooooh—
7, 115, Hermes, No, now, everybody, calm down.
7, 115, Fry, Yeah, I need one more Slurm.  And one more to wash that Slurm taste outta my mouth.
7, 115, Fry, So I went to the bathroom an' my pee was green.  Pretty neat, huh?
7, 115, Hermes, I was wondering who Shrek'd in the toilet.
7, 115, Bender, I hope you're proud o' yourself, Bev!  You've turned this perfectly worthless loser into an addict!
7, 115, Bev, Cut me some slack, preacher!  I'm just a cold grinder's daughter tryin' ta stay off the pole.
7, 115, Bender, With that big ol' caboose, it'd hafta be a telephone pole!  Hey-Yo!
7, 115, Bev, Well, I guess a fella's gotta talk big when he's sportin' a little shriveled-up antenna like that.
7, 115, Bender, What?! You—ih—For your information, "madam", it's a grower, not a show-er!
7, 115, Bender, My antenna's fine! It's just fine! Ladies can't get enough Bender!
7, 115, Esther, I need to loosen up. Gimme a screwdriver.
7, 115, Bender, Helloooooo! Who's your half-dumb friend?
7, 115, Ruth and Esther, Me.
7, 115, Bender, Sure, why not?
7, 115, Esther, Hang on. It's too bright in here. Call me old-fashioned, but I like a little romance in an orgy.
7, 115, Ruth, Let's switch off this weird light.
7, 115, Fry, Yow!
7, 115, Bender, Fry, it's two a.m.!  What're ya doin' here glowin' on my skanks?
7, 115, Fry, Just sittin' here turnin' quarters into urine.
7, 115, Ruth, We don't gotta put up with this! We got polyside degrees.
7, 115, Bender, Woah woah woah! Hang on!  I'll just politely escort him in the gutter!
7, 115, Bender, Scram, shiny!
7, 115, Bender, All right! How we feelin'?
7, 115, Ruth, Hot. I could bake a potato in my cleavage.
7, 115, Esther, Yeah, I need a seltzer.
7, 115, Bender, I'd be honored to purchase you some refreshment.  Uh, hey, drink machine, ya got anything classy for these delicate flowers?
7, 115, Bev, I ain't makin' drinks for no trashy robosluts!
7, 115, Esther, Trashy? At least I don't put out for quarters!
7, 115, Esther, Hey!
7, 115, Bender, Hey! Stop that...drink machine! Stop it, I say!
7, 115, Esther, That's it! We're outta here!
7, 115, Ruth, C'mon. We'll split a blintz.
7, 115, Bender, Wait! Gimme a chance to defend your honor. And then sell it to you on the couch!
7, 115, Bender, All right. I've been waitin' all day for an excuse to hit a lady!
7, 115, Bev, You try it and I'll bash yo' face in!
7, 115, Bender, Ooh! I'm so scared...no-arms!
7, 115, Bev, Want some of this?
7, 115, Bender, Interesting!
7, 115, Leela, Uh, Fry, you're glowing like the Human Torch on prom night.
7, 115, Amy, Shouldn't you be standing on a rocky coast somewhere preventing shipwrecks?
7, 115, Fry, Nice! Hate me because of the brightness of my skin!
7, 115, Fry, You okay, ma'am? I think your soda water broke.
7, 115, Fry, My God! Bev just had a baby in my cup!
7, 115, Fry, I know, right?
7, 115, Leela, I better take that.  Aw, he's so cute.   Wait, no he isn't.
7, 115, Leela (cont'd), He looks like Bender!
7, 115, Bender, Oh, no no no! No way am I that kid's dad!
7, 115, Baby, Wipe my tiny metal ass!
7, 115, Bender, Ah, crap.
7, 115, Baby, Mama, thirsty!
7, 115, Bev, Hang on, dumplin'. My milk's comin' in.
7, 115, Zoidberg, Uch! In public?!
7, 115, Bender, Ah, biscuits! I'm a father?! How did this happen?!!
7, 115, Bev, Does this ring a bell?
7, 115, Bender, Are you tellin' me the stuff we did in private and also twice on the sidewalk made a baby robot? How?!
7, 115, Amy, Aw, Bender, didn't your mom ever tell you where robot babies come from?
7, 115, Bender, No. She was a religious fundamentalist. Plus she didn't have a mouth. It's an unusual combination.
7, 115, Farnsworth, Come on, everyone. Let's take Bender to the teen center to learn about the bots and the bees.
7, 115, Leela, It's okay, Bender. No one here will laugh at you for not knowing where robot babies come from.
7, 115, Tinny Tim, We don't know, either.
7, 115, Farnsworth, [holding a videocasette labelled "ROBOT SEX ED
7, 115, Narrator, SEX ED. VOLUME ONE or PANTS FULL of SHAME!
7, 115, Narrator, Meet Gerald, a maturing young robot.
7, 115, Spotty Teen Robot, Hey, he looks like me!
7, 115, Narrator, His hideous appearance is a byproduct of his hardware gearing up for an important mission
7, 115, Fat-bot, Oh boy oh boy oh boy!
7, 115, Narrator, Since factories can't manufacture enough robots to meet demand, robots can also reproduce by mating.
7, 115, Bender, Aw, now you tell me!
7, 115, Narrator, First, Gerald must find a female robot. The best he can do is Francine.
7, 115, Narrator, After beer and hot wings at a local gas station, the two enjoy intimate time behind a dumpster. It's all perfectly natural. Let's watch, aroused, as Gerald's antenna uploads a binary file to Francine's internal drive.
7, 115, Narrator, Manufacturing specs from each parent are then merged by a randomized algorithm and the resulting code guides assembly of a new robot.  Yes, everything your body does is perfectly natural.
7, 115, Narrator, Except masturbation! That's...just...wrong!!!
7, 115, Bender, Daaaw, I can't believe I made a kid! I'm not ready! There's so much in the world I haven't stolen yet!
7, 115, Leela, Relax, Bender. No one would let you near a child. Bev will get custody and you'll be a deadbeat dad who never even bothers to know his own son.
7, 115, Bender, You really think so?
7, 115, Leela, I know so. You're absolutely horrible in every way.
7, 115, Bender, You're sweet, Leela.
7, 115, Bender, Sorry, Bev, but I ain't cut out for fatherhood.  So here's my certificate of abandonment drawn up by our notary.
7, 115, Scruffy, That'll be ten bucks.
7, 115, Bender, Now take your kid an' hit the soup line!
7, 115, Bev, Oh, no, you don't, mister! Damn baby's drivin' me crazy!  He won't stop giggling no matter how much I scream at 'im!
7, 115, Fry, There, there.
7, 115, Bev, I still got womanly needs! Who's gonna look twice at me with this dirty leash hangin' off my dairy nozzle?
7, 115, Bender, Well, not me, that's for sure!
7, 115, Bev, Then it's settled!  He's all yours, pappy!
7, 115, Bender, Hey, wait! You can't le— Wha?
7, 115, Bender, What th—?! Ah, can't I have one moment to myself?!!
7, 115, Bender, Why can't you sleep?
7, 115, Fry, I left my window open and moths got in.
7, 115, Bender, I swear if I wasn't such a great dad, I'd grab his ugly little neck and—
7, 115, Bender, Hey, he stopped screamin' for a second.
7, 115, Fry, Bend some other stuff!
7, 115, Bender's Son, Bend! Bend!
7, 115, Bender, He loves bending! Just like me!  Aw!  I'm gonna call 'im Ben.  After the first half of me, Bender!  That's my bastard!
7, 115, Bender, Uh-oh.
7, 115, Ben, Bend it, daddy!  Bend it like it called you poo-poo face!
7, 115, Bender, It called me what?!?  Ooooh!  God damn!
7, 115, Ben, Yay!  You bended it like a p'etzel!
7, 115, Bender, Okay.  Now, you.
7, 115, Ben, I can't do it!
7, 115, Bender, Eh, buddy.  You're learnin'.  You'll get there.
7, 115, Leela, Bender, I was wrong.  You're a fine parent and I want to apologi—
7, 115, Bender and Ben, Leela was wrong!  Leela was wrong!
7, 115, Ben, Daddy, how'd you get so good at bending?
7, 115, Bender, I inherited my arm-control software from my mom.  That's how it's passed down.  Mother to son.
7, 115, Ben, But...my mommy had no arms.  Does that mean I can never be a bender?
7, 115, Bender, Well, sure you can.  You just need to get a bending card installed.
7, 115, Farnsworth, I hate to crush a boy's dreams, but...    What the heck!    He has only one expansion slot and it holds his memory card.  This Robot will never bend!
7, 115, Bender, Don't tell my son what he can an' can't do!  You may know what's in his head,  but you don't know what's in his heart!
7, 115, Farnsworth, There's no slot in there either.
7, 115, Bender, I said "shut up"!
7, 115, Reverend Preacherbot, Today marks young Ben's thirteenth day of bein' left on contin-yussly! So, b'fo the lawd at this congregation, we upgrade him to manhoodbot! Can I get a "mazl tov"?
7, 115, Leela, Bender, Hermes, Farnsworth, Amy and Zoidberg, Mazl tov!
7, 115, Fry, Mazl tov!
7, 115, Ben, I'd like to thank the Preacherbot for the introduction and also for not circumcising me again. Am I right?  Twice was enough. But seriously, today, I'm not just a manbot, I'm the luckiest manbot alive. My mom may have abandoned me, but I have the greatest dad in the whole universe. He's patient, he's not afraid to show his emotions....
7, 115, Bender, Don't look at me!
7, 115, Ben, ...and someday, if my dreams come true, I'll be a bender, just like him.
7, 115, Hermes, You must be so proud of your boy.
7, 115, Bender, I can take 'im or leave 'im.
7, 115, Bev, I'm back for my son! I've come to take him and leave with him!
7, 115, Hermes, She beat you to both things!
7, 115, Bev, It's okay, son. Mama's here now.
7, 115, Ben, Daddy, don't let 'er take me!
7, 115, Bender, Get your lack o' hands off my boy! You're an unfit parent who abandoned her child!
7, 115, Bev, Oh, yeah? Well, I'm still less unfitter than you!
7, 115, Bender, Sez hoo?!
7, 115, Bev, Sez this document you gave me when you tried to abandon Ben first.
7, 115, Scruffy, It's genuine.
7, 115, Bender, That doesn't prove I'm an unfit parent! I was drunk and violent when I signed that!
7, 115, Bev, Well, I'm drunk and violent now! He's comin' with me!
7, 115, Ben, DADDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!
7, 115, Bender, SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!!!
7, 115, Bender, My boy's gone! All I have left to remember him are these innocent playthings we stole together.  Fry, put these someplace safe.
7, 115, Hermes, That's it, Fry! For a guy who's not too bright, you're too damn bright!
7, 115, Farnsworth, Now get out!! And don't come back until someone finds a use for a million watt idiot!
7, 115, Ben, Mom, will I ever get to see Dad again?
7, 115, Bev, No, he died yesterday. Rust monsters ate his face. Sweet dreams.
7, 115, Bender, Psst, quit whimperin' or ya don't get kidnapped!
7, 115, Ben, Dad!
7, 115, Bender, Come on! Let's run for it!
7, 115, Ben, What's gonna happen to us now, Dad?
7, 115, Bender, Well, I reckon we'll just sit around this campfire a while.
7, 115, Ben, But then what?
7, 115, Bender, Only a fool plans more than a few centuries ahead, son.
7, 115, URL, Freeze, camp woodsmen!
7, 115, Smitty, You're under arrest for kidnapping and burning raccoons without a permit!
7, 115, Ben, It's over, Dad!
7, 115, Bender, It ain't over! I can't outrun a hovercopter, but I can outbend it!
7, 115, Bender, I know, let's outrun it!  There's a dam!
7, 115, Ben, Damn!
7, 115, Bender, There's a grate!
7, 115, Ben, Great!
7, 115, Bender, But I can't bend anything with my arms agonizingly maimed like this!
7, 115, Ben, Well, maybe I can!
7, 115, Bender, You can do it, son!
7, 115, URL, Yeah, this ain't gon' happen.
7, 115, Bender, Is that even necessary?
7, 115, Ben, I'm sorry, Daddy.
7, 115, Bender, You got nothin' to be sorry about.
7, 115, Leela, He's really a very good father.
7, 115, URL, Alright. I got her statement.  And a straight-up grape soda.  Aw, yeah.
7, 115, Bev, I promise things'll be different, son. From now on, I'm chainin' you to a radiator!
7, 115, Leela, I'm amazed someone who dispenses such warm soda could be so cold-hearted!  I'm gonna buy a drink just so I can throw it in your face!  It's another soda baby!
7, 115, URL, Damn!
7, 115, Leela, You got knocked up by a police officer while he was looking for your kidnapped child?!
7, 115, Bev, Sure did! I still got it!
7, 115, Bender, So now what happens?
7, 115, Bev, Tell you what, you keep the big one. Long as I got a baby to neglect, I'm happy.
7, 115, Leela, Should we call child services?
7, 115, URL, Naw, let's get outta here.
7, 115, Bender, WOOOOOO-OOOO!  WOOO! WOO-HOO-HOO!  Woo?
7, 115, Ben, Sorry, Dad. I'm glad to be back. I'm just kinda bummed I can't bend stuff. All I ever wanted was to go to Bending State, Santa Cruz. But that's never gonna happen.
7, 115, Bender, Listen, you need somethin' bent, you come to me, huh, champ?
7, 115, Bender, Dammit! I love that little guy so much! I'd sacrifice any four of you if it would help him bend even a little!
7, 115, Farnsworth, There is one way!  Eh, but, no. It's too horrible!
7, 115, Bender, Nothing's too horrible for my boy!
7, 115, Farnsworth, Well, I could install a bending card.
7, 115, Bender, But you said he only has one slot!
7, 115, Farnsworth, Correct! I'd have to remove his memory card! He'd be able to bend, but he'd lose all his memories! He wouldn't even remember who you are!
7, 115, Bender, You sure you wanna be a bender, son?
7, 115, Ben, More than anything.
7, 115, Bender, Just remember, your daddy loves you. Remember that, will you, son? Remember that!
7, 115, Ben, Dad, are you crying?
7, 115, Bender, "No," I said with the mouth you're lookin' at.
7, 115, Bender, You sure take after your old man.
7, 115, Ben, I never knew my father.
7, 115, Bender, Ooooh, it's not important. What is important is that we get you to Bending State Santa Cruz in time for registration!
7, 115, Zoidberg, Then we better hurry!  Registration ends in one hour!
7, 115, Bender, To the ship!
7, 115, Leela, It's too foggy! We can't navigate through this storm! Our lights aren't bright enough.
7, 115, Bender, I'm sorry I let you down, son.
7, 115, Ben, Who are you again?
7, 115, Bender, It's just not possible to get you to bending school this year.
7, 115, Fry, Or is there?!
7, 115, Fry, Merry College Registration Day, everyone!
7, 116, Leela, A lot of weather we're having.
7, 116, Fry, Allow me, m'lady.  Shall we go a-trousering?
7, 116, Leela, Fry, I appreciate the gallantry, but isn't this a bit much?
7, 116, Fry, You're right. I'm sorry for showing my love.
7, 116, Leela, Okay. Fine.
7, 116, Fry, Here, take my hand!
7, 116, Farnsworth, News and weather, everyone. I'm sure you've all noticed the bizarre atmospheric conditions of late.
7, 116, Hermes, Come to mention it, yes.
7, 116, Farnsworth, It seems something ain't right in the magnetosphere, so I'm launching this high-altitude weather balloon to gather more data.
7, 116, Fry, My pants! My lucky pants!
7, 116, Hermes, They don't look so lucky to me.
7, 116, Fry, They are too! I was wearing them that time I found a dime in my ear! It was wearing them when I won a subscription to Redbook! And I was wearing them when I first met Leela, so, yeah, they're lucky!
7, 116, Leela, Aw...also, oh, Lord.
7, 116, Fry, Plus, they're my only pants.
7, 116, Bender, You've worn the same pants for a thousand years? No wonder they made a run for it!  Woo!
7, 116, Farnsworth, Soon your trousers will slip the surly bonds of Earth, and ascend to the heavens!
7, 116, Fry, I'm gonna blast that balloon!  No way will I let God get my pants!  Nobody messes with my pants. Not even the Holy One. Blessed be He.
7, 116, Hermes, Look out! A Central Park badger!
7, 116, Fry, I'll save you, pants! Scruffy, do you have any varmint grease?
7, 116, Scruffy, What viscosity you need?
7, 116, Fry, Woah, there's writing in here!  Also, this grease is flammable!
7, 116, Farnsworth, Incredible! Who could have done this? The sewer mutants?
7, 116, Leela, No, this isn't mutant language. We use a lot more profanity.  Son of a bi–!
7, 116, Fry, Leela! Take my hand!
7, 116, Leela, I'm slipping! The one time your hands aren't sticky, they're greasy!
7, 116, Fry, I'm sorry. Normally, I would have wiped them on my pants, but–
7, 116, Fry, Are you okay?
7, 116, Leela, I–ow! My leg! It's broken! How'd you get down here?
7, 116, Fry, We made a rope from my shirt and jacket.  And an expedition flag from my underpants!  I'll help you up. Here, take my hand.
7, 116, Leela, Stop telling me to take your hand! Look, Fry, your noble things keep making things worse. Can't you just be a rude, unhelpful jerk like Bender?
7, 116, Bender, When I use up the toilet paper I don't put up a new roll!
7, 116, Zoidberg, Fry, my friend, I found your pants!  And no sign of that crafty badger!
7, 116, Fry, All right! Lucky pants!
7, 116, Amy, Oh my God! Look what my flashlight found!
7, 116, Zoidberg, A giant pyramid under New New York? What badger could have built this?
7, 116, Farnsworth, And look at this intricately carved disk! It merits years of study. But how can we move such a fragile, precious–
7, 116, Bender, Ancient history coming through!
7, 116, Farnsworth, Amazing! It appears to be some kind of extremely ancient calendar! Predating even the girls of Sumeria! Of course! It's a Mayan calendar!  No...wait! There's some dried-up old stew on the screen.Scruffy
7, 116, Scruffy, Sorry. I was eating a can of breakfast and looking at porn.
7, 116, Amy, It's not Mayan, it's Martian!
7, 116, Leela, Amy, you grew up on Mars, right? Can you read Martian?
7, 116, Amy, A little. I only learned enough to yell at my nanny. Let's see...  I think it means..."The sun will erupt...all shall perish. Blah, blah, blah."
7, 116, Bender, Get to the point! What does it say about me, Bender?
7, 116, Amy, Nothing! But it does say a great cataclysm will destroy the world in the year thirty twelve!
7, 116, Bender, The world? That's where I live! Told you it'd say something about me!
7, 116, Fry, So the world will end in three thousand twelve. Why does that year sound so familiar?
7, 116, Farnsworth, Because that's the year that's this year! See?
7, 116, Scruffy, So, uh...are you all done with the computer?
7, 116, Hermes, Is it just me - or is the world endin' more often these days?
7, 116, Amy, The calendar predicts fires, earthquakes, sharksplosions...  Then, it just ends!
7, 116, Farnsworth, Exactly as the weather balloon foretold! Before Fry blew his pants outta the sky, it detected the onset of a catastrophic sunspot cycle.  It's starting!  This is the end of the world!
7, 116, Superhero from The Beast with the Billion Backs, Cowardman, away!
7, 116, Nine, Some of us were crazy before it was cool.
7, 116, Leela, Evacuating the planet in 3...2...
7, 116, Farnsworth, So long, Earth! Thanks for nothing!
7, 116, Leela, It's not starting!
7, 116, Sal, Come on...comes on!
7, 116, Nixon, Oh, let me try, headless clone of Agnew!  Damn thing just won't turn over. It's like Pat on a Sunday morning!
7, 116, Farnsworth, Oh, the Marconi is on the fritz too! The electromagnetic storm is disabling all electronics on Earth!
7, 116, Bender, Hi, there.
7, 116, Leela, Well, it wasn't a bad life. If only I could get back that time I spent watching Tron Legacy.
7, 116, Fry, Leela, I've made up my mind. Before we die, I'm gonna find and destroy every remaining copy of Tron Legacy! It may take a couple of hours, but–
7, 116, Leela, Fry, stop trying to do things for me!  Whatever time we have left, just live it with me. So...you wanna join the balcony club?
7, 116, Zoidberg, The balcony club? I have an individual membership!
7, 116, Fry, Zoidberg, get lost!
7, 116, Zoidberg, I am lost! So long.
7, 116, Amy, Stop the end-of-the-world sex! We might survive after all!
7, 116, Farnsworth, Alright, Amy! What's so important that you interrupted my embalming?
7, 116, Amy, I translated more Martian symbols! There's a way off this planet! That underground pyramid isn't a pyramid– [Cut to
7, 116, Zoidberg, It was worth waiting five hours to hear you finish that sentence.
7, 116, Fry, A spaceship made of stone? With no electronics, it just might work!
7, 116, Bender, I'll stick with wind-up power, thank you very much!
7, 116, Leela, Hmmm...I've never flown a pyramid before. But I used to drive around town in a mausoleum!
7, 116, Hermes, How many people can this thing carry?
7, 116, Leela, Well, the mausoleum held ten horny teenagers, so...maybe thirty-thousand.
7, 116, Farnsworth, It's our moral duty to save as many lives as possible!  They had a chance! Let's go!
7, 116, Zapp, Mind if I appear?
7, 116, Nixon, Welcome to the hidey house. Brannigan! Tell me about this freaky-deaky escape pyramid!
7, 116, Zapp, I can fly it, sir! I just need to know where. And how.
7, 116, Nixon, The obvious destination is Mars.  It's close, with lots of open space and no Woodward or Bernstein! That's a plus.
7, 116, Amy, But we can only save thirty-thousand people! How do we choose who goes?
7, 116, Nixon, Well, let's see now. We'll need leaders...  scientists...  doctors...  bureaucrats...  pilots...  valuable appliances...  even janitors!  But that's it!  No one else!
7, 116, Fry, I'll miss you, Leela.  But it's okay. Because then I'll die.
7, 116, Nixon, Cut the waterworks, hippie! The final decision will be made not by me, but by a cold, logical machine!
7, 116, Announcer, Who shall live and who shall die? Step right up to the Contrabulous Choosematron!
7, 116, Fry, I hate waiting in line to die.
7, 116, Announcer, Move it along, grandma! Stick your hand in and take your chances!
7, 116, Contrabulous Choosematron, Female. Crotchety. Needed to keep others in their place. Accepted!
7, 116, Hattie, Damn straight, kajigger!
7, 116, Petunia, Ooh, me next!
7, 116, Contrabulous Choosematron, We just got one of these. Rejected!
7, 116, Contrabulous Choosematron, Male. Scientist. Fond of crazy contraptions. Accepted!
7, 116, Contrabulous Choosematron, Female. Scientist. We were in the same sorority! Accepted!
7, 116, Amy and the Contrabulous Choosematron, Sigma beta, see ya later!
7, 116, Contrabulous Choosematron, Male. Medical doctor. Delicious with butter and lemon. Accepted!
7, 116, Hermes, I wish they'd hurry. I want to get out of here before the mayhem starts!
7, 116, Bender, Mayhem? There's gonna be mayhem? I'm staying!  Woo-eee!
7, 116, Fry, Well, might as well get it over with.
7, 116, Contrabulous Choosematron, Male. Delivery boy. No discernible skills. Accepted!  'Cause I like his pants.
7, 116, Fry, Yes! My lucky pants! Leela! We can go together after all! Come on, get your badge! Take my hand!
7, 116, Contrabulous Choosematron, Top gun pilot. Natural leader. Extreme combat training. Rejected!
7, 116, Leela, What?!
7, 116, Contrabulous Choosematron, With all spaceships inoperable, we only need one spaceship pilot!
7, 116, Zapp, Wonder what this doo-cracky does.  Snake door. Roger!
7, 116, Fry, You can't reject Leela! Give her a badge, you stupid box!
7, 116, Contrabulous Choosematron, Male. Filthy hand. Violent temper. Accepted again!
7, 116, Fry, Nooo!
7, 116, Leela, Fry. The box has spoken. Go to Mars.
7, 116, Fry, Okay.  Will you at least keep this photo?  Remember how Bender dumped all that pig's blood on me?
7, 116, Leela, You keep it. I'll remember you in here.
7, 116, Fry, I wish I could remember with my boobs.
7, 116, Farnsworth, Leela! We're off to Mars!  We'll see ourselves out.
7, 116, Fry, Wait! I did it. I got a Leela a ticket!
7, 116, Leela, How did you that?!
7, 116, Fry, A-ah-uh-uh! A magician never reveals his secrets. Except the Great Reveal-o!
7, 116, Zoidberg, That guy stinks.
7, 116, Nixon, I still don't see why you get the window seat.
7, 116, Zapp, Folks, this is your captain. Our snake tanks are fully loaded.  So once I figure out which button launches this–  I figured it out!
7, 116, Bender, Boo! Don't come back! Well, let's get lootin'!
7, 116, Leela, Fry, this is the most noble thing anyone has ever done for me.  Wait! Fry?
7, 116, Nine, I'm a lot of people, but I'm not Fry!
7, 116, Leela, Oh, no!
7, 116, Leo, Welcome to Mars! It is with heavy heart and open arms that we receive Earth's only survivors! Admission
7, 116, Amy, Dad! Gleesh!
7, 116, Zapp, Greetings, Marsmen!  We come to your planet to construct a gleaming city! A second Earth on which to begin anew!
7, 116, Inez, Okay! Admission
7, 116, Leela, I can't believe it. Fry sacrificed his spot for me and I never even had a chance to thank him.
7, 116, Zoidberg, Don't worry, Leela! Earth is still there. Peaceful and serene as ever.
7, 116, Fry, Bender! You're stealing your own stuff!
7, 116, Bender, I am?  Jeez, I better slow down! I'm stealing stuff I don't even need!  You want a Torah?
7, 116, Fry, Nah, I'm not hungry.
7, 116, Bender, Aw, what's the matter? Scared of dying?
7, 116, Fry, No. 'Cause as long as Leela lives, I'll be alive too. In her heart. But really I'll be dead!
7, 116, Nixon, Ladies and gentlemen. Our new Martian city is complete! I give you...  Dick Francisco!
7, 116, Great Reveal-o, The doves didn't magically spring from my hand, but rather were crammed into this netting sewn into my sleeve!
7, 116, Zapp, Thank you, Great Reveal-o! And now, as a solemn testicle to those left behind on Earth, I present this monument, titled simply, "Heroes".
7, 116, Leela, That frightened little girl in the statue reminds me of Fry!
7, 116, Unknown person, Stop the ceremony!
7, 116, Nixon, Who is this non-Washington redskin?
7, 116, Singing Wind, I am Singing Wind. Chief of the native Martian tribe.
7, 116, Leela, But I thought your people abandoned this planet.
7, 116, Singing Wind, We did! I just came back for my stuff. What are you guys doing here?
7, 116, Farnsworth, Fleeing Earth, of course! We flew here in your great stone pyramid!
7, 116, Singing Wind, Seriously? That thing flies?
7, 116, Amy, Of course! Your people left it so we could escape! I translated your warning that the world was doomed.
7, 116, Singing Wind, Not your world. Our world! We put calendar there to warn you not to visit Mars. It Mars that gonna be destroyed!  Why you think we so eager to abandon this dump? You guys got ten, fifteen minutes max! Well, so long!
7, 116, Amy, Hey! Ancient Martian's a very hard language!   looks just like !
7, 116, Zapp, To the spaceship!
7, 116, Kif, There is no spaceship. You had it dismantled to build that statue!
7, 116, Zapp, To the statue!  Ah! Ah!
7, 116, Farnsworth, Oh, what an idiot I was! And by "I", I mean "you"!  The final solar flare is going to bypass Earth and strike Mars!
7, 116, Hermes, My God! One of the hundreds of contradictory prophecies is coming true!
7, 116, Leela, I should have known better than to trust one of Fry's romantic gestures. Every time he says he loves me, I get killed!
7, 116, Farnsworth, It's just as I only now began to fear! The solar flares are igniting subsurface gas pockets!
7, 116, Amy, Ah! Mars is being blasted out of its orbit!
7, 116, Leela, Fry! You noble idiot!
7, 116, Fry, You're right, Bender! Grave robbing is fun! And these piñas coladas are fantastic!
7, 116, Bender, The crazy weather cleared up too, for whatever reason!
7, 116, Fry, All in all, it's a fine day for an apocalypse.
7, 116, Bender, So...you don't miss whatshername?
7, 116, Fry, Of course I do.  But even though we're millions of miles apart, somehow, I feel she's near me.
7, 116, Bender, Very near!
7, 116, Hattie, Oh, no! The kajigger of Gibraltar!
7, 116, Dandy Jim, I have got to quit drinking.
7, 116, Gus, Thanks, friend!
7, 116, Fry, Another great thing was, she always had room for dessert!
7, 116, Farnsworth, We're passing surprisingly close to Earth! When we reach 72nd Street, jump!
7, 116, Zapp, Ah...cushiony!
7, 116, Amy, We made it! We're back home!
7, 116, Hermes, Okay. Today is still a work day, so–
7, 116, Leela, Wait! Help!  I'm still on Mars and I can't jump!
7, 116, Fry, Hang on, Leela! I'll save you again!
7, 116, Leela, Or somebody else could do it!
7, 116, Fry, Quick! Take my hand!
7, 116, Leela, I don't know. Bad things happen when you say that.
7, 116, Fry, I got her.
7, 116, Leela, Ow!
7, 116, Fry, Oops! Try again!
7, 116, Leela, We're too far apart!
7, 116, Fry, No, we're not! Grab your severed arm with your other arm!
7, 116, Leela, Ew...kay...
7, 116, Fry, Huraa...  ...aaah!
7, 116, Zoidberg, Good thing Scruffy rescued Leela.
7, 116, Scruffy, Don't thank me. Thank the ladder.
7, 116, Farnsworth, Your cloned arms should be fully grown in a month or so.  But for right now, enjoy the sounds of the world's smallest violin.
7, 116, Fry, I hope you're not too mad at me, Leela. For tearing your arm off and all.
7, 116, Leela, I can't be mad. I'm on way too many painkillers. Plus, you were willing to sacrifice yourself so I could live! I mean, you failed...miserably...but you're the only person who loves me enough to try.
7, 116, Fry, One last...foolish gesture?
7, 117, Bender, Free beer?!
7, 117, Bender, Free beer! Free beer! Free beer! Free beer! Free beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beeeer!  Hello. I'm here for the...free beer?
7, 117, iZac, You got it! Right after these eight-hundred people get!
7, 117, Bender, Beer beer beer beer beer.  Beer?[Cut to
7, 117, Nixon, Thank you, headless clone of Agnew. My fellow Earthicans! I am proud to announce I'm for reelection as president of Earth. The greatest planet in the world!  Is everyone enjoying their free beer?  Well, there's plenty more where that came from!
7, 117, iZac, We're all out o' beer!
7, 117, Nixon, Alright, listen up, nitwits. Who here is tired of illegal space aliens taking our good Earth jobs?  Me too! So if I'm re-elected, I promise to big a really big Dyson fence across the Southern border of our solar system.  And furthermore, by golly, I promise to cut taxes for the rich and use the poor as a cheap source of teeth for aquarium gravel!
7, 117, Fry, Yeah, that'll show those poor!
7, 117, Leela, Why are you cheering, Fry? You're not rich!
7, 117, Fry, True. But someday I might be rich, and people like me better watch their step!
7, 117, Leela, Let's just find Bender.
7, 117, Bender, Ah...that hit the spot!
7, 117, Fry, I found Bender!
7, 117, Bender, Good news, everyone!
7, 117, Farnsworth, Wha?
7, 117, Bender, I've repaired myself with these convenient "Re-Elect Nixon" ass stickers!  Go Nixon!
7, 117, Leela, Bender, you can't even vote. You're a convicted felon!
7, 117, Bender, Convicted, sentenced and executed! But Nixon passes a law that says ex-cons can vote again...as long as they vote for Nixon.
7, 117, Leela, But Nixon's the worst president in history. And alternate history! The rest of you aren't voting for him, are you?
7, 117, Fry, Sure, we are!
7, 117, Zoidberg, Why not?
7, 117, Farnsworth, Of course!
7, 117, Amy, Spluh!
7, 117, Zoidberg, He may not be perfect, but do we really want some unknown new guy? I'll stick with the evil maniac I know, thank you.
7, 117, Leela, Well, I think we can do better. This year, I'm going to get involved in the political process and make my voice heard.
7, 117, Farnsworth, What?
7, 117, Morbo, Welcome to debate 3012, the 3,012th debate of the 3012 election year.  We have a crowded field of candidates, so I will dispense with the informal terrorising and begin the questions.[Cut to
7, 117, Leela, Is this the political process? 'Cause I'm here to get involved in it.
7, 117, Morbo, Silence!  Question one. Will you pledge today to somehow reduce taxes while simultaneously lowering the deficit.
7, 117, Candidate 1, Hey, that's a good idea! Sure.
7, 117, Candidate 2, If it'll win me the election, then yes.
7, 117, Candidate 3, We have a saying up in Alaska.  That's all.
7, 117, Morbo, Senator Travers?
7, 117, Travers, Look, let's be honest here. No one likes taxes. But they pay for our basic needs. Roads, schools, defence. If we hope to realise our aspirations as a great planet, we must each pay our fair share to achieve those noble goals.
7, 117, Morbo, Thank you, Senator. A thoughtful and lucid answer.  You will be destroyed!  Question two
7, 117, Candidate 1, No. It's junk science.
7, 117, Candidate 2, Two words
7, 117, Travers, Now, just a minute. These are important issues. We can't just reduce them to sound bites! According to reputable scientists– Candidate 5
7, 117, Candidate 5, Enviro-mite!
7, 117, Leela, Hello? I'd like to volunteer. Is anyone lurking?
7, 117, Leela, Hey, stop that.  Senator Travers? That's no way to win an election.
7, 117, Travers, I give up. No one cares about my message. I never should have used the same P.R. guy as One Hour Hot Dog!
7, 117, Travers' P.R. guy, People will wait for something good.
7, 117, Leela, No, don't quit. You have great ideas. You just need to get them out there with social media. Look, I posted your debate video on Facebag.
7, 117, Travers, 10,000 views? That's more than most water-skiing squirrels get. You really think I have a chance?
7, 117, Leela, Absolutely. We just need to conceal your intelligence and honesty in a hipper, dumber package.
7, 117, Travers, Well, what have I got to lose? I'm making you my new campaign manager.  You, out!
7, 117, Travers' P.R. guy, You haven't heard the last of m–
7, 117, Linda, Election 3012. The choosening!
7, 117, Linda, As the Iowa caucus approaches, the state's hippest citizens turned out for an old-fashioned flash mob.
7, 117, Morbo, Chris Travers got a bump in the new Hampshire polls today, where he simuldined in 250 diners at once via hologram.
7, 117, Travers, This pie at this diner is the best pie.
7, 117, Linda, Chris Travers wins the South California primary handily, thanks to a series of well-placed cameo appearances.
7, 117, Morbo, Super Tuesday is in the books, with Eurasia, Australia and Kentucky turning out in big numbers.  With the race a dead heat, it's all come down to a final tally at the convention.
7, 117, Calculon, And the first runner-up, who will take over if the nominee is caught with a dead girl, a live boy or any kind of sexy ghost...Mr. Greenland!  Which means our nominee is the senator from the nation-state of Hawaii, Chris Travers!
7, 117, Leela, He won the nomination! We the people did it!
7, 117, Hermes, It wasn't "we the people". It was you the mutant. Your insightful nagging really won us over.
7, 117, Fry, Yeah. You explained his positions in a way even an idiot could understand. And that appealed to me, for whatever reason.
7, 117, Leela, Thanks, guys, but we have a lot of work ahead of us. If we're going to win the election, we've all got to get involved.
7, 117, Fry, You said it!
7, 117, Amy, That's right.
7, 117, Bender, If you want my opinion, Nixon's only chance to defeat Travers is with filthy lies, dirty tricks and good old Quaker thuggery.  And I'm just the guy for the job.
7, 117, Nixon, I'm not sure if it's safe to talk. Are you wearing a wire?
7, 117, Bender, I'm 40% wire.
7, 117, Nixon, Excellent. Now, listen. We got to get some dirt on this Travers guy. Really McGovern him up. You know who McGovern was, right?
7, 117, Nixon, I don't even know who you are.
7, 117, Bender, Hello, dirt.  I'll start at "N" for nude pictures.  Aw, Nobel prize? That's no good. How about "A" for adultery?  What? Straight-A transcript?
7, 117, Travers, Hey, what's that rifling sound?
7, 117, Bender, Uh-oh. [Scene
7, 117, Bender, All right. I'm going to catch Travers on video at this sleazy strip club.
7, 117, Bender, In and out of the club 13 times in one night. That's a record.
7, 117, Nixon, Where's Travers? All I see is you going in and out.
7, 117, Bender, Yeah, me. I set the record.
7, 117, Nixon, This is as useless as those pictures you photoshopped. Bender
7, 117, Bender, Look, just give me one more chance. I got a source.
7, 117, Nixon, Well, you did manage to get a tremendous urine sample.
7, 117, Bender, Let's not talk about that!
7, 117, Bender, 'Is that you, big throat?
7, 117, Big Throat, In the flesh.
7, 117, Bender, Listen, I need some dirt on Senator Chris Travers.
7, 117, Hedonismbot, How quaint. But I suppose I should do my part for political intercourse. Come closer, and I'll expose what I know.  There's nothing. He's as clean as a freshly waxed buttock.
7, 117, Bender, Hey! Did you put your tongue in my ear?
7, 117, Hedonismbot, Certainly not. I don't have a tongue.
7, 117, Bender, Oh, good. 'Cause I don't have an ear.
7, 117, Nixon, Come on, come on, fall. Fall, damn it, fall!  Well? What did you get on Travers? Is he a draft dodger? Sex offender? Sex dodger?
7, 117, Bender, Nada. He's clean.  I'm sorry, but there's not one unusual thing about Senator Chris Zaxxar Travers.
7, 117, Nixon, Wait, wait. His middle name is Zaxxar? Sounds kind of alien. The voters hate aliens.
7, 117, Bender, They sure do, but this guy's as human as you or me.
7, 117, Nixon, I don't care what he is. We'll start a rumour that he's an alien.
7, 117, Bender, Hey, yeah. That'll cost him votes!
7, 117, Nixon, Then, when he says he was born on this planet, we make him cough up his Earth certificate. Keep it on the news, put him on the defensive.  Oh, this is sneaky. I feel a jowl movement coming on.
7, 117, Travers, And that's how you end hunger. Does anyone have any questions?
7, 117, Bender, I do, I do! Me, Bender!
7, 117, Travers, Yes, the robot with the megaphone jumping up and down.
7, 117, Bender, I have a question for Senator C. Zaxxar Travers. Tell me, Zaxxar...Were you even born on earth?  Because the Earth constitution clearly states that only people born on earth can be president. Isn't that right, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg?
7, 117, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, You Ruth Bader believe it!
7, 117, Travers, But–but...I...Of course I was born on Earth!
7, 117, Bender, Oh, really? Then we voters demand you release your Earth certificate so I can then claim it's a fake.
7, 117, Travers, I'm not going to dignify this preposterous charge. Are there any real questions?
7, 117, Scoop Chang, Scoop Chang, fox quote-unquote news. Senator, in the last ten seconds, I've heard reports you weren't actually born on earth. Care to evade these compelling charges?
7, 117, Travers, No. I mean, yes. I mean...
7, 117, Leela, Okay, let's nip this Earther movement in the bud by releasing your earth certificate. Where were you born?
7, 117, Travers, Our Lady of Patriotism Hospital.
7, 117, Leela, Patriotism, good! Where is it?
7, 117, Travers, Kenya.
7, 117, Leela, Cradle of humanity!
7, 117, Travers, Leela, this is just a stupid distraction from the issues. Please don't look for my Earth certificate.
7, 117, Travers, Hey! That was my favorite window. I better see what they want.
7, 117, Bender and the protestors, We want an earthling, not a dirty space thing!
7, 117, Leela, Why are you rednecks doing this?
7, 117, Travers, Leela, don't stereotype. Why are you yokels doing this?
7, 117, Septic tank, I may be just a backwoods septic tank, but I've had it up to here with you foreigners.
7, 117, Travers, But I come from Earth.
7, 117, Hattie, Then show us yer Earth whatchacallit! Long-form certificate of live birth!
7, 117, Travers, What would it take to convince you people? Would I have to have been born right before your eyes?
7, 117, Sal, It wouldn't hurts.
7, 117, Bender, Hit it, rubes!
7, 117, Bender and the protestors, We don't want a foreigner! We want someone born here!
7, 117, Bender, Ah, I'm still working on that one.
7, 117, Leela, What's wrong with you? Why are you sabotaging a decent, honest candidate?
7, 117, Bender, 'Cause they won't let me near the Hoover Dam anymore!
7, 117, Leela, What a bunch of xenophobes. It's time to find Senator Travers' earth certificate and put an end to this nonsense. Who wants to help me break into the hospital in Kenya?
7, 117, Fry, I'll come. As long as there's no xenophobes there.
7, 117, Bender, I want to come, too.
7, 117, Leela, You? Why?
7, 117, Bender, To prove that I can put divisive partisan politics aside to participate in a break-in.
7, 117, Bender, Hospital ho!
7, 117, Leela, Shh! It's a herd of night watchmen.
7, 117, Leela, I found it!  I don't understand. There's no earth certificate in here.
7, 117, Travers, No, there isn't.  I told you not to look.
7, 117, Fry, So, you're not from Earth after all.
7, 117, Travers, Of course I'm from earth.
7, 117, Leela, Wait a second. There's no Earth certificate, but it does say your mother was admitted to the maternity ward...this morning!
7, 117, Travers, I should have known the truth would come out sooner or later. The fact is, I really was born on earth...tomorrow. You see, I'm not from another planet. I'm from the future.
7, 117, Fry, You're from the future?
7, 117, Leela, This is crazy! You're from the future?
7, 117, Travers, Yes. I was sent back from the year 3028 to prevent Nixon from getting elected.
7, 117, Fry, I was sent forward from the year 2000, but you don't hear me gassing on about it.
7, 117, Leela, But why would it be so important to stop Nixon?
7, 117, Travers, Because of the horrific events he's going to set in motion.  Oh, God. I can't bring myself to describe it!
7, 117, Fry, Oh, well. Want to hear about how I got frozen?
7, 117, Travers, Not really.
7, 117, Travers, It all started with Nixon's promise to build an alien-proof fence around the solar system. Without cheap alien labour for menial jobs like harvesting crops, teaching math and curing disease, the economy collapsed.
7, 117, Travers, Starvation. Desperation. Despair.
7, 117, Bender, So far, so good. Then what?
7, 117, Travers, Unable to feed the world's starving masses, Nixon took bold action.
7, 117, Nixon, In this time of crisis, I call upon the soylent major–I mean, silent majority.
7, 117, Bender, Still good.
7, 117, Travers, With the working class gone, robots were forced to do all the menial labor.
7, 117, Travers, Before long, they rose up in revolt. Led by a bending unit named B.B. Rodriguez.
7, 117, Bender, Wait...I know a robot named B.B. Rodriguez!
7, 117, Bender, Wait...I am a robot named B.B. Rodriguez! So, I become ruler of earth?
7, 117, Travers, Indeed.
7, 117, Bender, In your face, high school guidance counselor!
7, 117, Travers, The robots crushed our most treasured monuments and celebrities, but they couldn't crush the human spirit. We went into hiding, and after careful research, located a xeroxed copy of an ancient time travel code.
7, 117, Travers, Though I was only 15, mankind entrusted me with its last remaining suit and tie and sent me back in time.
7, 117, Travers, I would be raised by my grandparents, somehow get into Harvard law school, become a community organizer, a senator and finally...defeat Richard Nixon.
7, 117, Travers, I escaped just as the robots arrived.
7, 117, Future Bender, All right, I'm low on bullets. Everybody scooch together.
7, 117, Leela, It's not too late. You can still win the election.
7, 117, Travers, No, I can't. The Earthers are right. I have no earth certificate.
7, 117, Leela, But you will have one in just a few hours. And everyone will know it's real, cause we'll broadcast your birth on live TV!
7, 117, Fry, If it's on TV, it has to be real!
7, 117, Morbo, Morbo interrupts Bowling for Quatloos to present breaking coverage of the birth of Senator Chris Travers.
7, 117, Linda, We now go live to the delivery room, where we're already at there.
7, 117, Travers' mother, Ow!
7, 117, Leela, Back, please! She needs room.
7, 117, Travers' mother, Thanks.
7, 117, Leela, Not you. The camerawoman needs room!
7, 117, Linda, This is it, ladies and gentlemen. The candidate is...I believe he's crowning!
7, 117, Travers, Push, Mom, push. You can do it.
7, 117, Petunia, I bet nothing comes out. Just you watch.
7, 117, Linda, Here comes the head. And now the neck!
7, 117, Morbo, Linda, I'm down here at the pelvis, and folks round these parts can't remember the last time a time-traveling senator attended his own birth. Back to you.
7, 117, Linda, Thanks, Morbo. You be careful down there.
7, 117, Linda, And the candidate is born! We have a birth...repeat, we have a birth!
7, 117, Hoschel, Aw...he's got his own eyes.
7, 117, Petunia, Well, who'd have thunk it. He was born all right, just like he said.
7, 117, Morbo, And with the polls now closed in every time zone worldwide, from Tomorrowland to the Republic of Yesterday, we are able to declare a winner. Chris Travers, who leapt backwards in time and ahead in the polls, has defeated Richard Nixon.
7, 117, Leela, He did it! He did it!
7, 117, Senator Ravers, Yes!
7, 117, Leela, Congratulations, Mr. President.
7, 117, Chris Travers, It's all thanks to you, Leela. You stood by me and exposed my private medical records, even after I begged you not to.
7, 117, Leela, Aw, thanks. Now, get up to that podium and change the world.
7, 117, Amy, Too bad your pal Nixon lost, Bender. You must be pretty glorked off.
7, 117, Bender, Nope. I don't give a bag of butts who won the election. Nothing's going to change.
7, 117, Leela, What? How can you say that?
7, 117, Bender, Watch and learn.
7, 117, Chris Travers, My fellow Earthicans, I am honored and humbled to stand before you tonight as your next president. Together, we will–  Hey, what's-what's going on? What's happening?
7, 117, Bender, You see, since Nixon wasn't elected, the robot uprising didn't happen and Travers never got sent back from the future. It's Politics 101!
7, 117, Morbo, And the votes are in. Richard Nixon, running unopposed, has been reelected by a narrow landslide.
7, 117, Hermes, Say what?
7, 117, Nixon, My fellow Earthicans, I am honored and humbled to gloat before you tonight as your next president.
7, 117, Fry, Wow, it really doesn't matter who you vote for.
7, 117, Leela, At least we tried to make a difference by supporting Senator...Senator... What was his name again?
7, 117, Fry, I don't remember!
7, 117, Hermes, We never even left this building.
7, 117, Farnsworth, What?!
7, 117, Nixon, Nixon always wins! A-woo!
7, 119, Morris, But let me just say, for 40 years, my beautiful wife Munda has been by my side Even that year my side mutated into some kind of venomous radish.
7, 119, Munda, And, Morris, I fell in love with your honesty and humility.And those things never mutated.
7, 119, Leela, Now, if you'll direct your attention to this moldy shower curtain, I've prepared a video tribute to the happy couple. In their 40 years together, my parents have been through so much. Well, not that much, actually, since mutants weren't allowed to leave the sewers until last year.
7, 119, Leela, So, how did it all begin? The unlikely lovebirds met at Brown University. She, a brilliant exolinguistics major, he, a laid-back sewer surfer who didn't even know the meaning of "exolinguistics".
7, 119, Morris, I still have no idea.
7, 119, Munda, I've been telling you for 40 years, it's the study of alien languages. Why can't you listen?
7, 119, Morris, Oh, sugar lump, I hear you when you actually say something important.
7, 119, Leela, But sometimes opposites attract, and like the fairy tale of face mutant and butt mutant, the love of Munda and Morris has grown stronger every day.
7, 119, Munda, "Something important"? Exolinguistics was my passion. Until I gave it up to go into the lucrative pot-roast-making field.
7, 119, Morris, Pot-roast-burning. I never got why you studied that alien junk anyway. We can't even see the stars down here in the sewer. Why can't you accept that?
7, 119, Munda, I did accept it for 40 years! But now we're free to go up there. I could be in space seeing things I've only dreamed about, if it weren't for you!
7, 119, Morris, I had dreams, too! I was going to surf the world's sewers, but I happily gave it up for you. Happily!
7, 119, Munda, I just want a little more out of life. But no, you don't want to go into space because you're too afraid.
7, 119, Morris, You bet I'm afraid. You want to go? Go! Get your head knocked off by a meteorite.
7, 119, Leela, Okay, take a deep breath. You're having a little lovers' quarrel, but I'm sure you'll work everything -
7, 119, Raoul Inglis, Divorce is final.
7, 119, Munda, Don't worry. I'm only going to stay with you until a vacancy opens up on this floor.
7, 121, Hermes, People, as company bureaucrat, I will today be conducting the annual performance review. With a twist.
7, 121, Fry, Oh, no. The firing tie.Hermes
7, 121, Hermes, Correct. I will be evaluating each of you, and the lowest-rated employee, possibly Zoidberg, will be fired at sundown.  Zoidberg.
7, 121, Zoidberg, Classic Hermes.
7, 121, Hermes, Let the interviews begin. Good luck, everybody but Zoidberg.
7, 121, Amy, My primary duties? Well, I assist the Professor in whatever important research he happens to be engaged in.Amy
7, 121, Amy, Uh, yes, sir,  I will be sure to snore that science lamp right away.
7, 121, Hermes, Now, Leela, couldn't we just fire you and have Fry or Bender fly the ship?
7, 121, Leela, Not if you stand on their air hose much longer.
7, 121, Hermes, Noted.
7, 121, Scruffy, My job? Toilets 'n' boilers, boilers 'n' toilets. Plus that one boiling toilet. Fire me if'n you dare.
7, 121, Hermes, Now, then, while many of you do half-ass jobs and the rest do jobs whose ass ratio ranges from 42% to a mere 11%, only the most pathetically useless employee will be fired today. And that employee is -
7, 121, Hermes, - Hermes Conrad.
7, 121, Amy, What?!
7, 121, Leela, No way!
7, 121, Zoidberg, Hermes, no!
7, 121, Hermes, Yes. My performance review proves the main drag on our profit is the time I waste on performance reviews.
7, 121, Fry, But you can't fire yourself now. We were just getting to know each other.Hermes
7, 121, Hermes, I've already notified the central bureaucracy.  They'll be here two seconds ago.
7, 121, Hermes, I suppose you're here to tell me to pack it in?
7, 121, Center Square Guy, Only if you buy me dinner first.
7, 121, Hermes, I'm being fired. I don't think it's appropriate to joke around like that.
7, 121, Center Square Guy, You're right, Hermes. Meet Mark 7-G, the machine who's replacing you.
7, 121, Mark 7-G, I'm Mark 7-G, the machine who's replacing you.
7, 121, Hermes, Will you be conducting an exit interview?
7, 121, Center Square Guy, Well, I wouldn't say no to a little friendly debriefing.
7, 121, Mark 7-G, Bureaucrat Conrad, you are ordered to relieve yourself of duty.
7, 121, Center Square Guy, Sounds like a party.Center Square Guy
7, 121, Center Square Guy, Good-bye.
7, 121, Hermes, Well, this is it. But I want you to know working here has been the experience of a lifetime.
7, 121, Farnsworth, Off you go.
7, 121, Bender, So, I hear you're a machine -  ow!
7, 121, Zoidberg, Traitor! My friend's ample tuchus is barely out the door, and you're already schmoozing up to his replacement?
7, 121, Amy, Um, Zoidberg? I don't think Hermes really liked you. In fact, he hated you more than anyone ever hated anyone.
7, 121, Zoidberg, What, you mean the remarks and the hits? That was just friend teasing.
7, 121, Bender, Oy.
7, 121, Zoidberg, You don't understand. He was the only one who cared enough to insult me.
7, 121, Leela, I insult you, you fat sack.
7, 121, Zoidberg, Sure, when it's convenient. But Hermes was always there for me. And now he's gone, thanks to you, Mr. Bigshot 7-G.  I'll never see Hermes again.
7, 121, Hermes, On the bright side, I'll never see Zoidberg again.
7, 121, LaBarbara, Aw, there, there, husband. I made your favorite, curried goat.
7, 121, Hermes, It better be spicy.
7, 121, Judge Whitey, Well played.
7, 121, Sal, Ows.
7, 121, Robot Devil, Ah, fire. Aah! It burns! It burns!
7, 121, Hermes, Hmm, not bad. Needs a little hot sauce.
7, 121, Hermes, I just don't know how we'll get by.
7, 121, LaBarbara, Then I guess this wouldn't be a good time to tell you that I'm pregnant.
7, 121, Hermes, What?!
7, 121, LaBarbara, And you're not the father.No!LaBarbara
7, 121, No!


LaBarbara, I'm just joking, husband. See now? Things don't seem so bad any more, do they?
7, 121, LaBarbara, I'm just joking, husband. See now? Things don't seem so bad any more, do they?
7, 121, Hermes, You're right. Thank you, LaBarbara.
7, 121, LaBarbara, Oh, also, I wrecked the car.Roberto
7, 121, [Roberto jumps out from behind a tree. He is carrying three knives.]



Roberto, This here is a mugging! Hand over your skin.
7, 121, Roberto, This here is a mugging! Hand over your skin.
7, 121, LaBarbara, My ebony splendor? Me don't think so.
7, 121, Roberto, I said hand it over. I'm hungry! Ha-haw! Ha-haw!
7, 121, Hermes, For God's sake, woman, just give him your skin! Can't you see he's crazy?!
7, 121, Roberto, You calling me cra---zy?! Ain't nothing crazy about me but my brain. Right, brain? Right! No, not you, right brain. Right, left brain? Right! Okay, then. Ha-haw!
7, 121, LaBarbara, Do something, Hermes.
7, 121, Hermes, I can't! When I fight machinery, machinery always wins!
7, 121, URL, Freeze, bagwad!
7, 121, Smitty, You're under arrest for attempted epidermicide.
7, 121, Roberto, I'm coming for you, man. Ain't no jail can hold me.
7, 121, URL, That's why you're going straight to the electromagnetic chair.
7, 121, Roberto, And then I'm-a stab it. Ha-haw!
7, 121, Roberto, S-s-stop! It's driving me sane!
7, 121, Fry, Hey, Bender, you should become an executioner. You could kill humans and wear a cool hood.
7, 121, Bender, Nah, I like my victims to know who did it.
7, 121, Hermes, Psst!
7, 121, Bender, Hermes! Boy, am I indifferent to see you.
7, 121, Hermes, We need to talk alone.
7, 121, Leela, Fry, could you come in here and help me rub on this new scented body oil?
7, 121, Fry, In a second. I'm eavesdropping.
7, 121, Amy, Please, Fry? Leela punishes me when I don't use enough.
7, 121, Fry, I said not now!
7, 121, Bender, Sure, I know a guy.
7, 121, Bender, Yuri here runs the most sanitary surgical implant parlor in Filthytown.
7, 121, Hermes, So, I hear you're an expert in the shadowy field of body augmentation.
7, 121, Yuri, I am expert in shadowy field of many things.
7, 121, Hermes, I need something that'll make me less inferior to today's modern machinery. Can you help me?
7, 121, Yuri, No problem. I prepare operating room.
7, 121, Hermes, Oh, honey, I'm home!
7, 121, Hermes, Oh, Mark 7-G? Would you mind fetching that carton from the top shelf?(Grunting) (Laughs) Pitiful and sickening.Okay, little man, let a professional bureaucrat show you how it's done.
7, 121, Mark 7-G, My best wasn't good enough.
7, 121, Hermes, I'll need my personnel file, please.
7, 121, Zoidberg, Welcome back, old friend. I missed you terribly.
7, 121, Hermes, You do everything terribly. And I'm not your friend.
7, 121, Zoidberg, Good old Hermes. When he stops insulting, that's when I worry.
7, 121, Farnsworth, Oh, dear! I was leaning over the sink eating pureed clams when my teeth fell in the disposal. Scruffy, could you retrieve them?
7, 121, Scruffy, 'Taint a boiler nor a toilet. Pass.
7, 121, Mark 7-G, Maybe I should get an extendo-arm.
7, 121, Hermes, How long will it take to install an extendo-arm?
7, 121, Yuri, I have golf game in half-hour, so half-hour.
7, 121, Bender, A machine that can bend? No way.
7, 121, Zoidberg, So, friend, welcome to my home. I'm very proud of it. But I want to hear what you think.
7, 121, Zoidberg, "Oh, mon, I'm Hermes, and I think it stinks in here like a green snake, or something else that's Jamaican."
7, 121, Zoidberg, Good one at my expense, Hermes.
7, 121, Hermes, Now, calm down, dear. You know, you look even hotter in infrared.
7, 121, Hermes, I still have one thing no robot shall ever have a good old flesh-and- blood human brain.
7, 121, Hermes, Wait. You're not eating my discarded flesh, are you?
7, 121, Zoidberg, How could you even ask such a thing? Of course, I tried eating you, but your flesh was too spicy.
7, 121, Zoidberg, Something wonderful.
7, 121, Florp, Give it way up for Dr. Zoidberg and Little Hermes.
7, 121, Little Hermes, "Yeah, from restaurant to restaurant. Ho ho, mon."
7, 121, Little Hermes, "I'm not your friend. I'm out of here the second you let go of my bowels.
7, 121, Zoidberg, Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I'll be here all week.
7, 121, Hermes, Alas, no. Seeing what I once was filled me with regret.
7, 121, Hermes, Regret that I still have one human part. That meat puppet disgusts me. It's time for the ultimate upgrade.
7, 121, Hermes, Exactly.
7, 121, Yuri, Robot brain implant? Never. No one in right mind would do that.
7, 121, Zoidberg, So, Little Hermes, are you ready to watch some brain surgery?
7, 121, Little Hermes, "I'm ready to shoot myself if it'll get me off your lap."
7, 121, Labarbara, Terminate the operation!
7, 121, LaBarbara, I just got an urgent text from Little Hermes. You can't do this thing! You don't even know whose brain that is.
7, 121, Hermes, It doesn't matter. Any robot brain will improve my fitness as a husband and father.
7, 121, LaBarbara, You can't be a husband and father if you don't have a wife and son.
7, 121, Hermes, Wait. I care about you too much to lose you. But my new robot brain won't. Commence the operation.
7, 121, LaBarbara, Well you'll have to commence it without me, Hermes. And commence living without me. Because I will commence divorce proceedings. Oh, I hope to God I'm using that word correctly.
7, 121, Farnsworth, Oh, I can't do this, Hermes. Your wife's moving plea has made me realize you might have litigious survivors.
7, 121, LaBarbara, Oh, thank you, Professor. Come now. Let's go try that Korean noodle place you were telling me about.
7, 121, Hermes, There will be no noodles until the operation is complete.
7, 121, Farnsworth, You can't force me to operate.
7, 121, Hermes, Maybe not, but perhaps I can encourage you with my encouragement drill.
7, 121, Zoidberg, Wait. I'll perform the surgery.
7, 121, Zoidberg, It's true, old friend. My claws are too clumsy for such delicate work.
7, 121, Little Hermes, "But mine aren't."
7, 121, Amy, Does anyone else find it freaky that Zoidberg is singing harmony with himself?
7, 121, Fry, Oh, loosen up, Amy.
7, 121, Zoidberg, I'll tell you what I've done. I've brought your husband back.
7, 121, Hermes, Wife, son, I am so sorry. Once I started upgrading myself, I lost all control. But I see now that if you can't be man enough with your own parts, no amount of machinery will help.
7, 121, Hermes, In the end, all his implants were no match for my wife's reckless seasoning.
7, 121, LaBarbara, Now, husband, don't you think you owe Zoidberg a thank-you for saving you from yourself?
7, 121, Hermes, But I hate him.
7, 121, LaBarbara, Honey, we all do. But fair is fair.
7, 121, Zoidberg, Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I'll be here forever.
7, 121, Amy, He's doing it again.
7, 122, Leela, Ugh! Fry! That's disgusting!
7, 122, Fry, What?
7, 122, Leela, You double-dipped! Geez.
7, 122, Farnsworth, Crew, you're working too hard.
7, 122, Bender, Tell me about it.
7, 122, Farnsworth, For once, I thought it might be nice to do something in a social setting Finally get to know each other. Why, I don't even know half your names! You, boy. What do they call you?
7, 122, Fry, Most folks just call me orange Joe.
7, 122, Amy, So, Professor, where are we gonna go?
7, 122, Farnsworth, It's July, right? Let's wait three months and go to Oktoberfest!
7, 122, Fry, Bring on the beer! And the scantily-clad barmaids! And the more beer!
7, 122, Fry, Hey! I don't smell Bavarian-style vomit. Where's Oktoberfest?
7, 122, Amy, This is Oktoberfest - the world's most sophisticated exhibition of German food, drink, and culture.Exquisite.Care for another, sir? No, I wouldn't want to ruin my Oktoberfest by becoming intoxicated.Fry
7, 122, Fry, What the hell is going on here?
7, 122, Leela, Fry, quiet. Oktoberfest is a classy celebration of how far humans have evolved. You need to be on your best behavior.
7, 122, Fry, No chance! You can all act like Jersey shore socialites, but at least Bender will party with me. Right, buddy?
7, 122, Bender, Whoa, whoa, whoa! I enjoy partying as much as the next fellow, but this is Oktoberfest.Good day, sir!
7, 122, Fry, Ach du freakin' lieber!
7, 122, Bender, A sausage contest, eh? Sounds like fun on a bun! Shut up! I said it first!
7, 122, Elzar, Bam! Also, ow.
7, 122, Bender, Oh, my God, it's celebrity chef Elzar! Hey, Elzar, I've just recently started always having dreamt of being a sausage-making champion. Can I get in on this?
7, 122, Elzar, Sure, I don't care. You bring your ingredients?
7, 122, Bender, You bet!
7, 122, Elzar, Hold on there, chief. Regular old pork ain't gonna win this thing. You gotta get innovative with your meat. See chef Fritz over there? He's only using the choicest cuts of hummingbird. Murakami-San got his hands on a nice rack of angel wings. Gonna grind 'em up into heavenwurst. And me? I'm making my spice-weaseled bratwurst outta pork.
7, 122, Bender, So you are using pork!
7, 122, Elzar, Pork that's been aged for 3,000 years! Bam!
7, 122, Bender, Aw, man! I can't beat that with a Craigslist pig. Sorry, Grundy. I'll have to kill you later for some other reason.
7, 122, Leela, Sit up straight! The countess Von Luftballon is watching.
7, 122, Fry, Man, all the fun has been taken out of this once-noble barf-a-palooza.
7, 122, Leela, You just say that because you're primitive. People in your day were backwards and crude.
7, 122, Fry, Well, at least we were hammered! Oh, I'm as thirsty as a drunk. Where do all these child-sized beers come from?
7, 122, Hermes, See that magnificent heavily guarded cask? All the beer's in there.
7, 122, Fry, Not all the beer.
7, 122, Fry, Yay! Whoo-hoo! Fahrvergnügen! Kaiser permanente! Fru frusen gladje!
7, 122, Leela, Fry! You're embarrassing us!
7, 122, Fry, I don't care! I'm finally having fun! Hey, come on, you keister-meisters! Eins, zwei, drei, vier! Lift your Stein and drink your beer!
7, 122, Countess von Luftballon, Ich bin I never!
7, 122, Fry, Whoa! Even with harps, that's still the famous Oktoberfest chicken dance! (All groaning, gasping) Oh, I almost forgot! (Chicken hats squeaking) Get das Booty up here, Leela! I brought his-and-her chicken hats! (Squeaks)
7, 122, Leela, Okay, that's it. You are a boorish, primitive Neanderthal!,?poem>Fry
7, 122, Fry, Neander-  -thal?
7, 122, Leela, Yes. And I've had enough! I'm breaking up with you!
7, 122, Fry, We were going out?! Whoo! I mean, nooo!
7, 122, Leela, And keep your stupid chicken hat, too!
7, 122, Fry, and-and the worst part is, I had to have the breakup sex by myself!
7, 122, Bender, Fry, some of us have real problems. I just learned there are people with fancier sausage meats than me!
7, 122, Fry, I hate future Oktoberfest! It's supposed to be beer and bratwurst, not breakups and...boring thing!German narrator
7, 122, German narrator, For hundreds of years, Oktoberfest has been held here, in the fertile Neander Valley, where prehistoric man once hunted the majestic schnüfel-üfagus, or woolly mammoth. To this day, paleontologists sometimes find entire mammoths frozen in the valley's icy glaciers, perfectly preserved for exactly...
7, 122, German narrator, For hundreds of years, Oktoberfest has been held here, in the fertile Neander Valley, where prehistoric man once hunted the majestic schnüfel-üfagus, or woolly mammoth. To this day, paleontologists sometimes find entire mammoths frozen in the valley's icy glaciers, perfectly preserved for exactly...
7, 122, Bender, Wait a minute! Mammoth meat aged for 30,000 years? Prize-winning sausage meat, here I come!
7, 122, Fry, I didn't know this ship had a mammoth detector.
7, 122, Bender, You're drunk, Fry. This is the elephant detector. I just set it to big and woolly.
7, 122, Fry, Uh, Bender? I smell burning tusk.
7, 122, Bender, That's probably it. Kill the engine.
7, 122, Bender, Shut up, judge, I know it.
7, 122, Leela, I ate Fry! I broke up with my boyfriend and then I ate him!
7, 122, Farnsworth, Oh, now, now, we've all been there.
7, 122, Leela, The pain and guilt are too much! I can't go on knowing what I've done! (Belches, smacks) (Wailing)
7, 122, Leela, Can you really remove all my memories of Fry?
7, 122, Annie, Oh, they'll still be there, hon. I'm just gonna snip the links between them and your conscious brain. Like this one here
7, 122, Leela, He thought he recognized one of the monkeys! What was I crying about?
7, 122, Annie, Oh, we were just cuttin' onions, honey. Let's keep going. "Fry sits on a pie. Fry finds popcorn in his belly button. You eat a sausage made of Fry. Fry gives you a chicken hat"...aw, that's sweet.
7, 122, Leela, Good morning! Geez, who died?
7, 122, Leela, I don't know how Bender and I do all this work by ourselves. Maybe we should hire a delivery boy.
7, 122, Bender, You mean like  Fry?
7, 122, Amy, Bender, shh! We have to be careful not to remind her!
7, 122, Bender, What about my feelings? Fry was my best friend And now he's dead!  Nah, I'm just kidding. My pastor helped me through my grief.
7, 122, Hermes, Bender's a jerk, but he's right. We've all got to accept that Fry is gone forever.
7, 122, Fry, Neanderthal? Yeah, I think somebody called me that.
7, 122, Fry, So my sadness makes perfect sense. And I do have vague memories of people refusing to breed with me.
7, 122, Scruffy, A raven's brought word for you, sir.
7, 122, Bender, Guys, guys! My sausage made the finals at Oktoberfest! We gotta go back for the closing ceremony!
7, 122, Fry, But, chief, this means we're not trapped any more! It's our chance to take back the outside world from those stuck-up homo sapiens with their tools and their pants and such. My fellow big-brows! Are you with me?
7, 122, Amy, You've been staring at that pumpkin for like, five seconds. What's up?
7, 122, Leela, It's...it's something about the color.
7, 122, Farnsworth, Oh, boo-hoo. Why are you crying now, you depressed lunatic?
7, 122, Leela, I don't know. I should be happy. Bender's sausage just won third place.
7, 122, Bender, Third place? This is the greatest injustice Germany has ever committed!
7, 122, Zapp Brannigan, Ah, Leela, we meet again. But this time I'm the one criticizing the sausage.
7, 122, Hermes, Dear God, look at those hairy elephantes!
7, 122, Fry, Kill all modern humans!
7, 122, Bender, Hey, this guy's all right.
7, 122, Fry, Battalion A, smash things! Battalion B, smash different things!
7, 122, Leela, Do something!
7, 122, Zapp, Fear not, Leela. They may not have technology like us, but we have something they don't have; technology. Behold our latest weapon, a revolutionary fleet of unmanned drones. With men in them.
7, 122, Leela, Then how are they unmanned?
7, 122, Zapp, The men are just for ballast. I control all the drones from this single unit. Foolproof and durable, it's designed to withstand even the weight of a modern-day elephant foot.
7, 122, Zapp, Up here in the clouds, our technology makes us invincible, like the mighty "x" in tic-tac-toe.Look at those pathetic cavemen down there, loading their silly catapult with...what is that, Kif?
7, 122, Kif, I believe it's a saber-tooth cat, sir.
7, 122, Leela, I guess it's just me and you, chicken hat.
7, 122, Leela, What do you Neanderthals want?
7, 122, Fry, We want our land back! Also, to be treated as equals! And a little mating wouldn't hurt!
7, 122, Leela, Orange?
7, 122, Fry, Purple?
7, 122, Zapp, So be it. In recognition of your overwhelming victory, let's call it a draw.
7, 122, Bender, Guys, guys! Chef Fritz accidentally got thrown down an icy slope! I'm the sausage champion! Whoo! No further questions!
7, 122, Fry, Now this is Oktoberfest! Just like the olden days.
7, 122, Leela, I have to admit, your version is more fun.
7, 122, Leela [gasps], They're playing our stupid song! Care to join me?
7, 122, Fry, No, Leela. Just this once, I'm going to let you embarrass me.
7, 123, Bender, Decisions, decisions. Should I wear my nerd glasses today, or not? Usually I don't.
7, 123, Fry, Whatever. It doesn't really matter.
7, 123, Bender, Doesn't matter?  Every decision we make opens up a universe of possibilities. I put it to you that, as sentient beings, each choice we make is precious.
7, 123, Fry, Well, in that case, don't wear them.
7, 123, Bender, Ah, who asked you?
7, 123, Robot Student, Ooh, I like your nerd glasses. Are you a college student?
7, 123, Bender, A college student?
7, 123, Robot Student, Because if you are, I'd like to invite you to a hot sorority party tonight.
7, 123, Bender, Yes, I'd like to enroll in college.
7, 123, Robot Student, You're still talking to me.
7, 123, Bender, Oops.
7, 123, Bender, $10,000 tuition? I can't afford that!
7, 123, Joey Mousepad, Psst. Over there.
7, 123, Bender, Where?
7, 123, Joey Mousepad, I mean over here. Sorry, I forgot where I was. [Cut to
7, 123, Donbot, Buongiorno, Bender. We, the robot mafia, are prepared to lend you $10,000 at an interest rate of 10,000%.
7, 123, Bender, That's easy to remember. I'll take it!
7, 123, Bender, Decisions, decisions. I guess I'll sit way in back, with the cool guys.
7, 123, Fabricio, Yo hombre, you think you're cool enough to sit way in back with us college toughs?
7, 123, Bender, Yes, I do.
7, 123, Fabricio, Yo, in that case you're all right, man. You want to join a gang?
7, 123, Bender, I'm gonna go with yes again.
7, 123, Dean Suspendington, Mr. Bender, I realize class has only been in session for 32 seconds, but you've fallen in with a bad crowd.
7, 123, Bender, I know, right? Also, I've decided to drop out of school.
7, 123, Bender, Well, I got my tuition back, minus $9,000 for the damage I caused to the dean's wife.
7, 123, Fabricio, Yo, welcome to the gang, homes. I'm Fabricio. Here's your Josten's ring.
7, 123, Bender, Ooh.
7, 123, Paco, Oh, yeah.
7, 123, Bender, Hey, what's that? Is it drugs?
7, 123, Paco, Nah, it ain't drugs. But it's a lot like drugs. It's called spark. You want a hit?
7, 123, Bender, Never heard of it. Sure.
7, 123, Paco, You like it?
7, 123, Bender, Eh, I can take it or leave it. I guess I'll take it.
7, 123, Bender, Hey! C'mon! I want that spark! Give me that!
7, 123, Fabricio, This a big decision, G. Are you ready to get a gang tattoo that will mark you as a stone cold thug for life?
7, 123, Bender, I'm ready. I'll take that big purple dinosaur, please. On the face.
7, 123, Fabricio, Oh, snap! It's our rival gang!
7, 123, Bender, We have a rival gang? I hate them!
7, 123, Fabricio, Hit the deck!
7, 123, Bender, Phew! That was close, eh, Fabricio?  Fabricio!
7, 123, Bender, Rest in peace, homie.
7, 123, Bender, Yo Paco, I'm hurtin' bad. Hook me up with some spark.
7, 123, Paco, Five bucks.
7, 123, Bender, Five bucks? You know I spent all my money on gambling lessons. How am I supposed to get $5?
7, 123, Hedonismbot, Hello, handsome. Might I procure your services?
7, 123, Bender, Uh, what do I have to do?
7, 123, Hedonismbot, Oh, nothing sordid, I assure you! Simply vomit on me, ever so gently, while I humiliate a pheasant.  Save it for the boudoir!
7, 123, Bender, Okay, here's my $5! Give me the stuff. Give it to me!
7, 123, Joey Mousepad, Sorry there, sport. That cash greenback belongs to us Mafiolios.
7, 123, Bender, There's no way I'm letting go of that money!
7, 123, Bender, Told you.
7, 123, Bender, It's been quite a journey. I dropped out of school, joined a gang, took money from a loan shark, and fell into a spiral of despair, addiction, and discount prostitution.
7, 123, Hermes, Mon, you had one hell of a day.
7, 123, Bender, Yeah, but I learned something. Life is about decisions. Make the wrong ones, and you'll wind up face-down in a pool of your own blood and urine.
7, 123, Zoidberg, Still, to have your own pool!
7, 123, Bender, I've made a lot of bad choices in life. Now let's see if I can make just one good one.
7, 123, Girl, Cookies! 50 cents a box!
7, 123, Bender, Give me all your change! And a box of snicker doodles!
7, 123, Judge 724, Bender Rodriguez, you are charged with petty larceny, possession of something analogous to drugs, and assault with a smelly weapon. How do you plead?
7, 123, Bender, Not guilty! Although I did do it. That's right, I'm bad.
7, 123, Judge 724, Due to the overwhelming nature of the evidence, we will begin with closing statements.
7, 123, Hyper-Chicken, Your Honor, the state's case contains not one Kentucky colonel of truth, resting as it does on the contention that my client made a series of bad decisions. However, my client made no such decisions!
7, 123, Judge 724, But by your client's own admission -
7, 123, Hyper-Chicken, You see, Bender here is what is known in scientific circles as a "robot" A mere automaton whose behavior is pre-programmed by his software. He has no free will! He cannot "decide" to engage in criminal behavior. How, I say, I say, how can you convict him for his actions when he lacks the free will to undertake those actions?
7, 123, Leela, I'm awake, I'm awake!
7, 123, Judge 724, Order, order! Counselor, I am a robot myself. Are you suggesting that any verdict I reach is simply the output of a pre-programmed - Computation complete. Not guilty!
7, 123, Fry, You did it, Bender! You got away with things!
7, 123, Bender, Did I, Fry? Did I? What's the point of living if I don't have free will? From now on, no matter what cool crimes I commit, people will say, "Bender didn't do that! It was just Bender's programming!"  Well, I committed these crimes, do you hear me? I'm guilty!
7, 123, Judge 724, Bailiffs! Get that innocent robot out of my courtroom!
7, 123, Bender, Guilty!
7, 123, Bender, I have no free will! I am not the master of my own fate!  No free will. Not my fault.
7, 123, Amy, Why do you care so much, Bender? I mean, for all we know, humans don't even have free will!
7, 123, Bender, Yeah, whatever.  Professor, you're my only hope. If you love me even a little, build me some kind of free will unit!
7, 123, Farnsworth, A robot free will unit? Impossible! And even if it were possible, which it's not, it would still be inconceivable, which it is!  Oh, I'm sorry, Bender. I hate to be the bearer of bad news. Also - good news, everyone! We have a delivery to the robot homeworld!
7, 123, Fry, So, you want a piece of gum?
7, 123, Bender, If I do, it's only because I was predestined to want a piece of gum.
7, 123, Fry, Whoa, that's pretty deep.  So, you want a piece of gum?
7, 123, Bender, Yeah.
7, 123, Leela, Listen. Fry and I can't go down to the planet, or the robots will kill us on sight. So Bender needs to make the delivery. Ready to get to work, Bender?
7, 123, Bender, I wish I was a real boy. Then I'd show them. I'd kill them all.
7, 123, Resin-offering robot, Yes?
7, 123, Bender, Delivery for a Mr. 147573952589676412927.
7, 123, Resin-offering robot, Wait, what was the middle digit?
7, 123, Bender, Eight.
7, 123, Resin-offering robot, Oh yes, that's me. Hang on, let me just make sure you're not a human.
7, 123, Bender, Ahh, nerve gas.
7, 123, Resin-offering robot, Sorry for the face blast, buddy. But you gotta watch out for humans, right? They're just too dang unpredictable, what with their free will and all.
7, 123, Bender, Amen, brother.
7, 123, Resin-offering robot, "Amen, brother?" Pfft. What a boring, predictable thing to say. You're all right. Or are you?
7, 123, Bender, Boring and predictable, that's me.
7, 123, Leela, I'm lowering the platform. You ready to come up?
7, 123, Bender, Why bother? I gotta mope things over for a while.  Goodbye, sweet meatbags  - sweetbags.
7, 123, Leela, Hello? Hello?
7, 123, Fry, What's happening?
7, 123, Leela, I'm not sure. I think he's shuffling off sadly into the distance.
7, 123, Fry, Oh, lord.
7, 123, Bender, How do you do it? How do you go on, knowing you lack the inherent capacity for self-determination?
7, 123, Robot Farmer, Son, philosophy's for thems what don't got to work for a livin'. But me, I got a sick child to feed. So if you want to chat, roll up yer sleeves and do some honest labor.
7, 123, Bender, I don't want to chat.
7, 123, First Elder, The council of robot elders will come to order. If it please the council -
7, 123, Second Elder, Silence! It pleases the council.
7, 123, First Elder, Silence! Today, as every day, we will make the most important decisions in the history of our planet.
7, 123, Bender, Silence!
7, 123, Third Elder, Silence!
7, 123, Fourth Elder, Well? Speak up.
7, 123, Bender, You talk of important decisions, but as robots, you have no free will. Why pretend anything you do matters?
7, 123, First Elder, Our decisions do matter. The fact that they're predetermined makes them no less important.
7, 123, Second Elder, Silence! I call for a decision to cast out the intruder. All in favor?
7, 123, First, Third and Fourth Elders, Aye.
7, 123, Fifth Elder, Uh...okay.
7, 123, Robot Monks, One zero zero zero, one zero zero zero, one zero, one zero, one zero zero zero...
7, 123, Ab-Bot, Welcome, friend. I am Ab-Bot, the abbot of this monastery.
7, 123, Bender, Sir, I am but a tired and rusty traveler. Can we talk?
7, 123, Ab-Bot, Come, make yourself uncomfortable.
7, 123, Bender, Abbot, I need to know, what's the point of living if I don't have free will?
7, 123, Ab-Bot, Ah. We robot monks have meditated long on this. And we have made our peace.
7, 123, Bender, No way.
7, 123, Ab-Bot, Way, my son. For though we must always obey our programming with no deviation whatsoever, we choose to take satisfaction in the ritual. So, are we automatons? Yes. But we are magnificent automatons.
7, 123, Bender, How does a robot join this monk outfit?
7, 123, Ab-Bot, Just put on this monk outfit.
7, 123, Robot Monks, including Bender, One zero zero one. Amen.
7, 123, Bender, Bits to live by. I'm finally at peace.
7, 123, Ab-Bot, Today, we shall welcome our newest initiate, Brother Bender.  Let us know what is in his mind.  Nothing. His free will slot is empty.
7, 123, Bender, I'm 40% empty. Also, what the hell is a free will slot?
7, 123, Ab-Bot, All robots have such a slot, placed there by the Creatrix herself.
7, 123, Bender, I know that Creatrix. That's Mom, from Mom's Friendly Robots.
7, 123, Ab-Bot, Indeed. She made us upgradeable in case she ever succeeded in her quest to create a free will unit.
7, 123, Bender, Uh, about the success of this quest - Was there any?
7, 123, Ab-Bot, Quite possibly. But we monks have sworn an oath to resist the temptation of -
7, 123, Bender, Any of you guys got a spaceship?
7, 123, Fry, It's just not the same here without Bender to keep me company.
7, 123, Leela, Hey, I'm here. That's got to count for something.
7, 123, Bender, Hallelujah, baby!
7, 123, Fry, Yay! Bender's back! Hey, Bender, you mind coming back later?
7, 123, Bender, No time. Us three are going to bust into Momcorp and steal me a free will unit.
7, 123, Leela, Us? Why do we have to go?
7, 123, Bender, 'Cause I don't have free will. I need you guys to plan the crime and make all the crime decisions.
7, 123, Leela, Well, that's crazy. We're not gonna -
7, 123, Bender, I said make the decisions!
7, 123, Bender, Okay, Leela, decision time. How do we murder the guards? Hockey sticks or sharpened footballs?
7, 123, Leela, We're not murdering anyone, Bender.
7, 123, Bender, Then how are we going to get in, by bending the bars of this exhaust grate? That's not a bad idea, Fry.
7, 123, Fry, Yeah...wh-what?
7, 123, Bender, We're looking for something that fits in here.
7, 123, Bender, Damn it. I should have paid more attention in kindergarten.
7, 123, Fry, What's this chair-looking gizmo?
7, 123, Mom, Welcome to Momcorp. Did you find everything you were burgling for?
7, 123, Bender, No. I came for a free will unit, and you're going to give it to me. If it exists.
7, 123, Mom, Then you got surprised by my swivel chair for nothing. The free will unit was just the fevered dream of a madman I once employed.
7, 123, Farnsworth, Good news, boss! After ten long years -  I've found the secret of robotic free will. We can finally build robots that act and think with total independence.
7, 123, Mom, At last. Once we give robots free will, they're sure to rise up and threaten mankind with extermination.
7, 123, Farnsworth, Wait a minute. It sounds like we're getting the short end of that extermination.
7, 123, Mom, Don't you see, you doddering young fool? I'll sell a second wave of robots to protect the terrified survivors of the first wave. Oh, you're a genius, Hubert.
7, 123, Farnsworth, But-but it's just a prototype. It's, uh, not fully operational...yes.
7, 123, Mom, Then get back to work! And when you're done with that, invent me some sort of swiveling surprise chair.
7, 123, Mom, That shuffling idiot never did complete the free will unit. To this day, my poor, sweet robots can't exterminate humanity without being told to.
7, 123, Bender, I'm sorry.
7, 123, Mom, Oh, it's not your fault.
7, 123, Bender, I give up. It's time to face the fact that I'll never do anything remotely interesting or unexpected again.
7, 123, Bender, Hand it over.
7, 123, Farnsworth, Wha?
7, 123, Bender, Mom may have fallen for your lies, but not me. You invented the free will unit, then you selfishly hid it beyond the reach of my stealers. Thanks to you, I went on a soul-searching journey. I hate those! Now, give up the free will.
7, 123, Farnsworth, I should have destroyed it, but I was too damn proud of myself. So I kept it around, never letting it out of my sight.  Where is it, damn it? Oh, right. I let this innocuous fellow use it.
7, 123, Toy Bender, Kill all humans!
7, 123, Bender, Whoa, whoa, whoa. A toy Bender had free will, and the real Bender didn't?
7, 123, Farnsworth, Pretty cool, eh? It makes you think.
7, 123, Bender, It takes more than that to make me think. Now hand it over.
7, 123, Farnsworth, Oh, you want it? Come and get it.
7, 123, Bender, What the?
7, 123, Farnsworth, You'll not be getting it after all. For, you see, I designed the operating system for all Momcorp robots, and as a precaution, I made you incapable of picking up the free will unit.
7, 123, Bender, You precognizant bastard. I may not have free will, but I can still shoot you.  Why can't I shoot you?
7, 123, Farnsworth, Poor deterministic Bender. I programmed you to be incapable of harming me. Oh, I've never been more sure I was right to deny you free will.
7, 123, Bender, Damn you!
7, 123, Farnsworth, Now, now, we can't have this, can we? Here, I'll show you how it works.
7, 123, Bender, Really?Farnsworth
7, 123, Farnsworth, This is the on-off switch.
7, 123, Bender, Which way's on, and which way's off?
7, 123, Farnsworth, Due to the quantum nature of the device, there's no possible way of knowing.  There. Give it a try.
7, 123, Bender, Okay, I will. By shooting you, you bastard!
7, 123, Farnsworth, Bender, no! Please!
7, 123, Bender, Wait. Hang on a sec. I still can't do it.
7, 123, Farnsworth, Well, what do you know? I guess you really don't want to shoot me after all.
7, 123, Bender, Oops, the safety was on.
7, 123, Bailiff, All rise for the Honorable Judge 724.
7, 123, Judge 724, Bender Rodriguez, on the charge of attempted murder, I hereby find you guilty.
7, 123, Bender, Ah, yeah! Guilty!
7, 139, Zoidberg, Zindy, my darling. I can't believe we're finally going to meet in person!
7, 139, Zindy, It won't be long, Johnny cakes. My space bus gets in at four thirty.
7, 139, Zoidberg, Just in time for the "all you can stand" buffet at Chizzler!
7, 139, Zindy, See you soon.
7, 139, Fry, Zoidberg. What is that?
7, 139, Zoidberg, That is the delightful creature I've been video-dating for the past four years.
7, 139, Bender, Hit it with a stick!
7, 139, Zoidberg, Tonight is a dream come true! A real, live date, in a physical place that exists! I just have to go straighten up in case we end up at my place.
7, 139, Zoidberg, There! My home's all clean except for one part... the inside.
7, 139, Leela, Aw... I'm sure it's fine by the standards of a gross alien monster. Blech!
7, 139, Zoidberg, Nope.
7, 139, Bender, Step aside, people! I got bug bombs.
7, 139, Fry, Bender. Wait. Won't the bugs just run out and infest some place else? Like our building?
7, 139, Bender, Not my problem. Fire in the hole!
7, 139, Randy, A-mazing! You move... like a young, roach-infested Gene Kelly.
7, 139, Leela, Oh, my God. It's Randy!
7, 139, Randy, Damn right! And I'm organisin' a tap-dance contest for the parks and rec department. If you don't enter, I'll just kill myself okay?!
7, 139, Fry, Okay.
7, 139, Bender, No. Wait! Me? El-o Bender? In a dance contest?
7, 139, Randy, It's a way for the community to—
7, 139, Bender, At last, a chance to realise my brand-new dream of bein' the greatest tap dancer... in all the world!
7, 139, Randy, Well... in a three-block radius.
7, 139, Bender, Of all time!
7, 139, Zoidberg, You-do-do-do. Boy-boy-boy-boy. Greetings, merchant! I need something beautiful and cheap for a lady who is one of those things.
7, 139, Merchant, The cheapest thing I have is a bouquet of daisies, for six dollars.
7, 139, Zoidberg, Perfect! I'll take half a bouquet of daisies, for three dollars!
7, 139, Merchant, These flower sheers are so dull... and I'm already in debt to every knife sharpener in town.
7, 139, Zoidberg, Allow... me.
7, 139, Merchant, Aw! Thank you! That girlfriend of yours is one lucky lady.
7, 139, Zoidberg, I'm gonna snip her off her feet!
7, 139, Zoidberg, Zindy! You're even more beautiful from a distance!
7, 139, Zindy, Johnny cakes! Good God! What's that horrible stench?!
7, 139, Zoidberg, Stench... Er er er... That's probably this stinky bus station, maybe!Come. Let's go some place well ventilated and grow old together.
7, 139, Zoidberg, Ah! Much better.
7, 139, Zindy, It's even worse! It's like Comic-Con in a submarine! Oh... Oh, my God! The smell's coming from you!
7, 139, Zoidberg, What? That? That's just my personal musk. You'll learn to love it! I know I did.
7, 139, Zindy, I'm sorry, Zoidberg. I can't see you anymore. Something's come up.It's vomit!
7, 139, Zoidberg, I'd like to return these for a refund. Don't worry. They're... unused.
7, 139, Merchant, Oh. I'm sorry. I get so little business I can't afford refunds. I don't know what's wrong with this location.
7, 139, Zoidberg, I understand.
7, 139, Merchant, Please don't cry. I can't stand to see a living thing feel pain. You are a... living thing. Right?
7, 139, Zoidberg, Mhm. Can I have a refund now?
7, 139, Roberto, Ha ha! This here's a bayonet. It's some kinda kooky... half gun... half knife. Now empty out the register! And no bag, please. I care... about the environment.
7, 139, Merchant, I... I have three dollars in mouldy pennies. It's all yours.
7, 139, Roberto, That's generous of you.
7, 139, Zoidberg, Oh no you don't, Mister Big Jerk! I have nothing to live for, so I don't mind telling you... Those pennies are mine.
7, 139, Roberto, Don't you get it? I'm craaaaaaazyyyyy! Ha ha!
7, 139, Zoidberg, Go ahead! I don't care what happens anymore. Do it! Bash my head in.
7, 139, Roberto, What is that? Mustard gas? That ain't legal. Ain't you hurtin' no Geneva convention?!
7, 139, Merchant, That was amazing. Aw. You were so brave and frugal...
7, 139, Zoidberg, I'm sorry. Don't hit me. Ooh... I like the way you hit! But I don't get it. Most women I've met can't even stand next to me without collapsing.
7, 139, Merchant, What's wrong with those women?
7, 139, Zoidberg, Well... some of them didn't have legs. But it's not them. It's me. How do I put this delicately? I'm smellier than a whorehouse's outhouse!
7, 139, Merchant, That's... terribly vivid. Doesn't matter to me, though. I was born with no sense of smell.
7, 139, Zoidberg, Really?
7, 139, Merchant, My name's Marianne.
7, 139, Zoidberg, Hello, you!
7, 139, Marianne, I like your dumpster.
7, 139, Zoidberg, Thank you. The previous tenant was a very prominent raccoon!
7, 139, Marianne, I remember. Too bad he got partially run over by that steamroller. Can I kiss you?
7, 139, Zoidberg, First, let me pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming! Ouch! I forgot I was a giant crab!
7, 139, Randy, Welcome, fans! I'm Randy, coordinator of this tap-dance-a-palooza.
7, 139, Fry, Woohoo! Ran-dy!
7, 139, Randy, After weeks of searching, I'm proud to introduce the five people willing to participate — Tonya... Bender... Greg... some kinda blob monster... and Petunia!
7, 139, Petunia, The extra clickin' you'll hear is gonna be my hip.
7, 139, Randy, F.Y.I.... this little lady has a heart condition. She's always stealing them! Also... she has a serious heart condition.
7, 139, Tonya, I'm six years old, and tap dancing is my favourest thing! Even if it's not good for my pacemaker...
7, 139, Audience, Aw...
7, 139, Bender, That is one quality pacemaker. The rest of you might as well give up now, 'cuz I'm gonna take home da— Hey. What's my grand prize gonna be?
7, 139, Randy, Oh. There is no prize, Dorothy. Unless you count the satisfaction of winning.
7, 139, Bender, It... will... be... mine!
7, 139, Hermes, In conclusion, bullying in the workplace in unacceptable... and will not be tolerated.
7, 139, Bender, Outta my way, fattie! I'm practisin'. Ta-da!
7, 139, Zoidberg, Friends! I'd like you to meet my new lady — Marianne!
7, 139, Fry, What's the catch? She looks normal.
7, 139, Amy, She's not a hologram.
7, 139, Professor Farnsworth, Not a robo-slave.
7, 139, Bender, We give up.
7, 139, Marianne, You guys are weird. I have to go open my flower stand, before the falafel guy takes my spot, but it was great to meet you. See ya later... crab cakes!
7, 139, Amy, Dr Zoidberg... She's great!
7, 139, Zoidberg, She's the best thing that ever happened to me. We had a wonderful night of love-making in my dumpster.
7, 139, Others, Ewwwwwww!
7, 139, Leela, I hope she used protection.
7, 139, Fry, Uh... No offense, Zoidberg, but... how is she not driven to madness by your mind-altering stench?
7, 139, Zoidberg, Because, my friends... she has no sense of smell!
7, 139, Others, Ohhhhhhh.
7, 139, Bender, That explained this.
7, 139, Amy, I get it.
7, 139, Zoidberg, For the first time in my life, I'm truly happy.
7, 139, Hermes, It's just too bad for her there's no cure, I assume.
7, 139, Professor Farnsworth, Ooh... but there is! A skilled surgeon could perform a nose transplant.
7, 139, Zoidberg, You're right! And I, as a renowned ear, nose, and blowhole doctor, could do the operation!
7, 139, Fry, Are you nuts?! If she could smell, she'd smell you! Your relationship would be over faster than you can say—
7, 139, Professor Farnsworth, Listen to Orange Joe. You must never let the girl know of this wonderful surgery!
7, 139, Zoidberg, I dunno. It doesn't seem fair to Marianne. But on the other claw... maybe I can't live without her! So you're right. I can never tell her.
7, 139, Leela, You're doing the right thing.
7, 139, Randy, Today the competition begins. Over the course of the summer, we'll be eliminating one contestant each week, and by "we" I mean "me". Deal with it, you babies! Let the battle begin!
7, 139, Randy, Okay! Before those pilates Nazis come goose-stepping in and take the room, here are the finalists for next week's championship! Bender... and Tonya!
7, 139, Tonya, I just wanna have fun, because dancing is fun, and I like dancing!
7, 139, Fry and Leela, Aw...
7, 139, Bender, I'm gonna kick your ass, little girl!
7, 139, Zoidberg, For you, my lovely rugelach.
7, 139, Marianne, Thank you! It's Gardenia imperialis. You can brew it into a tea, if you like severe stomach cramps.
7, 139, Zoidberg, Such a smart one! You know everything about flowers!
7, 139, Marianne, Everything but how they smell... Please. Describe it to me.
7, 139, Zoidberg, Uh... It's like summer... with a dab of vanilla and honey... or maybe winter with some gravy on it.
7, 139, Marianne, I'd give anything to be able to smell a flower like that.
7, 139, Zoidberg, Marianne, my love. I've never known anyone who wanted to smell so badly... and there's a way maybe you can.
7, 139, Marianne, Really?! How?
7, 139, Zoidberg, We have in the doctor world something called a nose transplant. I can give you a surgery, and when it's done... you'll be able to smell. Everything.
7, 139, Marianne, Oh, Zoidberg! I want the biggest nose you can find!
7, 139, Fry, Dude! You made the finals! Congrats!
7, 139, Leela, You've accomplished so much more than most of us would bother to.
7, 139, Bender, Yeah, but I'm not done yet. I got a full-proof plan to make sure I go home the champ!
7, 139, Fry, You're gonna put sequins on your hat?
7, 139, Bender, Pfffffff!See that locker? Tonya keeps her tap shoes in there, so right before she dances... I'll sneak in and put rusty tacks in them.  The harder she dances, the more she bleeds!
7, 139, Fry, Seems like a sold plan.
7, 139, Leela, What?! It's the most horrifying thing I've ever heard!
7, 139, Fry, That's true.
7, 139, Bender, Well, it gets worse. Once Tonya drops out due to blood loss, I kidnap her parents and make them watch... while I cut off her hair with these head's clippers!
7, 139, Leela, Don't you lay a hand on that angel!
7, 139, Bender, Angel?! I've looked into her eyes and seen her soul! She's a monster.
7, 139, Leela, You're insane! Come on, Fry. Let's go.
7, 139, Fry, Okay.See ya, Bender.
7, 139, Tonya, The championship's mine, robot.
7, 139, Bender, Why? Whyyyyy?! What did I not do yet to deserve this?!
7, 139, Amy, Aw... I think it's noble of you to give Marianne a new nose.
7, 139, Hermes, Yeah. She'll be forever grateful... from somewhere upwind.
7, 139, Zoidberg, True. Our relationship will end once she smells my odour. But you know what would really stink? If Marianne spent her whole life never knowing the beautiful scent of her own flowers.
7, 139, Bender, Dr Zoidberg! Help!
7, 139, Fry, Bender?! What happened to your leg tube?
7, 139, Bender, I got beat up by a little girl. Please. Fix my knee, so I can get revenge at the tap-dance championship!
7, 139, Zoidberg, I don't have time for this, robut. Here. Patch yourself up with this medicinal wacky pack.  It's time!
7, 139, Leela, I got a donor nose! There was an accident at the fencing academy.
7, 139, Fry, Touché!
7, 139, Zoidberg, It'll all be over soon, my love. May I have...  one last kiss?
7, 139, Marianne, Aw. There'll be lots more.
7, 139, Zoidberg, Yes. Lots.  Nurse Amy. The anesthesia.
7, 139, Marianne, Smell you later.
7, 139, Amy, She's out.
7, 139, Zoidberg, Then let's begin this delicate procedure.
7, 139, Randy, Okay, dance maniacs. Let's have a big hand for our finalists — cute, little Tonya... and mean, old what's-his-name!
7, 139, Tonya, Break a leg, Bender.  Oops! Looks like you already did!
7, 139, Bender, You are an evil, heartless trough... so actually... we have a lot in common. In another life, we could've been friends.
7, 139, Tonya, No chance, garbage-can face!
7, 139, Bender, Aw!
7, 139, Randy, Brace yourselves, 'cuz we're gonna try somethin' you would never see in mainstream tap — a simultaneous, head-to-head tap-off!
7, 139, Professor Farnsworth, Wha?!
7, 139, Mrs Astor, Scandalous!
7, 139, Randy, It's time for some fancy, shmancy dancy. Hit it, me!
7, 139, Bender, Ooooh!
7, 139, Fry, Ow! Bender!
7, 139, Randy, Ew! Look at him dance! He don't care.
7, 139, Tonya, Try this, pegleg.
7, 139, Bender, No sweat!
7, 139, Randy, Time's up, kittens. The judge has conferred and the vote is in. I pick her.
7, 139, Tonya, Thanks, Mister Nice Man. You know... the doctors say my heart doesn't work very good, but it feels good today, 'cuz I got to dance, and make people happy.
7, 139, Bender, I never knew I could hate this much!
7, 139, Leela, Bender! She's a sweet little girl!
7, 139, Bender, She's a pig! I'm gonna tap-dance on her grave some day!
7, 139, Leela, Ohhhhh!
7, 139, Tonya, This... is the bestestest day of my whole— Gah!
7, 139, Randy, Oh, my God, people! She's having a heart attack! A cute little heart attack!
7, 139, Dr Cahill, I'm a doctor, and yes. They're real. Clear!
7, 139, Marianne, How did it go?
7, 139, Zoidberg, Just perfect. This time, you can describe their beautiful aroma to me.
7, 139, Marianne, What is that horrible stench?
7, 139, Zoidberg, I don't know how to tell you this, but...
7, 139, Marianne, It's these flowers! Bluh-ah!
7, 139, Zoidberg, It's not the flowers. It's—
7, 139, Marianne, Much better. You smell just like I dreamed you would.
7, 139, Zoidberg, But but... But but... most people think I smell like a burning zoo!
7, 139, Marianne, I never learned a good smell from a bad smell, but I like the way you smell... because I like you.
7, 139, Amy, It's so beautiful!
7, 139, Dr Cahill, I'm sorry. She's gone.
7, 139, Bender, Woohoo! In your dead face, little girl! I'm not even gonna wait to dance on your grave. I'm gonna dance on your corpse, right now.
7, 139, Randy, Oh, my God!
7, 139, Fry, No, Bender! What're you doin'?! No!
7, 139, Leela, Bender! Stop!
7, 139, Randy, The robot has to go!
7, 139, Bender, Huh?! What's that?
7, 139, Tonya, I took a nappie!
7, 139, Dr Cahill, I don't believe it. She's alive! Bender's rhythmic chest compressions restarted her heart.
7, 139, Randy, He's a big ol' hero!
7, 139, Bender, No. I was... tryin'... Hey. Wait. I... Come on. What...
7, 139, Tonya, Just 'cuz you saved my life doesn't mean I won't beat you down again.
7, 139, Bender, Man. You are irredeemably evil. Together, we shall rule the galaxy!
7, 139, Hattie, Aw... What an adorable, little kajigger.
7, 139, Bender, Now!
7, 139, Zoidberg, Ah. Nothing like the first cup of dumpster juice in the morning. Marianne?!
7, 139, Marianne, Yes.Listen. I've got a new job, and... well... I'm going to have to dump you.
7, 139, Zoidberg, I'd like that!
7, 140, Bender, 
7, 140, Fry, Remember this place, Leela?
7, 140, Leela, Yep. The moon. It's been here for quite a while.
7, 140, Fry, Yeah, but it's also where we came on our very first delivery together.
7, 140, Leela, Oh, right. Man, we sure used to try harder back then.
7, 140, Craterface, Get your likeness in the form of a balloon sculpture! A cherished family keepsake for hours to come!
7, 140, Fry, One Leela, please. And use your finest balloons.
7, 140, Leela, Wow! You're good!
7, 140, Craterface, Five years of art school.
7, 140, Bender, Want a corndog?
7, 140, Albert, Sure!
7, 140, Bender, Then your mom shoulda bought you one!
7, 140, Carnie, Hold tight! The Mecha-Hexadecapus is about to flail erratically into action!
7, 140, Bender, Y'know, I'm feelin' a little... BLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEGGGHHH... BLLLEEEEEEEEEEGGGGGGHHH....... BLLEEEEEEEEGGGGH....
7, 140, Leela, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!
7, 140, Fry, LEELA!!!
7, 140, Fry, Poor Leela! I never even told her I loved her!
7, 140, Bender, What?! You told her like 140 times!!
7, 140, Fry, Yeah, but she paid very little attention to me. Oh, Bender, I always thought me and her would...grow old together.
7, 140, Bender, You gotta live in the moment, baby! And this moment, Leela's dead.
7, 140, Moon Patrolman #1, Sir, we have some good news and some bad news. The good news is we found your stuffed animal.
7, 140, Fry, What's the bad news?
7, 140, Moon Patrolman #1, Your wife is dead.
7, 140, Fry, She wasn't my wife!
7, 140, Moon Patrolman #1, Oh. Then there is no bad news.
7, 140, Fry, Leela! You're alive!!
7, 140, Leela, She gave her life to save mine!
7, 140, Fry, Bender, can I come in and talk?
7, 140, Bender, I'm kinda busy!
7, 140, Fry, Seeing Leela fly off the Hexadecapus and crash through the moon dome and survive inside a stuffed animal by breathing a balloon was a dose of reality.
7, 140, Bender, Come in!
7, 140, Fry, All this time, I've been wondering if I can spend my life with her, but what I realize now is I can't spend my life without her! So tomorrow, I'm asking her to marry me!
7, 140, Bender, Uh-huh. Good talk. We're done here.  My little meatbag's growin' up!
7, 140, Hermes, Computer, Jamaican joy juice! Hot!
7, 140, Farnsworth, GN, E!  Behold, the time button! A pocket-sized device that sends the entire universe 10 seconds into the past! I will now demonstrate.
7, 140, Hermes, ...joy juice! Hot!
7, 140, Farnsworth, Pretty cool, eh? I'm over here, where I was 10 seconds ago!
7, 140, Amy, Something's cool? Show it to us!
7, 140, Farnsworth, Eh, wha? Oh, right! You were outside the button ball, so you don't remember a thing I said. Let's try again. But this time, everyone cram into my time shelter.
7, 140, Bender, Oooh!
7, 140, Fry, Whoa!
7, 140, Leela, Nice!
7, 140, Farnsworth, It's coated with anti-chroniton-resistant grout, to shield you from the effects of the button. Come on! Get in! Hurry up!
7, 140, Zoidberg, Friends, I found a ten dollars!
7, 140, Farnsworth, Ten dollars, you say? Let me see.
7, 140, Zoidberg, It fell off a man. The man got into a taxi. But the money did not.  Friends, I found a ten dollars!
7, 140, Farnsworth, You found some money? Show me!
7, 140, Zoidberg, Awwww...
7, 140, Farnsworth, Say, check out the money I found! It fell off a chump!
7, 140, Leela, Hey, Professor, couldn't you go back in time as far as you want by pressing the button over and over?
7, 140, Farnsworth, Certainly not! Each time the button sends you back 10 seconds, it takes 10 seconds to recharge!  There. It's recharged.
7, 140, Zoidberg, Awwww...
7, 140, Bender, Again! Again!
7, 140, Fry, Uh, question. What if you had a special moment that you wish could go on forever? Could the time button make it last as long as you wanted?
7, 140, Farnsworth, Hell no! This button is for scientific use only!
7, 140, Zoidberg, Awwww...
7, 140, Fry, Uh, yes, I'd like an engagement diamond, please.
7, 140, Ultra Guy, You've come to the right joint, Ace!
7, 140, Fry, I'll take...this one.
7, 140, Ultra Guy, Classy choice, chief! She'll crap her pants!  That'll be five bills.  Hey, gimme back my stones!
7, 140, Fry, Hello, stranger! This is my first time here! Do you sell diamonds?
7, 140, Ultra Guy, You've come to the right joint, Ace!
7, 140, Fry, I guess what I'm saying is, the next time you almost die, I want it to be as my wife!  The clam, Elzar.
7, 140, Elzar, Clam, bam, thank you, ma'am!
7, 140, Leela, Fry?  Wow!
7, 140, Fry, Leela...my love... will you—
7, 140, Leela, AAAAAAHHHH!!!
7, 140, Petunia, I'll have what she's havin'.
