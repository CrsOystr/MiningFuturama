3, 33, "Hermes", "People, we got a problem"
3, 33, "Leela", "Well, so has Fry. What's the big deal?"
3, 33, "Fry", "He's got me beat!"
3, 33, "Hermes", "Now we all love Nibbler, so it's only fair that we all pitch in and clean it up together. Still, I propose we make Zoidberg do it. All in favour?"
3, 33, "Leela", "Yeah!"
3, 33, "Bender", "Alright, yup."
3, 33, "Hermes", "All opposed?  All abstaining?"
3, 33, "Leela", "Dr. Zoidberg? Are you OK?"
3, 33, "Fry", "He's dead."
3, 33, "Bender", "What?"
3, 33, "Amy", "Oh, no!"
3, 33, "Farnsworth", "He always seemed so full of life; laughing, singing, begging for scraps. And now this."
3, 33, "Zoidberg", "Why with all the crying?  So that's where I left my shell."
3, 33, "Leela", "I didn't know you could take this thing off."
3, 33, "Zoidberg", "It was starting to get a little cramped in there so I molted, why not? Ah, the fresh air feels good!"
3, 33, "Farnsworth", "Stop doing that!"
3, 33, "Zoidberg", "So long. I'm off to toss this old shell in the dumpster and maybe pick up those potato chips Amy didn't finish yesterday."
3, 33, "Amy", "Those were toenail clippings."
3, 33, "Zoidberg", "A feast is a feast."
3, 33, "Amy", "Hey, that's my cellphone!"
3, 33, "Amy", "Hello?  Hello? Who is this?  Hello? Hello?"
3, 33, "Leela", "What's wrong? Did you swallow your phone again?"
3, 33, "Amy", "Some guy's been calling and hanging up 10 times a day for a year."
3, 33, "Leela", "Men who call too much are the worst ... I bet."
3, 33, "Amy", "I just wish a decent guy would call me instead of this spleeze-ball who has me too terrified to even answer the phone.  Hello?"
3, 33, "Amy", "Hello? Is anyone there?"
3, 33, "Kif", "I love you.  Why must I be such a coward?"
3, 33, "Zapp", "Kif, I'm headed to the men's room and I'll be needing an attendant, so-- Oh, I'm sorry. You're crying like a woman.  It's alright. I've always thought myself as a father figure to some of my more pathetic men. Kif, old friend, let's rap."
3, 33, "Kif", "Well, I'm in love with this girl--"
3, 33, "Zapp", "Oh, that's rich!  Go on."
3, 33, "Kif", "I met her a year ago..."
3, 33, "Kif", "...when we were escaping from that cruise ship you piloted directly into a black hole."
3, 33, "Zapp", "Yes! It was in all the papers."
3, 33, "Amy", "Call me."
3, 33, "Zapp", "Uh-huh, uh-huh. Mm-hmm, uh-huh."
3, 33, "Kif", "I've finished talking, sir."
3, 33, "Zapp", "Belay that remark!  Your Amy knows my Leela? I have formed an idea!"
3, 33, "Zapp", "I'm calling to negotiate a double date. You and me, Kif and Amy."
3, 33, "Leela", "Forget it."
3, 33, "Zapp", "Then let the negotiations begin. I propose we go out on 10 dates."
3, 33, "Leela", "How about zero?"
3, 33, "Zapp", "Nine."
3, 33, "Leela", "Zero."
3, 33, "Zapp", "Seven."
3, 33, "Leela", "Zero."
3, 33, "Zapp", "Eight?"
3, 33, "Amy", "Please, Leela? Kif's like the sweetest guy who's ever liked me."
3, 33, "Zapp", "Five, and that's my final offer ... four."
3, 33, "Leela", "One."
3, 33, "Zapp", "Two."
3, 33, "Leela", "One half."
3, 33, "Zapp", "I'll take it."
3, 33, "Zapp", "We'll meet you tonight for part of dinner and the first half of a movie."
3, 33, "Kif", "Um, sir? I don't go out on many dates and, um, what if I can't think of anything to say?"
3, 33, "Zapp", "Here's my personal book of pickup lines.  Say as many of them as you can as fast as you can. Don't stop for any reason."
3, 33, "Kif", "Maybe I'll just give her these flowers."
3, 33, "Zapp", "Wrong, wrong, wrong! And what's that? Candy? Candy's for dorks! Give me that.  Mmm!"
3, 33, "Zapp", "Hello, beautiful. I got these for you."
3, 33, "Leela", "Thanks."
3, 33, "Zapp", "Well, well. This looks to be one disturbingly erotic date."
3, 33, "Leela", "Half-date."
3, 33, "Zapp", "Waiter, bring us a bottle of wine."
3, 33, "Leela", "Half-bottle."
3, 33, "Zapp", "And some oysters on the half-shell."
3, 33, "Leela", "Quarter-shell."
3, 33, "Kif", "Oh, and I'd like--"
3, 33, "Zapp", "Kif's not hungry.  Kif, this place is expensive.  I'd like two steaks and the ladies will have some very sensual salads -- with low-cal sensual dressing."
3, 33, "Morbo", "Oh, won't you take me to funkytown,Oh, won't you take me to funkytown.(talking) Thank you."
3, 33, "Amy", "Kif, you're so quiet. You haven't said a word all night."
3, 33, "Kif", "Well, um, um ... hello."
3, 33, "Amy", "'Cause I was really hoping we could talk and stuff."
3, 33, "Kif", "Amy,  if I said you had a beautiful body would you take your pants off and dance around a little?"
3, 33, "Amy", "What?"
3, 33, "Leela", "Lieutenant Kroker!"
3, 33, "Kif", "I find the most erotic part of the woman is the boobies"
3, 33, "Amy", "Kif!"
3, 33, "Kif", "Oh, my!"
3, 33, "Leela", "This half-date is entirely over. Amy? Conference!"
3, 33, "Kif", "Is there nothing we can do, sir?"
3, 33, "Zapp", "There's only one sure-fire way back into a woman's heart and parts beyond. I speak, of course, of karaoke."
3, 33, "Kif", "My years in the DOOP Boys' Chorus will not have been in vain!"
3, 33, "Leela", "Alright, enough lipstick. Let's storm out."
3, 33, "Kif", "Once upon a time I was falling in love,But now I'm only falling apart..."
3, 33, "Amy", "Oh, that's so emotional!"
3, 33, "Kif", "There's nothing I can do,A total eclipse of the heart--"
3, 33, "Zapp", "Amateur hour's over.  Let me show you why they call me ""The Velour Fog""! Hit it!(spoken-word) I met her in a club down in old Soho,Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like Coca-Cola,C-O-L-A ... Cola."
3, 33, "Man", "Aw, give us a break!"
3, 33, "Woman", "Get off!"
3, 33, "Chef", "He sickens me!"
3, 33, "Zapp", "She walked up to me and she asked me to dance,I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said,(singing) Leela!L-E-E-L-A, Leela!Lee-Lee-Lee-Lee-Leela!Ba-ba-ba-dum-ba-dum-bum!Leela!"
3, 33, "Leela", "We're going home. Call us a space taxi."
3, 33, "Zapp", "No need. There's not a restaurant built I can't fly. Where to, ladies?"
3, 33, "Kif", "Please, sir. Let's just divide up the check and--"
3, 33, "Zapp", "Let's see what this eatery can do."
3, 33, "Zapp", "Ah, she's built like a steakhouse, but she handles like a bistro.  She's out of control!"
3, 33, "Zapp", "You win again, gravity!"
3, 33, "Zoidberg", "Look what arrived"
3, 33, "Bender", "Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm Mexican and I find that offensive."
3, 33, "Zoidberg", "You Latins are so hot-blooded!  This one's like a summer guy!"
3, 33, "Hermes", "Look, you fat fish, the Planet Express health plan only covers one kind of replacement shell."
3, 33, "Fry", "I can't believe Leela and Amy aren't back yet from their half-date. I'm gonna call the restaurant."
3, 33, "Operator", "The number you have dialled has crashed into a planet. Please make a note of it."
3, 33, "Fry", "We gotta go rescue them!"
3, 33, "Bender", "Eh, I don't know."
3, 33, "Fry", "Bender! Think of the señoritas!"
3, 33, "Bender", "Vámonos!"
3, 33, "Kif", "So, Amy, um, well--"
3, 33, "Amy", "It's always a line with you!"
3, 33, "Leela", "What planet is this anyway?"
3, 33, "Zapp", "I 'unno.  This whole sector is uncharted."
3, 33, "Kif", "It is not uncharted, you lost the chart!"
3, 33, "Zapp", "Well, nothing to do now but repopulate the human race.  Just me and you!   And maybe you."
3, 33, "Amy", "What is it?"
3, 33, "Kug", "Me hear people, but me not see people."
3, 33, "Thog", "No big deal. Everybody make mistake."
3, 33, "Zapp", "Well, hello! I usually don't say this but you are the most beautiful trio of gigantic ladies I've ever laid eyes on.   I find the most erotic part of a woman is the boo--"
3, 33, "Fry", "Oh, no! Any sign of Leela or Amy?"
3, 33, "Bender", "No. But what do you make of this?"
3, 33, "Fry", "I don't know. But it might have something to do with this."
3, 33, "Bender", "Oh, your God!"
3, 33, "Kug", "Move! Go!"
3, 33, "Fry", "Alright, here's the plan--"
3, 33, "Bender", "What kind of moronic plan is that?  Wow!"
3, 33, "Thog", "Women go free. Men stay in chains."
3, 33, "Ornik", "We take them to our leader. She know what do."
3, 33, "Fry", "Pft. A female leader?"
3, 33, "Leela", "Fry, shut up."
3, 33, "Fry", "Yes, Captain!"
3, 33, "Thog", "This capital city planet Amazonia."
3, 33, "Leela", "Where are all the men in your society?"
3, 33, "Ornik", "Men die out many year ago."
3, 33, "Bender", "With all these women around they were probably nagged to death. Are you with me, fellas?"
3, 33, "Thog", "Here stadium, where our women basketball teams play."
3, 33, "Kug", "We no can dunk, but good fundamentals."
3, 33, "Ornik", "That more fun to watch."
3, 33, "Zapp", "Oh, God, you're killing me!  Ow! God, you're killing me!"
3, 33, "Thog", "This our comedy club. Humour here funny in different way."
3, 33, "Ornik", "It not reinforce stereotypes."
3, 33, "Kug", "Comedy come from character, real situations. Not abstract craziness."
3, 33, "Bender", "Translation"
3, 33, "Amy", "This women-only planet is sounding better and better."
3, 33, "Leela", "I'm already looking for apartments."
3, 33, "Thog", "Here live vengeful, all-knowing leader. She decide men's fate."
3, 33, "Fry", "Is she hot?"
3, 33, "Thog", "That not important. She all-knowing."
3, 33, "Fry", "In other words, ""No"".  Ow!"
3, 33, "Thog", "All hail Femputer."
3, 33, "Kug", "and   All hail Femputer."
3, 33, "Amy", "You all obey a big computer?"
3, 33, "Kug", "Yes. It appear mysteriously just about time men die out."
3, 33, "Leela", "So why did you make it your leader?"
3, 33, "Ornik", "It seemed like different kind of politician."
3, 33, "Kug", "Not beltway insider."
3, 33, "Thog", "Femputer, we bring offering of bath beads and scented soaps."
3, 33, "Femputer", "Your gift pleases Femputer. Femputer demands to know why there are men on her planet."
3, 33, "Fry", "It was an accident, ma'am."
3, 33, "Femputer", "That does not fempute. Femputer will return after deciding your punishment."
3, 33, "Fry", "Leela, I'm through making fun of women. Now I want them to help me."
3, 33, "Amy", "Should we do something?"
3, 33, "Leela", "There's no hurry."
3, 33, "Zapp", "Yes! A little tighter.  Tighter. Perhaps a hard spanking is in order?  Too hard!"
3, 33, "Kug", "Men strange. You have them on your planet?"
3, 33, "Leela", "I'm afraid so."
3, 33, "Kug", "What they for?  Oh, you mean ""snu-snu""."
3, 33, "Thog", "We hear tell men used for snu-snu. But all we have go on are ancient legend and subscription to Cosmo."
3, 33, "Zapp", "Just FYI, I could be used for snu-snu."
3, 33, "Thog", "Silence. You want die like last men visit Amazonia?"
3, 33, "Fry", "What'd they die of?"
3, 33, "Kug", "Crushed pelvises."
3, 33, "Fry", "Yes!"
3, 33, "Zapp", "Oh, thank you, Lord in heaven!"
3, 33, "Femputer", "After lengthy femputations, I, Femputer, have decided the fate of the men. Femputer sentences them to death.  By snu-snu!"
3, 33, "Fry", "Yay!"
3, 33, "Zapp", "Yeah!   What are you, gay?"
3, 33, "Femputer", "Death to the men. Death by snu-snu."
3, 33, "Fry", "Although the snu-snu part's gonna be pretty good."
3, 33, "Zapp", "Baby, it'll blow your mind."
3, 33, "Leela", "Femputer, be reasonable. Sure men are annoying and they wreck up whatever planet they're in charge of, but most of these men are sorta my friends. They don't deserve to die."
3, 33, "Femputer", "Hmm. Perhaps men are not as evil as Femputer thinks."
3, 33, "Thog", "But they make fun women's basketball."
3, 33, "Femputer", "What? Did you explain how the women's good fundamentals make up for their inability to dunk?"
3, 33, "Ornik", "Yes. They still laugh."
3, 33, "Femputer", "The men must die."
3, 33, "Bender", "Too true, Femputer. You're so wise. Kill 'em all, I say. Good riddance! Did I mention I'm not a man? I'm a manbot. It's an understandable mistake. You can let me down now, thanks."
3, 33, "Kug", "He big jerk like man."
3, 33, "Bender", "I sure am. But check the crotch.  Nothing."
3, 33, "Femputer", "Very well, release him. As for the others, take them to the snu-snu chambers."
3, 33, "Bender", "I'll miss you, meatbag."
3, 33, "Leela", "Me too, meatbag."
3, 33, "Fry", "Goodbye, friends. I never thought I would die like this. But I'd always really hoped."
3, 33, "Femputer", "The Amazonians will be divided into three groups. The one called ""Zapp"" will be snu-snu'd by the large women. He that is designated ""Fry"" will be snu-snu'd by the petite women. And Kif, as the most attractive male, will be snu-snu'd by the most beautiful women of Amazonia. Then the large women. Then the petite women. Then the large women again.  Initiate snu-snu!"
3, 33, "Amazonians", "Snu-snu, snu-snu, snu-snu!"
3, 33, "Kif", "Amy, before I die, I have to tell you"
3, 33, "Amy", "Really? Honest and true?"
3, 33, "Kif", "Yes. And-And that person calling and hanging up was me. I was just too nervous to say hello because I love you."
3, 33, "Amy", "Oh, Kif!"
3, 33, "Thog", "It Thog's first time.  Be gentle!"
3, 33, "Leela", "We've got to do something. Bender, maybe you can interface with the Femputer and reprogram it to let them go."
3, 33, "Bender", "Maybe you can interface with my ass. By biting it!  Alright, I'll go!"
3, 33, "Fry", "Ooh! Yeah!"
3, 33, "Zapp", "Oh, baby!"
3, 33, "Guard #1", "How Tonk look?"
3, 33, "Guard #2", "Tonk look good. Me fat."
3, 33, "Guard #1", "No, you look good. Tonk fat."
3, 33, "Femputer", "Intruder! Stay away from the mighty Femputer! Guards!"
3, 33, "Bender", "Time to override the CPU and reprogram this Femputer."
3, 33, "Femputer", "Hey, whoa, whoa! Stop it! Stop it! Hey, cut that out!"
3, 33, "Fembot", "Cease hitting Femputer!"
3, 33, "Bender", "You're no Femputer, you're a Fembot!"
3, 33, "Fembot", "It's true. I disguised myself as a Femputer so I could rule the Amazonians."
3, 33, "Bender", "But why?"
3, 33, "Fembot", "Why? Why? I came here from a faraway planet. A planet ruled by a chauvinistic Manputer that was really a Manbot. Have you any idea how it feels to be a Fembot living in a Manbot's Manputer's world?"
3, 33, "Bender", "What?"
3, 33, "Fembot", "And now, my meddling Manbot, there's the question of what to do with you!"
3, 33, "Zapp", "We need rest. The spirit is willing but the flesh is spongy and bruised."
3, 33, "Ornik", "It time snu-snu!"
3, 33, "Fry", "Can't we just cuddle?   Nooo!"
3, 33, "Leela", "We can't wait for Bender. It's time for a woman's touch.  Yah! Hi-yah! Yah, yah, yah!"
3, 33, "Amy", "Me next snu-snu. Out me way."
3, 33, "Thog", "Where go beautiful man?  Me want snu-snu!"
3, 33, "Amy", "Kif! Jump!"
3, 33, "Kif", "My hero!"
3, 33, "Thog", "Me not get snu-snu! Get him!"
3, 33, "Thog", "Mighty Femputer. Small girl steal green kissy man. We kill her now?"
3, 33, "Fembot", "Come back later. Leave me alone."
3, 33, "Bender", "Yeah, get lost!   Ooh! I'm a scary Femputer. Release the prisoners!   And bring gold. Lots of gold."
3, 33, "Thog", "Gold? Why Femputer want gold?"
3, 33, "Fembot", "You heard the man."
3, 33, "Bender", "C'mon! Gimme some of that!"
3, 33, "Zoidberg", "And that's how I got my new shell. It looks just like the shell I threw out yesterday and I found it in the same dumpster, but this one had a live raccoon inside.  Pretty good story, eh, Hermes?"
3, 33, "Hermes", "Stick to someone else, you windy barnacle!"
3, 33, "Leela", "It's funny how the battle of the sexes was only resolved when a Manbot and a Fembot realised they loved each other."
3, 33, "Bender", "Yeah. By the way, if she calls, I'm not here. All I know is this gold says that was the best mission ever!"
3, 33, "Amy", "It sure was."
3, 33, "Fry", "Oh, yeah!"
3, 33, "Zapp", "I had snu-snu!"
3, 33, "Kif", "So, um, Amy, w-what do you wanna do now?"
3, 34, "Man #1", "Breaker-breaker, this here's the Duck. Uh, you wanna back off them hogs?"
3, 34, "Man #1", "Ten-four, five miles or so."
3, 34, "Man #2", "Ten, roger!"
3, 34, "Leela", "Hmm, I'd better check the fluid levels.   We're OK on Coke syrup."
3, 34, "Bender", "Oh, man! Come on!  Comin' through!"
3, 34, "Bender", "What's that black cracker?"
3, 34, "Fry", "A tomato."
3, 34, "Leela", "You're not gonna eat a sandwich from a truck stop men's room are you?"
3, 34, "Fry", "Eh, what's the worst thing that could happen?  Ugh! It's like a party in my mouth and everyone's throwing up!"
3, 34, "Trucker", "Lookie there! It's one of them things like on our mud flaps!"
3, 34, "Hoschel", "Yosemite Sam?"
3, 34, "Sal", "Stands back! I'm gonna puts my moves on her.  Whoas!"
3, 34, "Fry", "That jerk! No one hoots at my captain unless they're prepared to take it to the next level!"
3, 34, "Leela", "Fry, please. That's sweet but I'd rather not even dignify them with an ass-whooping!"
3, 34, "Sal", "Hey, sexy mama, let's get busy and freaky in that order!"
3, 34, "Fry", "Hey, jumbo! How would you like it if Leela said you were sexy and she wanted to make love with you?"
3, 34, "Sal", "Eh, I gots five minutes. She looks pretty good for a truck stop chick!"
3, 34, "Fry", "You take that back! She does not look good for a truck stop chick!"
3, 34, "Sal", "Yeah, you're right. She don't gots enough meat for a guy like me."
3, 34, "Fry", "She does too! She's loaded with meat! She's got more meat than a cow!  Ow!"
3, 34, "Sal", "More meat than a cow!"
3, 34, "Fry", "I can't please Leela no matter what I do. I just want her to like me."
3, 34, "Bender", "Well there's always hope.  C'mon, we gotta go fix the plasma fusion boiler."
3, 34, "Bender", "Who are you?"
3, 34, "Scruffy", "Scruffy. The janitor."
3, 34, "Bender", "Well why aren't you fixing the boiler?"
3, 34, "Scruffy", "Schedule conflict."
3, 34, "Bender", "There! Fixed forever."
3, 34, "Scruffy", "Scruffy's gonna die the way he lived.  Oh, marmalade!"
3, 34, "Zoidberg", "Oh, the hypochondriac's back! So what is it this time?"
3, 34, "Fry", "Well, my lead pipe hurts a little."
3, 34, "Zoidberg", "That's normal. Next patient."
3, 34, "Bender", "He's a witch!"
3, 34, "Farnsworth", "Fry, did you eat anything unusual recently?"
3, 34, "Fry", "No."
3, 34, "Leela", "What about that bathroom egg salad from the truck stop?"
3, 34, "Fry", "I've had better."
3, 34, "Farnsworth", "Egg salad? Hmm. Zoidberg will have to examine your gastrointestinal tract. Come, everyone. Give Fry some privacy."
3, 34, "Farnsworth", "If you can't see well enough through the two-way mirror, there'll be a close-up on this video screen."
3, 34, "Zoidberg", "Hmm. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.  Guess again."
3, 34, "Amy", "Gross!"
3, 34, "Bender", "Go, man! Go!"
3, 34, "Farnsworth", "Watch for any subtle irregularity in Fry's bowel."
3, 34, "Amy", "It's gorgeous. That place used to be a big dump."
3, 34, "Bender", "Oh! Ew!"
3, 34, "Amy", "Worms? Ew! Puke-a-tronic!"
3, 34, "Leela", "So the eggs in that egg salad sandwich were--"
3, 34, "Farnsworth", "Correct! Worm eggs! And the mayonnaise was probably none too fresh either."
3, 34, "Hermes", "It's nauseating, mon!  Is there no way to get rid of the disgusting maggots?"
3, 34, "Farnsworth", "Only one. We'll have to travel deep inside Fry, in this!"
3, 34, "Bender", "Shotgun!"
3, 34, "Zoidberg", "Shotgun!"
3, 34, "Farnsworth", "In each gastro-survival kit, you'll find a rain slicker, a disposable fun camera, and something to protect you against bacteria -- a harpoon!"
3, 34, "Bender", "Yo, old guy, why do we have to use those tiny micro-droids? Can't you just shrink us?"
3, 34, "Farnsworth", "Oh, my, no. That would require extremely tiny atoms, and have you priced those lately? I'm not made of money! Leave me alone!"
3, 34, "Zoidberg", "Me next!"
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "Anyhoo, your net suits will let you experience Fry's worm-infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them."
3, 34, "Zoidberg-Droid", "There's no part of that sentence I didn't like."
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "Is everyone present?"
3, 34, "Amy-Droid", "Right on!"
3, 34, "Bender-Droid", "Uh-huh."
3, 34, "Hermes-Droid", "Definitely."
3, 34, "Zoidberg-Droid", "Yes."
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "Here's the plan"
3, 34, "Bender-Droid", "I'll tell Fry to wash out, among other things, his ear."
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "No! Fry can't know anything about the mission. If he finds out, the worms will try to defend themselves. They know everything he knows."
3, 34, "Bender-Droid", "They know how to make ice cream soup?"
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "Leela, your role is to distract Fry so he doesn't notice what we're up to."
3, 34, "Leela", "Can do!"
3, 34, "Amy-Droid", "Leela, you should really try a facial scrub, for your pores."
3, 34, "Leela", "Look! A starling!"
3, 34, "Fry", "Really?"
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "Sh! Be very quiet. We're in the ear."
3, 34, "Amy-Droid", "OK, Professor."
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "What?"
3, 34, "Fry", "What about what?"
3, 34, "Leela", "Uh ... what if we go for a walk, possibly, because it's such a lovely day, perhaps."
3, 34, "Fry", "I'd love to!"
3, 34, "Hermes-Droid", "We gotta get someplace where he won't stick his finger!"
3, 34, "Bender-Droid", "It's hopeless! Abandon ship!"
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "Wait! We just have to get past the eardrum."
3, 34, "Hermes-Droid", "What are those worms doing to Fry's brain?"
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "They're giving it a complete tune-up. A cursory glance would suggest they've doubled his thinking power."
3, 34, "Hermes-Droid", "My God! Soon he'll be smarter than Cher!"
3, 34, "Fry", "Ah, the scent of a rose. Curious how an aromatic chain of hydrocarbons can evoke our deepest emotions.  For you."
3, 34, "Leela", "That's such a beautiful thought, Fry. And what's more amazing, you expressed it without spewing crumbs at me."
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "Brace yourselves, everyone. We're entering the interior of Fry's nose."
3, 34, "Bender-Droid", "We're at finger alert five."
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "Let's just pray nothing stimulates the delicate smell receptors.  Nobody make a smell."
3, 34, "Zoidberg-Droid", "Quick! We can escape through that nasal capillary into the sinus."
3, 34, "Hermes-Droid", "Strange. Usually you don't know anything about human anatomy."
3, 34, "Zoidberg-Droid", "I learned it from a decongestant commercial.  ""Soothing action, action, action, action..."""
3, 34, "Bender-Droid", "Where are we? The ass?"
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "We're in the heart. Better known as ""The Love Muscle""."
3, 34, "Zoidberg-Droid", "Where the food is digested."
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "We should be safe, just so long as nothing makes it beat faster."
3, 34, "Bender-Droid", "Abandon ship!"
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "No! Set course for that cholesterol-encrusted valve."
3, 34, "Zoidberg-Droid", "It's good cholesterol but it spreads like bad cholesterol!"
3, 34, "Amy-Droid", "Look! They're jazz-ercising Fry's muscles!"
3, 34, "Hermes-Droid", "He'll be as strong and flexible as Gumby and Hercules combined!"
3, 34, "Zoidberg-Droid", "Gumbercules? I love that guy!"
3, 34, "Leela", "It's that jerk from the truck stop!  Let's cross the street and try to blend in with that crowd of pimps."
3, 34, "Fry", "I don't think so.  Sir, I believe you owe this lady an apology."
3, 34, "Leela", "Fry, no! He's bulging with what could be muscles.  Ooh!"
3, 34, "Sal", "I gots your apologys right heres!  Sorrys, ma'am. I've learnsed a lesson about not ogling cans that I won't soons forgets."
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "Ah, the stomach"
3, 34, "Bender-Droid", "Abandon ship!"
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "No! Don't give up now! We're but a stone's throw from the pyloric sphincter."
3, 34, "Bender-Droid", "Hooray!"
3, 34, "Zoidberg-Droid", "Hooray!"
3, 34, "Hermes-Droid", "We made it!"
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "There it is! The stately capitol of Fry's bowel. A heavily-guarded fortress surrounding the pelvic splanchnic ganglion."
3, 34, "Zoidberg-Droid", "I've heard of that! Who said I haven't?"
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "If we can stimulate that nerve, the bowel will convulse, expelling the entire worm society."
3, 34, "Hermes-Droid", "But what about the worms in the other parts of his body?"
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "Listen, this is gonna be one hell of a bowel movement. Afterwards he'll be lucky if he has any bones left!"
3, 34, "Bender-Droid", "Alright, let's mush some worms!"
3, 34, "Worm Mayor", "Worms to battle stations!"
3, 34, "Leela", "I had a great time today. The flowers, the puddle, the way you hurt that guy. But can I aks you something?"
3, 34, "Fry", "Anything."
3, 34, "Leela", "Why did you do all that stuff?"
3, 34, "Fry", "Leela, there's something I've wanted to tell you for a long time but every time I try I get nervous and my mouth feels like it's stuffed with peanut butter, even when it's not."
3, 34, "Leela", "What is it? Is it about Bender?"
3, 34, "Fry", "No, it's about you and me."
3, 34, "Leela", "And Bender?"
3, 34, "Fry", "Bender's not involved.  Leela ... I love you."
3, 34, "Leela", "You do?"
3, 34, "Fry", "Yes. But it's only recently that I've been able to articulate my thoughts. I love you, Leela, and I always have."
3, 34, "Leela", "Fry, that's the sweetest, most wonderful-- Wait! Recently? Like since you ate that toilet sandwich?"
3, 34, "Fry", "Yeah! I don't know why but my life really turned around that day."
3, 34, "Leela", "Stay here."
3, 34, "Waitress", "Freshen your noc-a-tina?"
3, 34, "Fry", "Please.  I need something to settle my stomach."
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "The nerve is through here. Where's Zoidberg?"
3, 34, "Zoidberg-Droid", "Yippie-ki-yay! You'll never guess where I've been!"
3, 34, "Bender-Droid", "One! Two! Three!"
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "There it is! The pelvic splanchnic ganglion.  Tickle it and get ready for the ride of your lives!"
3, 34, "Leela-Droid", "Don't even think about tickling that ganglion!"
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "Leela, you're just in time to help. If we don't get rid of the worms now, they'll burrow so deep into the bowel that not even Hermes' famous jerk prunes could dislodge them!"
3, 34, "Hermes-Droid", "I call it ""Caribbean Drain-o""!"
3, 34, "Farnsworth-Droid", "Fry will be stuck with the worms forever."
3, 34, "Leela-Droid", "Perfect."
3, 34, "Zoidberg-Droid", "Ouch!"
3, 34, "Amy", "I'm OK."
3, 34, "Farnsworth", "Leela, you ignorant dope! Now the worms will be in Fry forever."
3, 34, "Leela", "So? Did you ever stop to think that Fry is better off with worms?"
3, 34, "Farnsworth", "Oh, that's stupid!"
3, 34, "Fry", "If anyone wants to tell me what's going on here, I'll be in the lounge."
3, 34, "Fry", "Of all the parasites I've had over the years, these worms are among the-- Hell! They are the best! Leela, how can I ever repay you for saving them?"
3, 34, "Leela", "I'll think of something."
3, 34, "Bender", "'Ello! What's all this then?"
3, 34, "Fry", "Apartment 1I. The old me would have made a joke about that!"
3, 34, "Leela", "I should warn you, it's a little under-furnished."
3, 34, "Leela", "I'm thinking of having a window installed."
3, 34, "Fry", "I think the view's perfect already!"
3, 34, "Leela", "Oh, that's the corniest thing I've ever heard! Let me show you the bedroom."
3, 34, "Fry", "Wait. In a minute."
3, 34, "Leela", "A holophonor? Only a few people in the whole universe can play that, and they're not very good at it."
3, 34, "Fry", "They don't have you to inspire them."
3, 34, "Leela", "I don't have words to say how wonderful you are, Fry. I haven't felt this happy since double-soup Tuesday at the orphanarium."
3, 34, "Fry", "When I'm with you, every day seems like double-soup Tuesday."
3, 34, "Leela", "Oh, Fry! I love what you've become."
3, 34, "Fry", "What I've become."
3, 34, "Leela", "What is it?"
3, 34, "Fry", "There's just something I have to find out."
3, 34, "Fry-Droid", "Who controls this bowel?"
3, 34, "Worm Guard #1", "Who wants to know?"
3, 34, "Worm Mayor", "I am the Lord Mayor of Cologne."
3, 34, "Fry-Droid", "You mean ""colon""?"
3, 34, "Worm Mayor", "State your business!"
3, 34, "Fry-Droid", "Your Excellency, have you ever been in love?"
3, 34, "Worm Mayor", "No. I thought I was once but then I remember our species reproduces with a cloud of spores."
3, 34, "Fry-Droid", "Well, a wonderful girl loves me. But I need to know if it's really me she loves, or just what you worms have made of me. That's why, with all due respect, I'm asking you to leave."
3, 34, "Worm Mayor", "Listen, you"
3, 34, "Fry-Droid", "Everyone out of my body or the brain gets it!"
3, 34, "Worm Mayor", "He's bluffing! No creature would willingly make an idiot out of itself."
3, 34, "Fry-Droid", "Obviously you've never been in love!  Ow! Ow! Ow!  Now, the hand-eye co-ordination lobe."
3, 34, "Worm Guard #1", "Stop it, man!"
3, 34, "Worm Mayor", "You've damaged your brain, Universe, but no more than a week of binge drinking or five minutes on a cell phone."
3, 34, "Fry-Droid", "I was just working my way towards the medulla oblongata, control centre of the heart and lungs. And if I kill myself, you die with me."
3, 34, "Worm Guard #2", "Wait a minute, man!"
3, 34, "Fry-Droid", "I hope Satan has a nice colon, 'cause that's where you're gonna be living!"
3, 34, "Worm Mayor", "Stop! We'll leave.  But one day you'll be eating a fast-food burger and boom! You'll be crawling with us again. Ever wonder what makes special sauce so special? Yo!"
3, 34, "Leela", "Fry? I missed you. Did you find out what you needed to find out?"
3, 34, "Fry", "I'm about to.  Leela, let me play for you one for time."
3, 34, "Leela", "You don't have to do that. I'm still seduced from before."
3, 34, "Fry", "Please, it's important to me."
3, 34, "Leela", "What's that supposed to mean?"
3, 34, "Fry", "I don't know. I got nervous and I started thinking about neck bolts.  Wow! Did you see that vase break? It was all like--"
3, 34, "Leela", "What's happened to you?"
3, 34, "Fry", "Nothing. I got rid of the worms."
3, 34, "Leela", "What? Why would you do that?"
3, 34, "Fry", "Leela, I had worms. I needed to know who you loved. Me or them."
3, 34, "Leela", "Well ... which of you wrote me that sonnet?"
3, 34, "Fry", "I did ... I think. It was probably about 50/50. But that's how I really felt about you, I swear!"
3, 34, "Leela", "I don't know."
3, 34, "Fry", "Please. Give me a chance to be romantic on my own. I've got a baggy of massage oil, and I'm gonna give you my super back rub, just like a I used to give Amy when I was going out with her, and she always seemed-- Uh-oh!"
3, 34, "Bender", "Sorry you struck out, sausage link."
3, 34, "Bender", "If it's any consolation, my life is great! Babes! Bucks! I got it all!"
3, 34, "Fry", "Well, at least I learned Leela's a lost cause. I give up."
3, 34, "Bender", "There you go!  Goodnight. I gotta get up early to go parasailing with movie stars!"
3, 35, "Linda", "In what has become a winter tradition, members of the Zarlon 7 Polar Bear Club today took the plunge into a river of liquid ammonia."
3, 35, "Morbo", "There were no survivors."
3, 35, "Linda", "Takes all kinds! And now, with his annual Xmas message, here's the head of the Xmas Safety Council, the head of Walter Cronkite."
3, 35, "Walter Cronkite's head", "Season's warnings, Linda and Morbo."
3, 35, "Bender", "This guy's too trustworthy. What's his angle?"
3, 35, "Cronkite", "In all the tinsel and terror of the holiday season we too often underestimate that murderous brute better known as Santa Claus. With images of last year's gingerbread massacre freshly baked into our memories, I remind you to bolt your doors, say goodbye to your pets and lock your children in the closet. This is Walter Cronkite saying, ""I told you so""."
3, 35, "Hermes", "Sacred boa of West and Eastern Samoa. We've got to secure for Santa's arrival."
3, 35, "Fry", "Just as well. I'm getting tired of this wood show."
3, 35, "Farnsworth", "Cover that fireplace, confound you! I've only a few years to live. I don't wanna spend them dead."
3, 35, "Leela", "We're pushing as hard as we can."
3, 35, "Bender", "Oh, pushing!"
3, 35, "Farnsworth", "Oh, we're doomed! Every year we're doomed. Thanks be I had these bullet-proof shutters installed."
3, 35, "Farnsworth", "Bring it on, Santa! That bloodthirsty cadaver junkie can't touch us as long as we're not stupid enough to leave this building."
3, 35, "Fry", "Alright!"
3, 35, "Leela", "Yeah!"
3, 35, "Farnsworth", "In a related matter, you'll be delivering this sack of children's letters directly to Santa at his death fortress on Neptune."
3, 35, "Fry", "These letters are real butt-nutters!  Listen to this one"
3, 35, "Girl", "Please, please don't bring me any gifts. The bicycle you fired at me last year from your bicycle gun really tore up my insides."
3, 35, "Leela", "Awful! Let's read some more.  Dear Santa."
3, 35, "Boy", "Please bring me a coffin for Grandpa. You choked him with a chestnut last year and he's beginning to smell a lot like Xmas if you know what I mean."
3, 35, "Fry", "It's not fair. In my day Xmas was supposed to bring people together, not blow them apart!"
3, 35, "Bender", "Sure, but who's going to do anything about it? Certainly not us. No, sir!"
3, 35, "Fry", "Certainly yes us, uh-huh, sir! We've gotta bring back the kind of Xmas I remember."
3, 35, "Leela", "Fry's right. It's time to sit on Santa's lap -- and hard!"
3, 35, "Leela", "Oh, look! A cute little welcoming party."
3, 35, "Aide #1", "Hey! Wanna buy a tiny little kidney?"
3, 35, "Aide #2", "I'll let you punch me for a buck."
3, 35, "Fry", "Uh, look; we've got mail for Santa. Are you his elves?"
3, 35, "Aide #2", "We're not elves. We're Neptunians."
3, 35, "Aide #1", "We're just shrimp-y because he doesn't feed us."
3, 35, "Aide #2", "You hit me! You owe me a dollar."
3, 35, "Aide #3", "Hey, you got any food? Old teabags, chewed gum, apple cores? Come on! We're starving here!"
3, 35, "Fry", "But you live in a gingerbread house."
3, 35, "Aide #4", "Hey! It's food or shelter, not both."
3, 35, "Bender", "You lazy runts! Don't you get paid for making the toys?"
3, 35, "Aide #4", "Who said ""toys""?"
3, 35, "Neptunians", "Toys? Toys? Who said ""toys""?"
3, 35, "Aide #2", "False alarm, folks! There's no reason to make toys since Santa judges everyone to be naughty."
3, 35, "Fry", "That's it! I'm gonna deliver a gift of my boot up Santa's chimney. Where is he?"
3, 35, "Aide #2", "There! In his ice fortress."
3, 35, "Leela", "We'll need help getting in. Any volunteers?"
3, 35, "Aide #1", "I'll help you!"
3, 35, "Aide #2", "Ah, phooey!"
3, 35, "Aide #2", "An omen?"
3, 35, "Aide #1", "Dinner!"
3, 35, "Santa", "Let's see who's been naughty, and who's been naughty!  Mobsters beating up a shopkeeper for protection money. Very naughty!  Shopkeeper's not paying their protection money. Exactly as naughty!  I saw that!  Huh?"
3, 35, "Aide #2", "We brought your mail."
3, 35, "Santa", "Don't you ever knock? Who knows what naughty things I could be watching? I get New Orleans on this thing, you know!"
3, 35, "Aide #2", "Don't kill us!"
3, 35, "Leela", "Santa's a robot, so we should be able to destroy him with a logical paradox. Bender, you'd better cover your ears."
3, 35, "Santa", "Holy night! Intruders!"
3, 35, "Leela", "Hold it, Santa!  Consider this"
3, 35, "Santa", "Nice try. But my head was built with paradox-absorbing crumple-zones."
3, 35, "Leela", "Wait! This is what we're running from!"
3, 35, "Fry", "Faster! Faster!"
3, 35, "Fry", "Why aren't we moving?"
3, 35, "Leela", "I don't know. Usually when I do stuff like this the ship moves."
3, 35, "Santa", "Ho, ho-- Eh?"
3, 35, "Fry", "He's trapped!"
3, 35, "Aide #2", "Now we can make toys again!"
3, 35, "Neptunians", "Toys! Toys! Toys!"
3, 35, "Fry", "And I can deliver them. Billions and billions in one night."
3, 35, "Santa", "Ha! No human could do all that."
3, 35, "Fry", "Evil Knievel could!"
3, 35, "Santa", "Nuh-uh!"
3, 35, "Bender", "Santa's right. We need some sort of robot.  Aw, crap! I'm some sort of robot."
3, 35, "Neptunians", "Hooray!  Hooray!  Hooray!"
3, 35, "Santa", "Bender can't be Santa! He wasn't built to Yuletide specifications."
3, 35, "Bender", "Oh, yeah? Well I wasn't built to steal Leela's purse either.  But that didn't stop me."
3, 35, "Leela", "Bender!"
3, 35, "Bender", "Bow to your new Santa!"
3, 35, "Neptunians", "Our hero!"
3, 35, "Neptunians", "We are free and fairly sober,With so many toys to build."
3, 35, "Neptunians", "The machines are kinda tricky,Probably someone will be killed,But we gladly work for nothing--"
3, 35, "Fry", "Which is good because we don't intend to pay."
3, 35, "All", "The elves are back to work today!"
3, 35, "Neptunians", "Hooray!We have just a couple hours,To make several billion gifts,And the labour isn't easy--"
3, 35, "Leela", "Then you'll all work triple shifts,You can make the job go quicker if you turn up the controls to super-speed."
3, 35, "Fry", ",  and   It's back to work on Xmas Eve!"
3, 35, "Neptunians", "Hooray!"
3, 35, "Leela", "And though you're cold and sore and ugly,Your pride will mask the pain."
3, 35, "Fry", "Let my happy smile warm your hearts--"
3, 35, "Aide #5", "There's a toy lodged in my brain!"
3, 35, "Neptunians", "We are getting awfully tired,And we can't work any faster,And we're very, very sorry--"
3, 35, "Bender", "Why you selfish little bastards,Do you want the kids to think that Santa's just a crummy, empty-handed jerk?"
3, 35, "Aide #6", "Ow!"
3, 35, "Bender", "Then shut your yaps and back to work."
3, 35, "Neptunians", "Now it's very nearly Xmas,And we've done the best we could,"
3, 35, "Fry", "These toys soldiers are poorly painted."
3, 35, "Leela", "And they're made from inferior wood."
3, 35, "Bender", "I should give you all a beating,But I really have to fly."
3, 35, "Santa", "If I weren't stuck here frozen,I'd harpoon you in the eye."
3, 35, "Neptunians", "Now it's back into our tenements,To drown ourselves in rye."
3, 35, "Leela", "You did the best you could,I guess that some of these gorillas are OK."
3, 35, "Aide #7", "We're adequate!"
3, 35, "All", "The elves have rescued Xmas Day! Hooray!"
3, 35, "Bender", "Duh! Gee, Bender, how you gonna get through these bars?  I dunno, moron, suppose I bend them?  Duh, OK!"
3, 35, "Girl", "Mommy! Mommy! Santa's through the perimeter!"
3, 35, "Mrs. Grant", "This is it, kids. Take your suicide pills so you won't suffer."
3, 35, "Bender", "No, wait! I'm the good Santa. I've got toys ... at very reasonable prices!"
3, 35, "Jeffery", "Don't listen to him. He's the father of all lies and the uncle of all tricks!"
3, 35, "Bender", "But I come bearing Tri-ominos!"
3, 35, "Mrs. Grant", "Go for the shins!"
3, 35, "Bender", "One down..."
3, 35, "Petunia", "Well, hello there, handsome!  Won't you have a cookie?"
3, 35, "Bender", "Uh, don't mind if I do.  Ow! What's in these things?"
3, 35, "Petunia", "Why don't you slip into something more fiery?"
3, 35, "Bender", "Ow!"
3, 35, "Kwanzaabot", "Yo, Kringle! What happened to you, doll?"
3, 35, "Bender", "Oh, it's awful, Kwanzaabot. Everyone hates me."
3, 35, "Kwanzaabot", "At least they understand you, you know what I'm sayin'? Ain't nobody down with this Kwanzaa tip."
3, 35, "Bender", "Hey! Maybe you could lend me a hand with these deliveries."
3, 35, "Kwanzaabot", "No time! I gotta hand out the traditional Kwanzaa book.  I've been givin' these out for 647 years!"
3, 35, "Fry", "Ah! Bathtub eggnog! Just the way Grandma used to drink.  Ew! It went sour!"
3, 35, "Zoidberg", "Can't I have a scented bath in peace?"
3, 35, "Leela", "Remember, Professor, Bender is Santa. So we don't need to hurt him, right?"
3, 35, "Farnsworth", "Yes, yes, yes. You sound like a broken mp3!"
3, 35, "Bender", "Ho, ho--  Ow!"
3, 35, "Leela", "Professor! Don't you remember what I told you?"
3, 35, "Farnsworth", "No!"
3, 35, "Bender", "Oh, there's gotta be a better way."
3, 35, "Bender", "Bender, you're a genius!"
3, 35, "Vyolet", "This creates an unrealistic standard of beauty!"
3, 35, "Bender", "Now it's time for Santa to screw open his present!"
3, 35, "Smitty", "It's Santa! And we got him cornered!"
3, 35, "URL", "Aw, I smell a juicy promotion for me."
3, 35, "Smitty", "And a juicy re-hiring-back-onto-the-force for me!"
3, 35, "Bailiff", "This Xmas Day session of court will come to order. The Honourable Judge Whitey presiding."
3, 35, "Whitey", "Santa Claus, you stand accused of crimes against humanity. How do you plead?"
3, 35, "Bender", "Not Santa!"
3, 35, "Farnsworth", "There he is again!"
3, 35, "Hyper-Chicken", "Now, Pramala, I know it's scary in that there witness box but t'ain't no need to fear me.  I'm sorry, I thought you was corn. Now, would you please point at that robot over there.  No further questions.  Daddy done good, huh?"
3, 35, "Bender", "Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?"
3, 35, "Pramala", "Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy."
3, 35, "Bender", "And yet you haven't said what I told you to say. How can any of us trust you?"
3, 35, "Whitey", "Quit badgering the witness!"
3, 35, "Hyper-Chicken", "Badger? Where?"
3, 35, "Whitey", "Whereas I have a ham dinner with mayonnaise waiting for me at my mansion, I find the defendant guilty.  Santa Claus, I hereby sentence you to be executed at sundown."
3, 35, "Leela", "It's not fair. I just hope that dumb chicken is ashamed of himself."
3, 35, "Smitty", "Deactivated robot walking. We got a deactivated robot walking here."
3, 35, "Robot", "Hey, Santa, when you see the Robot Devil, tell him I'm-a comin'!"
3, 35, "Bender", "Hey, that guy said to tell you that--"
3, 35, "Robot Devil", "I heard him!"
3, 35, "Aide #1", "Greetings, masters. My companion and I made lots of toys."
3, 35, "Leela", "Outta my way, shrimp-oh. We're here to bring Santa back so we can prove Bender's innocent."
3, 35, "Santa", "Do what you will. But we'll see who has the last ho."
3, 35, "Leela", "There."
3, 35, "Fry", "Oh, no! The ice is melting!"
3, 35, "Leela", "The pollution from the factory! It caused a greenhouse effect."
3, 35, "Aide #1", "That would explain this heat."
3, 35, "Fry", "And your breezy short-shorts!"
3, 35, "Aide #2", "Uh, yeah! That would explain it."
3, 35, "Fry", "Hurry! We've gotta think of another way to save Bender or Xmas will be ruined!"
3, 35, "Leela", "Especially for Bender."
3, 35, "Santa", "Look out, Earth. I'm dreaming of a red Xmas."
3, 35, "Poopenmeyer", "Ah, good old Maggie!  Eh? When I pull this switch, these powerful electromagnets will tear you limb-from-limb, killing you in the most humane possible manner."
3, 35, "Bender", "But, Mr. Mayor, that doesn't sound humane."
3, 35, "Poopenmeyer", "It is for the witnesses because it's not boring!  The instant this random number generator reaches zero, you'll be executed."
3, 35, "Bender", "Aw!"
3, 35, "Poopenmeyer", "Ten. Three. Twelve. Three again."
3, 35, "Leela", "Stop the execution!"
3, 35, "Bender", "Leela!"
3, 35, "Poopenmeyer", "Fifteen. Negative eight."
3, 35, "Leela", "You got the wrong Santa. And I'll prove it."
3, 35, "Fry", "I'm Santa Claus!"
3, 35, "Poopenmeyer", "What? Twenty-seven."
3, 35, "Hermes", "No. I'm Santa Claus."
3, 35, "Poopenmeyer", "Six."
3, 35, "Amy", "We're also Santa Claus."
3, 35, "Zoidberg", "And I'm his friend Jesus!"
3, 35, "Fry", "Your Mayor-ness, if you execute him, you have to execute all of us."
3, 35, "Poopenmeyer", "You people aren't Santa. You're not even robots! Ninety-one. How dare you lie in front of Jesus!  Hey! Zero!"
3, 35, "Bender", "No! Not the magnets!   Swing low, sweet chariot, coming for to carry me home.  Swing low, sweet..."
3, 35, "Fry", "This is horrible."
3, 35, "Farnsworth", "But it's not boring!"
3, 35, "Santa", "Ho, ho, ho!"
3, 35, "Poopenmeyer", "My God! The real Santa! Get him, Jesus!"
3, 35, "Zoidberg", "I help those who help themselves."
3, 35, "Bender", "Santa! You saved my life. Please don't kill me!"
3, 35, "Santa", "I'm not here to kill you, Bender! I need you to help me save Xmas."
3, 35, "Bender", "Gee whiz, Santa! You want me to help you?"
3, 35, "Fry", "Don't do it! He's evil!"
3, 35, "Santa", "I know he is but I have no choice. I'm running late and if I don't complete my brutal rampage, well, it just wouldn't be Xmas. I guess what I'm asking is"
3, 35, "Bender", "Well ... 'tis the season!"
3, 35, "Man", "My hair!"
3, 35, "Woman", "My wedding cake!"
3, 35, "Santa", "Let it snow!"
3, 35, "Bender", "Merry Xmas, kids!"
3, 35, "Leela", "This wangs chun! After all the good we tried to do, Xmas turned out as rotten as ever."
3, 35, "Farnsworth", "No heat."
3, 35, "Amy", "No power."
3, 35, "Hermes", "Huddled together in fear like lice in a burning wig."
3, 35, "Fry", "Wait a second! Maybe your futuristic Xmas isn't so rotten after all."
3, 35, "Leela", "What are you talking about, you crouton? You said it yourself"
3, 35, "Fry", "But don't you see? Fear has brought us together. That's the magic of Xmas!"
3, 35, "Farnsworth", "That's a big crock of--  Hold me!"
3, 35, "Bender", "On, Trasher! On, Smasher!  Hey, Kwanzaabot, where you off to?"
3, 35, "Kwanzaabot", "Ah, you didn't hear about it? Chanukah Zombie's having a luau at the B'nai B'rith! You comin'?"
3, 35, "Bender", "Word!"
3, 35, "Santa", "By the way, Bender, here's a small token of my appreciation for being Santa while I was trapped in the ice."
3, 35, "Bender", "Hey, chief, you screwed up. There's nothing in here."
3, 35, "Santa", "Oh, it might appear empty but the message is clear"
3, 36, "Doctor", "Push, Mrs. Fry. You're almost there."
3, 36, "Mr. Fry", "You can do it, honey! Squeeze one out for America."
3, 36, "Mrs. Fry", "Hey, keep it down! It's the 9th inning."
3, 36, "Commentator", "Here's the 02 pitch to Craypool. He's taking all the way for a called strike three!"
3, 36, "Mrs. Fry", "Swing the bat, you bum!"
3, 36, "Doctor", "It's a boy. And look at that red hair!"
3, 36, "Mr. Fry", "You sayin' my son's a commie?"
3, 36, "Commentator", "And Grote leans into the pitch. It hits him! The Mets win!"
3, 36, "Mrs. Fry", "This is the happiest day of my life!"
3, 36, "Doctor", "Here's your baby, ma'am."
3, 36, "Mrs. Fry", "Yeah, OK, thanks."
3, 36, "Mr. Fry", "So, what should we name him?"
3, 36, "Mrs. Fry", "Uh, you pick. I picked dinner last night."
3, 36, "Mr. Fry", "Well, I was thinking of Philip. After those screwdrivers?"
3, 36, "Mrs. Fry", "That's a fantastic idea. More morphine, please."
3, 36, "Mr. Fry", "Look, Yancy, it's your baby brother, Philip."
3, 36, "Yancy", "I wanna be named Philip! Me Philip! Me Philip!"
3, 36, "Mr. Fry", "Son, your name is Yancy, just like me and my grandfather and so on. All the way back to minuteman Yancy Fry, who blasted commies in the American Revolution.  Philip, until I find a suitable model of an ICBM, you'll have to make do learnin' to fear this toy spacecraft."
3, 36, "Yancy", "Mine! Mine!"
3, 36, "Fry", "C'mon!"
3, 36, "Hermes", "Baby needs a new pair of shoes!"
3, 36, "Zoidberg", "To hell with your spoiled baby! I need those shoes!"
3, 36, "Announcer", "And it's a dead heat! They're checking the electron microscope. And the winner is ...  ... number 3, in a quantum finish."
3, 36, "Farnsworth", "No fair! You changed the outcome by measuring it."
3, 36, "Leela", "How'd you do, Fry?"
3, 36, "Fry", "I'll tell you when my horse finishes ... bad."
3, 36, "Mr. Wong", "In today's field we own four horses and two jockeys."
3, 36, "Mrs. Wong", "We just put our best jockey out to stud, Amy. He's perfect for you!"
3, 36, "Jockey", "Hey, baby! Ever do it in a suitcase?"
3, 36, "Bender", "Ooh! Look! It's the Centaur race."
3, 36, "Fry", "Come on! Come on! Hey, Leela, how about a kiss for good luck?  I meant tongue luck."
3, 36, "Announcer", "And the winner is number four -- Steven."
3, 36, "Fry", "I am so unlucky! I've run over black cats that were luckier than me."
3, 36, "Paper-hatted salesman", "Get your piping-hot horse burgers, horse fries, horse cake and shakes. We got tongue straight from the horse's mouth."
3, 36, "Leela", "Hmm."
3, 36, "Hermes", "It all sounds good."
3, 36, "Paper-hatted salesman", "All our horses are 100% horse-fed for that double-horse juiced-in goodness."
3, 36, "Leela", "I'll have the cholesterol-free omelette with horse beaters."
3, 36, "Paper-hatted salesman", "And you, sir, how can I horse you?"
3, 36, "Hermes", "I'll have a horse coke."
3, 36, "Paper-hatted salesman", "Horse Pepsi OK?"
3, 36, "Hermes", "Nay."
3, 36, "Jockey", "Hey! What are you doing?"
3, 36, "Bender", "This."
3, 36, "Fry", "Dear Horse God, I know I don't usually pray to you. Sometimes I doubt you even exist. But if you're willing to grant me luck, please, stamp your hoof once.  Come on, number six! Move it!  Don't do that! What are you--  Man, it's contagious!"
3, 36, "Announcer", "And the winner is Harry Trotter by the entire racetrack."
3, 36, "Bender", "That'll teach those other horses to take drugs!"
3, 36, "Fry", "That's it! You can only take my money for so long before you take it all, and I say enough.  I've got one dollar left, and this one I'm holding on to!  Oh, no you don't!  I may not know much about horses but I know a lot about doing anything for one dollar!  If you think bad luck can defeat me then you don't know my name is Philip J.--"
3, 36, "Paper-hatted salesman", "That is one unlucky guy!"
3, 36, "Fry", "Kareem's got the sky hook but Philip J. Fry's got the space hook!"
3, 36, "Yancy", "Yancy drives; he goes up with his patented space hook!"
3, 36, "Fry", "Hey! That's my patented space hook! You stole it!"
3, 36, "Yancy", "You're not the president of it!"
3, 36, "Fry", "Holy camolie! A seven-leaf clover!"
3, 36, "Yancy", "I'm dying of old age!"
3, 36, "Fry", "Game over! Phil wins! Yancy's fans are stunned! There'll be no celebration at the Yancy-dome!"
3, 36, "Yancy", "Lucky."
3, 36, "Leela", "Well, someone's in a good mode."
3, 36, "Bender", "Let's just say I lucked-out at the track! Also, I rigged one race."
3, 36, "Fry", "Pah! I'd have won a lot of money too if I still had my lucky seven-leaf clover. Plus I'd still have my hair."
3, 36, "Hairbot", "I got your page, Mr. Fry. Your new hair is ready."
3, 36, "Amy", "So whatever happened to this seven-leaf clover?"
3, 36, "Fry", "I hid it in a secret hiding place whose location I never told anyone. Not even Scruffy."
3, 36, "Zoidberg", "So the clover is still in the hiding place, maybe?"
3, 36, "Fry", "Hey, yeah! Maybe it is still there. Underground in the ruins of Old New York, helping some ant defeat another ant or helping some piece of dirt turn its luck around."
3, 36, "Farnsworth", "Dirt doesn't need luck."
3, 36, "Fry", "I'm going down there to get my clover back. Some of the tunnels have metal bars so I'll need someone who's good at bending. Leela, how 'bout you?"
3, 36, "Leela", "Sure. I'll do it."
3, 36, "Bender", "Like hell you will! Bending's my middle name."
3, 36, "Fry", "It is?"
3, 36, "Bender", "Yep. My full name is Bender Bending Rodríguez."
3, 36, "Fry", "Here's the entrance.  From this moment on, I declare my bad luck officially over."
3, 36, "Bender", "He was fun."
3, 36, "Leela", "Well, if we get bored looking for the clover, I've got Tetris on this thing."
3, 36, "Fry", "Look, up ahead."
3, 36, "Bender", "Old New York"
3, 36, "Fry", "Wow! We've got Manhattan all to ourselves! I can finally do all the crazy stuff I always dreamed of doing.   Howard Stern is overrated!  Uh, oops!"
3, 36, "Bender", "New York is so burned."
3, 36, "Fry", "And remember when Mayor Giuliani cracked down on jaywalking?"
3, 36, "Leela", "No."
3, 36, "Fry", "Well, Rudy, how do you like this action?"
3, 36, "Teen #1", "As you know, the big breakdance is Saturday. So if we wanna win those Jam Master J autographed parachute pants, our crew has to pop, lock and bust the freshest. Noticeably F.A.T., drop us a beat.  Name?"
3, 36, "Fry", "Cosmic F."
3, 36, "Teen #1", "Style?"
3, 36, "Fry", "Outer space."
3, 36, "Teen #1", "Special moves?"
3, 36, "Fry", "The moonwalk ... the robot ... the zero G."
3, 36, "Teen #1", "Name?"
3, 36, "Yancy", "Cosmic Y."
3, 36, "Teen #1", "Style?"
3, 36, "Yancy", "Uh, deep space!"
3, 36, "Fry", "Deep space?"
3, 36, "Teen #1", "Special moves?"
3, 36, "Yancy", "The spacewalk..."
3, 36, "Fry", "Hey!"
3, 36, "Yancy", "The robot..."
3, 36, "Fry", "The robot? That's similar to mine!"
3, 36, "Yancy", "The zero G."
3, 36, "Fry", "What are you doing? You totally ripped off my routine."
3, 36, "Yancy", "You callin' me a biter?"
3, 36, "Fry", "Why do you always have to steal everything from me, Yancy? Find your own life and live it."
3, 36, "Yancy", "Stop illin'! Word!"
3, 36, "Fry", "Well I'd like to see you try and steal this. The septuple-head-spin."
3, 36, "Yancy", "He's just scratching. No one's ever done more than a quadruple."
3, 36, "Fry", "Oh, yeah? Noticeably F.A.T., rewind the tape."
3, 36, "Teen #1", "Crazy sucker!"
3, 36, "Teen #2", "Phil, you're hot!"
3, 36, "Noticeably F.A.T.", "That was ice cold, bro!"
3, 36, "Teen #1", "Fry, if I ever see you try anything that crazy again, this crew might just have some new parachute pants!"
3, 36, "Yancy", "Stop hogging the clover."
3, 36, "Fry", "Alright, team, let's go find that clover!"
3, 36, "Leela", "Which way to your house? The sign says we're at 71st Street."
3, 36, "Fry", "71st Street? Hmm, never heard of it. Downtown could be in any direction."
3, 36, "Bender", "No sweat. We'll just take a spin on the B-train!"
3, 36, "Bender", "Ooh! That feels funny!  This is the Brooklyn-bound B-train making local stops at wherever the hell I feel like. Watch for the closing doors."
3, 36, "Bender", "Wake up, buddy. End of the line!"
3, 36, "Fry", "Gosh! My old neighbourhood.  That's the bench where I found some shirts! That fire hydrant! In summer we'd light it on fire! On that corner, some guy with a bushy beard handed out a socialist newsletter!"
3, 36, "Bender", "Was it poorly Xeroxed?"
3, 36, "Fry", "You'd better believe it!"
3, 36, "Leela", "The old comedians were right, this place is a lot different from L.A."
3, 36, "Mutant", "Pardon me, but did I overhear you saying you used to live here?"
3, 36, "Fry", "That's right."
3, 36, "Mutant", "Did you know Andy Goldman?"
3, 36, "Fry", "Yeah, he was my neighbour. Why?"
3, 36, "Mutant", "I mutated from him!"
3, 36, "Fry", "Get outta here! What's Andy up to these days?"
3, 36, "Andy", "The short answer is I'm teaching."
3, 36, "Leela", "He seemed nice."
3, 36, "Fry", "Sure. When he's sober!"
3, 36, "Fry", "Holy camolies! The house I grew up in. It's still there!"
3, 36, "Bender", "Man, Father Time really took a bat to this place."
3, 36, "Yancy", "That stupid clover is a worthless piece of garbage! Give it! Give it! Give it!"
3, 36, "Fry", "Mom! Help!"
3, 36, "Mrs. Fry", "Yes!"
3, 36, "Fry", "Mom, Yancy's trying to steal my clover."
3, 36, "Mrs. Fry", "Yancy, stealing is wrong."
3, 36, "Yancy", "Come back here, you! I'm gonna pile drive you!  You're dead meat!"
3, 36, "Mr. Fry", "What's happenin' up there? Did Kremlin Joe let fly with the nukes?"
3, 36, "Fry", "Not yet, commander. Yancy's just trying to steal my stuff as usual."
3, 36, "Mr. Fry", "Well he'd better keep his hands off these bananas. Gonna need them when the radiation turns us all into monkeys."
3, 36, "Fry", "The Ronco Record Vault! Yancy'll never get his hands on you in here or my money back.  Ah, The Breakfast Club soundtrack. Man, I can't wait till I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff.  Stay safe, clover. I may need you again someday."
3, 36, "Fry", "This was the storage room. My dad spent years turning it into a bomb shelter."
3, 36, "Leela", "And yet you guys never had a single nuclear war."
3, 36, "Bender", "What a waste."
3, 36, "Fry", "This is it. My Ronco Record Vault.  I still remember the combination"
3, 36, "Bender", "The Achilles heel of the Ronco design is its structural resonance frequency. Allow me.  There we go!"
3, 36, "Fry", "Here it is. The Breakfast Club soundtrack."
3, 36, "Bender", "You mean ""breakfast club sandwich""?"
3, 36, "Fry", "I hid my seven-leaf clover in this very record jacket so my brother Yancy wouldn't get it.  Here goes.  It's gone!  The whole place has been cleaned out! Yancy stole my clover! That thief!"
3, 36, "Leela", "How do you know it didn't disintegrate?"
3, 36, "Fry", "Everything else in here held up OK."
3, 36, "Bender", "Except Sports by Huey Lewis."
3, 36, "Fry", "I don't know why my brother hated me so much."
3, 36, "Leela", "Oh, brothers always fight. I'm sure deep down he loved you. He just never got a chance to say it before you got frozen."
3, 36, "Fry", "You think? 'Cause I always kinda wished that--"
3, 36, "Bender", "Who is that God-like figure?"
3, 36, "Fry", "It's my brother, Yancy! And there, in his lapel, my seven-leaf clover! I knew he stole it."
3, 36, "Leela", "Hold the phone. If that's Yancy, why does the inscription say Philip J. Fry?"
3, 36, "Fry", "Wait a second. That's my name! Good Lord. He ditched his goofy name and stole mine!"
3, 36, "Bender", "Apparently this brave Adonis, this Cadillac of men, was the first person on Mars."
3, 36, "Fry", "First person on Mars? I should have been the first person on Mars. He stole my clover, he stole my name and he stole my life.  And now he broke my hand!"
3, 36, "Bender", "His legend lives on."
3, 36, "Farnsworth", "So you opened the record vault and the clover was gone?"
3, 36, "Bender", "Yep. Nothing in there but all the best music of the 1980's in one amazing collection."
3, 36, "Leela", "Survivor, Pat Benatar, The Scorpions. The list goes on."
3, 36, "Fry", "That clover helped my ratfink brother steal my dream of going into space. Now I'll never get there."
3, 36, "Leela", "You went there this morning for doughnuts."
3, 36, "Hermes", "First person on Mars? Oh, so your brother was that Philip J. Fry."
3, 36, "Fry", "I'm Philip J. Fry! He stole my name after I got frozen."
3, 36, "Farnsworth", "Shut up, friends. My Internet browser heard us saying the word ""Fry"" and it found a movie about Philip J. Fry for us.  It also opened my calendar to Friday and ordered me some French fries."
3, 36, "Narrator", "Philip J. Fry"
3, 36, "Fry", "That should have been me!"
3, 36, "Narrator", "The ever-lucky Fry made his fortune after striking oil in the bathroom of the mansion he had won in a lottery."
3, 36, "Fry", "That's my clover! Yancy stole it!"
3, 36, "Narrator", "After a whirlwind fling with Icelandic supermodel Njörd, Fry scored a string of top 10 hits with his rock band Leaf Seven, known for their hypnotic rhythms, driving baselines and memorable hooks."
3, 36, "Fry", "That's what I'm known for!"
3, 36, "Man", "Phil came in, right, strummed out this tune, yeah, and I said, ""That's a number one record!"""
3, 36, "Narrator", "Today, Fry spends most of his time in his grave in Orbiting Meadows National Cemetery, buried with the trademark seven-leaf clover that will bring him luck in the next life, perhaps some Egyptians believe."
3, 36, "Fry", "So that's where my clover is? Hey, is that orbiting cemetery near here?"
3, 36, "Leela", "It will be in a couple hours."
3, 36, "Fry", "Good. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing."
3, 36, "Bender", "I'll get my kit."
3, 36, "Yancy", "Thanks for lending me your tux, Dad. It'll be perfect for my wedding."
3, 36, "Mr. Fry", "Yancy, that tux got me through 'Nam in style.  I just wish your brother were still around to see this."
3, 36, "Mrs. Fry", "I'll never forget the day Philip disappeared. Wisconsin won the Rose Bowl 17-9. Oh, I miss him."
3, 36, "Yancy", "Oh, that reminds me"
3, 36, "Mrs. Fry", "Have a look downstairs. Your brother may be missing but his crap sure isn't."
3, 36, "Yancy", "Hmm, Breakfast Club. This'll clear out the room at the end of the reception."
3, 36, "Leela", "They buried your brother in the World Heroes section? I'm impressed."
3, 36, "Fry", "I should be the one in that grave!"
3, 36, "Fry", "Hmm. We lost Bender."
3, 36, "Bender", "There! Now no one will be able to say I don't own John Larroquette's spine."
3, 36, "Fry", "Aha! My brother's grave!"
3, 36, "Leela", "Philip Fry, the original Martian."
3, 36, "Fry", "It's all lies, every word of it! He wasn't original, he wasn't a Martian, he wasn't Philip Fry and since when is he a the?"
3, 36, "Bender", "You're twice the the he ever was."
3, 36, "Fry", "It's clovering time!"
3, 36, "Yancy's wife", "So, had any ideas for names, Yancy?"
3, 36, "Yancy", "Uh, I'm sorta thinking one.  Daddy has a present for you today. Do you know what it is?  It's a lucky clover that can help you be successful whatever you do -- even breakdancing -- and it once belonged to someone very special."
3, 36, "Yancy's wife", "I know what name you wanna give him Yancy. It's OK."
3, 36, "Yancy", "Really?  Son, I'm naming you Philip J. Fry in honour of my little brother, who I miss every day. I love you, Philip, and I always will."
3, 36, "Fry", "Here lies Philip J. Fry, named for his uncle to carry on his spirit."
3, 36, "Bender", "Pay dirt! I got the clover! Plus his wedding ring.  Sorry, ladies, I'm taken! Hey, Fry, you want me to smack the corpse up a little?"
3, 36, "Leela", "Uh, Bender, I think Fry needs a moment alone."
3, 36, "Bender", "Alright, grab a shovel. I'm only one skull short of a Mouseketeer reunion."
3, 37, "Leela", "Fry, I know those cookies are fresh-a-licious but they produce an awful lot of trash."
3, 37, "Bender", "Ah!"
3, 37, "Leela", "And, Bender, that aerosol head spray makes your antenna smell nice--"
3, 37, "Bender", "Thank you."
3, 37, "Leela", "But it's doing long-term damage to the planet."
3, 37, "Bender", "So? It's not like it's the only one we've got."
3, 37, "Farnsworth", "Good news, everyone! I'm sending you on an extremely controversial mission."
3, 37, "Fry", "Controversial?"
3, 37, "Farnsworth", "Oh, my, no."
3, 37, "Farnsworth", "For this highly controversial mission you'll be towing the Juan Valdez, an orbiting supertanker full of rich Columbian dark matter."
3, 37, "Leela", "Dark matter oil? What if we hit something? The tanker could leak."
3, 37, "Farnsworth", "Impossible!  The tanker has 6,000 hulls. So, unlike me, it's entirely leak-proof.  Now, once you've hauled the tanker past the protestors--"
3, 37, "Leela", "Protestors?"
3, 37, "Farnsworth", "Correct. 6,000 hulls."
3, 37, "Leela", "Why do we have to fly within three feet of this penguin preserve on Pluto?"
3, 37, "Farnsworth", "To avoid the tollbooth."
3, 37, "Fry", "OK, she's all restocked with emergency jam. Let's get going."
3, 37, "Leela", "At the risk of sounding negative"
3, 37, "Farnsworth", "What are you yapping about?"
3, 37, "Leela", "This time it's your reckless disregard for the environment. In fact, I'm gonna go join those protestors."
3, 37, "Farnsworth", "This is an outrage! I demand you hand over your captain's jacket."
3, 37, "Leela", "This is my normal jacket. I've had it for 10 years."
3, 37, "Farnsworth", "I said hand it over!  Well, Fry, or should I say Captain Fry?  No, I shouldn't. Because Bender is the new captain!"
3, 37, "Fry", "Bender?"
3, 37, "Farnsworth", "That's right. Being captain is about intuition and heart. A good captain can't have either one. That's why cold, logical Bender is perfect for the job."
3, 37, "Bender", "Well, I do think of human life as expendable."
3, 37, "Fry", "No fair! Leela was training me to be captain. She even let me sit in her lap and steer -- in this comic I drew."
3, 37, "Zoidberg", "Ooh! The new one's out!"
3, 37, "Bender", "Fry, the title of captain may inflate the human ego, but it's beneath the notice of my mighty robo-logic.  Now look spry, men! We launch at six bells!"
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "Greetings, Econauts. I'm Free Waterfall Sr., founder of Penguins Unlimited.  Whoa! No, no! No applause. Every time you clap your hands you kill thousands of spores that'll some day form a nutritious fungus. Just show your approval with a mould-friendly thumbs up.  Please hold your thumbs until the end. Now, folks, it's time to stop that tanker with a non-violent human circle."
3, 37, "Leela", "Why do we have to resort to non-violence? Can't we just kick their asses?"
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "Now, little lady, those people's asses are living things too."
3, 37, "Bender", "Aye! We're hitched up tighter than Davy Jones' U-Haul! At ease, men."
3, 37, "Fry", "I am at ease."
3, 37, "Bender", "Mr. Fry, I like to give my first mate an informal nickname. From now on you will be known as ... Wiggles!"
3, 37, "Fry", "The hell I will! Have you even read the Captain's Handbook?"
3, 37, "Bender", "I have now. And what's Peter Parrot's first rule of captaining?"
3, 37, "Fry", "Always respect the chain o' command ... captain."
3, 37, "Bender", "Correct, Wiggles. You've just earned an invitation to the captain's table"
3, 37, "Zoidberg", "The captain's table! What an honour!"
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "Our peace ring has 'em trapped like a tiger in a washing machine!"
3, 37, "Leela", "Get ready!"
3, 37, "Protestor #1", "Look out!"
3, 37, "Protestor #2", "Hold on!"
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "Here they come!"
3, 37, "Leela", "When you were planning this peace ring, didn't you realise spaceships can move in three dimensions?"
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "No, I did not."
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "Folks, that tanker gave us the slip, but we'll stop 'em here on Pluto. If you're cold, rub your bodies with permafrost. It's nature's long johns.  If rubbing frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey, I don't wanna be right!"
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "This here is our penguin preserve."
3, 37, "Leela", "Aw! They're so cute! They're like if puppies and kittens could have babies!"
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "We use hand puppets around the young'uns to simulate a natural environment."
3, 37, "Leela", "That's adorable!"
3, 37, "Bender", "But I suppose it's this medal I'm most proud of, Wiggles. I won it for saving the children of Earth from a giant kangaroo. It was on the Australian news, you probably didn't see it."
3, 37, "Zoidberg", "Brilliant!"
3, 37, "Fry", "Would you cram a sock in it, Bender? Those aren't even medals, they're bottle-caps and pepperoni slices!"
3, 37, "Bender", "Thank you, steward. Wiggles, weren't you about to propose a toast to your gallant captain?"
3, 37, "Fry", "Fine, I've got a toast. To Captain Bender, he's the best ...  ... at being a big jerk who's stupid and his big, ugly face is as dumb as a butt."
3, 37, "Bender", "Eh, I've heard better."
3, 37, "Fry", "If I were in charge I wouldn't treat you like this. You're nothing but a big blowhard."
3, 37, "Bender", "Sir, you forget yourself! Shut up!"
3, 37, "Fry", "Being captain is obviously more important to you than being my friend. I'm going."
3, 37, "Bender", "Going? But a captain can't drink without his first mate."
3, 37, "Zoidberg", "You can drink with me maybe?"
3, 37, "Bender", "I don't feel like drinking."
3, 37, "Zoidberg", "Then, if you'll excuse me, I see some ravioli that only has two shoe prints on it.  Three."
3, 37, "Bender", "Oh, Greenland is a barren land,A land that bears no green,Where there's ice and snow,And the whale fishes blow,And the--"
3, 37, "Zoidberg", "Captain, please, have some liquor. You robots need alcohol to function."
3, 37, "Bender", "Gah! I once knew a guy ... you look like him. But he wasn't either.  I'm a good captain."
3, 37, "Zoidberg", "Please, sir, I love you like a father!"
3, 37, "Protestor #3", "Here they come. Oh, I hope they read my sign!"
3, 37, "Leela", "Bender's flying too low! And he's upside-down!"
3, 37, "Protestor #3", "He must be talking on a cell phone!"
3, 37, "Fry", "What's happening?"
3, 37, "Zoidberg", "All 6,000 hulls have been breached!"
3, 37, "Fry", "Oh, the fools! If only they'd built it with 6,001 hulls! When will they learn?"
3, 37, "Linda", "Continuing our coverage of a tragic  but far away  story. The crisis on Pluto worsens as dark matter spreads throughout the penguin habitat. The images are truly horrific."
3, 37, "Leela", "I don't think any of us can understand how those poor, oil-drenched penguins feel."
3, 37, "Morbo", "Oily humanoid!  At the time of the crash, the tanker captain had an alcohol level of .08 percent -- well below the legal limit for robots."
3, 37, "Hyper-Chicken", "Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal"
3, 37, "Bender", "Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just got me the death penalty?"
3, 37, "Hyper-Chicken", "I'd have done better but it's plum hard pleadin' a case while awaitin' trial for that there incompetence!"
3, 37, "Bender", "Yeah, uh, good luck with that."
3, 37, "Leela", "Now you stay away from those puffin twins."
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "Good way to avoid frostbite, folks"
3, 37, "Leela", "Uh ... I think I'll go check on Bender."
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "Watch that he doesn't pick your pocket."
3, 37, "Bender", "Ah, can't beat fresh-squeezed!"
3, 37, "Leela", "Bender, can you at least pretend you're being punished?  And clean the black parts too."
3, 37, "Smitty", "Are they black with white feathers or white with black feathers?"
3, 37, "URL", "It don't matter, baby, they're all beautiful!"
3, 37, "Bender", "Yo, screws, more Tegrin over here?  Oh, ho! What's this?"
3, 37, "URL", "Aw, man! He got away!"
3, 37, "Smitty", "I guess this is why Chief says no hugging."
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "Good work, everyone. I suggest you all go get some sleep. Me, well, I'm gonna stay up all night singing songs about penguins in a fine, piercing tenor."
3, 37, "Leela", "Has anyone seen Bender?  Bender?  Here robot, robot, robot."
3, 37, "Leela", "Hey, why weren't you Kong donkeys outside cleaning up?"
3, 37, "Zoidberg", "They sent us inside for doing an unsatisfactory job.   And eating penguin eggs."
3, 37, "Fry", "You ate most of them. So, where's Captain Bender? Off catastrophising some other planet?"
3, 37, "Zoidberg", "Damnit, Fry! He may have done wrong, but he's still your captain."
3, 37, "Leela", "I'm worried about him. He didn't come back with the group."
3, 37, "Fry", "He didn't?"
3, 37, "Leela", "No, and with wind-chill it's 20 degrees below absolute zero. I'd better go find him."
3, 37, "Fry", "Wait. Let me. Bender and I have our disagreements, but we're still friends and I'm gonna show him what that means.  To the ship."
3, 37, "Leela", "Why don't you just walk? He was only about 20 yards from here."
3, 37, "Fry", "Madam, I am in command now."
3, 37, "Zoidberg", "Such a man! I'd follow him to hell and back, I would."
3, 37, "Bender", "What the--?  What's this water made of, ice? Forget this!"
3, 37, "Penguin #1", "Full of fish?"
3, 37, "Bender", "Not entirely."
3, 37, "Penguin #1", "Then let's fish."
3, 37, "Zoidberg", "Captain, I don't think we're on Pluto any longer. In fact, we may have left space as we know it."
3, 37, "Fry", "Then where are we? You said you knew how to navigate."
3, 37, "Zoidberg", "Stop yelling at me!"
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "Folks, it's worse than we thought. Seems dark matter is nature's sex drug. It's like a perverted trail mix of penguin oestrogen, penguin Viagra and Spanish penguin fly. Why, it's making them ultra-fertile."
3, 37, "Leela", "How ultra?"
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "Well your garden variety penguin lays one egg a year. Since the spill our penguins have been laying six eggs every 15 minutes.  Also, the eggs hatch in only 12 hours.  Also, the males are laying eggs."
3, 37, "Doctor", "This man is over-gasped."
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "If the birds keep multiplying there'll soon be too many to count.  Before long the penguins will exhaust their food supply and starve to death."
3, 37, "Leela", "Oh, if only we hadn't flown penguins to Pluto and dumped oil on them, this might never have happened. Can't we stop them from multiplying?"
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "Yes, I reckon it is our responsibility. And thankfully we have a plan."
3, 37, "Leela", "What is it? We'll do anything."
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "Everyone, grab your guns. I declare penguin hunting season officially open."
3, 37, "Leela", "You can't shoot penguins. Isn't there some way to keep them from breeding?"
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "Cold showers don't work on Antarctic creatures. Now surely you agree that a quick, semi-painless death is a damn sight better than weeks of starvation."
3, 37, "Leela", "Well, I suppose... But-- I mean-- I joined Penguins Unlimited to love penguins, not to hunt them."
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "This time the two are one and the same! Now are you with us or are you gonna let innocent penguins suffer?"
3, 37, "Leela", "Oh, God! It's inhuman! It's like Hong Kong! I'll do it!"
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "That's a good old-fashioned gun. Simple point-and-click interface. Rifle check!"
3, 37, "Hunter #1", "Oh, yeah!"
3, 37, "Hunter #2", "Wee doggy!"
3, 37, "Leela", "Hey, you're enjoying this."
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "Look, nobody enjoys shooting penguins. But if you have to shoot penguins, well, you might as well enjoy it."
3, 37, "Leela", "I'm sorry, but if it's fun in any way it's not environmentalism."
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "Oh, really? How 'bout blowing up dams?"
3, 37, "Leela", "Yeah ... that is fun."
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "Let's conservate!"
3, 37, "Zoidberg", "It's been an honour to serve under you, sir!"
3, 37, "Leela", "Alright, this is for their own good. Don't leave orphans. Gotta kill entire families.  But they're so cute. No! You can do this. It's just like murdering a little butler. I-I can't look.   Oh, no! What have I done?  Oh, you poor little guy! I'm so sorry I-- Bender?  Bend. 2] Cheese It! He stands up and takes the bullet out of his head. Leela stops crying.] What's going on? Were you hiding out with these little guys?"
3, 37, "Bender", "Of course not. Filthy ice rats! Scat! Shoo!  Gah! What are you doing? Get away!"
3, 37, "Leela", "Aw! They love you!"
3, 37, "Bender", "Well I don't love them.  Aw!  I don't know why but when I look down at their little faces, it makes me wanna puke! In a good way!"
3, 37, "Penguins", "Stand still. It's our only hope."
3, 37, "Bender", "That's puffin talk. Now follow me!"
3, 37, "Leela", "Stop! Stop shooting! It's me, Leela."
3, 37, "Hunter #2", "Sorry."
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "Why aren't you firing randomly into those birds, little lady? Don't you wanna help 'em?"
3, 37, "Leela", "Not this way."
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "What? Why you're not a tree-hugging kook at all!"
3, 37, "Leela", "Look, I don't know if shooting penguins will help the environment or not. But I do know the decision shouldn't be in the hands of people who just wanna kill for fun."
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "Leela, you may just be farming some free-range truth there.  On the other hand, we already made up 200 pounds of batter for penguin tempura. OK, boys, it's them or us!"
3, 37, "Leela", "No!"
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "Hey! Where'd they--"
3, 37, "Bender", "Attack!"
3, 37, "Hunter #1", "Whoa!"
3, 37, "Hunter #2", "Ow!"
3, 37, "Bender", "We will fight them on the beaches! We will fight them on the glaciers!"
3, 37, "Waterfall Sr.", "Make sure they use every part of my body!"
3, 37, "Old Man Waterfall", "I'll avenge your death, son!"
3, 37, "Leela", "They used to be such peaceful birds. I suppose this was your doing."
3, 37, "Bender", "Yep. It's like I taught 'em"
3, 37, "Leela", "Oh, if only we had a toboggan."
3, 37, "Bender", "Faster! Faster!"
3, 37, "Leela", "Phew!"
3, 37, "Bender", "Oh, phew!  Oh, right, they can swim. It's all coming back to me now."
3, 37, "Leela", "It's Fry!"
3, 37, "Bender", "Wiggles?"
3, 37, "Leela", "Well, at least it'll help reduce their population."
3, 37, "Bender", "Yeah, life is hilariously cruel.  Permission to come aboard, Wiggles?"
3, 37, "Fry", "Granted. We can't take off without our captain."
3, 37, "Bender", "Oh, and bring my toboggan."
3, 37, "Fry", "So, Leela, were you able to help the penguins?"
3, 37, "Leela", "Well, sure. I mean ... not really. I mean ... nature will work itself out. It can't screw things up any worse than we did trying to fix things, right?"
3, 37, "Fry", "I 'unno."
3, 37, "Bender", "Ah, quit your worrying. Thanks to my shining influence those stupid birds'll do just fine."
3, 38, "Leela", "Guidance system?"
3, 38, "Bender", "Online."
3, 38, "Leela", "Autopilot?"
3, 38, "Autopilot", "Present."
3, 38, "Leela", "Dark matter indicator?"
3, 38, "Fry", "Making the noise."
3, 38, "Leela", "All systems operational. Let's rock!"
3, 38, "Leela", "Gentlemen, I've completed my report on the crash."
3, 38, "Bender", "Whoa! I'm not reading that crap. Summarise it in one word."
3, 38, "Leela", "Sabotage.  This is a normal L-unit. Without it, space travel is but the fevered dream of a madman."
3, 38, "Fry", "Yep."
3, 38, "Bender", "Of course."
3, 38, "Zoidberg", "Doy!"
3, 38, "Hermes", "It's an important unit."
3, 38, "Leela", "And this, my friends, is the L-unit I just removed from the ship."
3, 38, "Fry", "That doesn't look like an ""L"" at all. Unless you count lowercase."
3, 38, "Bender", "You know we don't!"
3, 38, "Leela", "Whoever did this was strong. This is 340 pounds of Tonka-tough steel."
3, 38, "Bender", "Hmm. It should look like this.  But instead it looks like this."
3, 38, "Fry", "Who would do a thing like that?"
3, 38, "Bender", "Who could do a thing like that? And by ""that"", I mean this."
3, 38, "Zoidberg", "Well, gang, it looks like we have another mystery on our hands."
3, 38, "Hermes", "I'd better make a chart of the suspects. I'll begin by drawing a line with my straight-edge.  Sweet lamprey of Santa Fe! My edge has been bent!"
3, 38, "Amy", "My javelin too! It's ruined.  Now we'll never beat Jupiter State."
3, 38, "Zoidberg", "My slinky!  My cuddly, little pet slinky!"
3, 38, "Farnsworth", "What's all the hubbub?"
3, 38, "Leela", "My God! Even the Professor's been bent."
3, 38, "Farnsworth", "That you for your sympathy, talking square of linoleum."
3, 38, "Bender", "I'll get you fixed up.  That's fine."
3, 38, "Amy", "Wait a minute. Bender, what did you just do to the Professor?"
3, 38, "Bender", "I bent him."
3, 38, "Amy", "Aha!"
3, 38, "Hermes", "Bender!"
3, 38, "Zoidberg", "J'accuse!"
3, 38, "Bender", "Oh, I see. A bunch of stuff gets bent so it must be the robot designed for bending."
3, 38, "Hermes", "I know how to settle this"
3, 38, "Fry", "Huh?"
3, 38, "Amy", "What tapes?"
3, 38, "Leela", "Surveillance?"
3, 38, "Zoidberg", "You've seen me naked?"
3, 38, "Hermes", "Ah. Last night's tape. It was right next to Bathroom Bloopers 4."
3, 38, "Bender", "See? Nothing. Told you, losers."
3, 38, "Fry", "Wait! There on the screen. It's that guy you are."
3, 38, "Bender", "I'm sleepwalking."
3, 38, "Farnsworth", "Dear God! We've got robots on the ceiling."
3, 38, "Fry", "You weren't sleepwalking, you were sleep-bending!"
3, 38, "Bender", "This is quite a shock. On the other hand, it's not surprising in the least. After all, I've been bending since the day I was built."
3, 38, "Bender", "I was born on an assembly line in the bad part of Tijuana."
3, 38, "Bender", "Mama.  Hooray! I graduated! Time to bend around Europe for a few months, then get a job bending."
3, 38, "Amy", "You remember your own birth?"
3, 38, "Bender", "Sure. It was only four years ago."
3, 38, "Fry", "You're only four years old?"
3, 38, "Bender", "Precocious little scamp, ain't I?"
3, 38, "Leela", "Hmm. Bender must have a pent-up need to bend that's not being satisfied by his bend-free lifestyle."
3, 38, "Farnsworth", "Then he can't stay here. He's a menace to every straight person in the company.  Go satisfy your bend lust and don't you come back to work until you do."
3, 38, "Robots", "No more bending, no more work. Give us a raise, you big fat jerk."
3, 38, "Sal", "Nevers!"
3, 38, "Joey", "Yo! The Mafia supports you. But don't tell no one. Spread the word."
3, 38, "Donbot", "As the duly-elected mobsters of this union, it's our duty to support the struggle of these proud, lazy slobs."
3, 38, "Joey", "Yeah, but what if management remains intragnizent?"
3, 38, "Donbot", "From the context it is clear what you mean. In that case, Clamps may have a little surprise for them."
3, 38, "Clamps", "The clamps!   Right?"
3, 38, "Bender", "Aw, no! A strike? Now I'll never get to bend anything. Oh, woe is Bender."
3, 38, "Robot #1", "Hang tough, brother. Management refused our demand to switch casual Friday to Monday."
3, 38, "Bender", "What?"
3, 38, "Robot #2", "And now they're hiring scabs at ten-times the normal wage."
3, 38, "Bender", "Ten-times normal wage?  I'll give those jerks what for!"
3, 38, "Sal", "Welcomes aboard, scab."
3, 38, "Bender", "Great to be here."
3, 38, "Sal", "Come on. I'll introduces you to your scab co-workers you'll be scabbing with.  This here's our scab foreman."
3, 38, "Bender", "Flexo?"
3, 38, "Flexo", "Bender?"
3, 38, "Bender", "Hey, sorry you got sent to that South American Turkish prison instead of me on account of mistaken identity."
3, 38, "Flexo", "You bastard! They treated me like an animal and that's what I became!  Nah, you're alright. Good to see you, buddy!"
3, 38, "Sal", "And here's another scab what also works here, Angle-ine."
3, 38, "Bender", "Hello."
3, 38, "Sal", "Hey, yous guyses wanna move that things?"
3, 38, "Bender", "Hello!"
3, 38, "Robots", "Give us a raise, you big fat jerk."
3, 38, "Sal", "Nevers!"
3, 38, "Bender", "Ow!  Um, hi, Angle-ine. Whatcha up to?"
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "Making hangers. Guidance counsellor said I had a knack for it."
3, 38, "Bender", "That's cool, that's cool. So, um, uh, I was wondering if, y'know, it's cool if not, but, what are you doing after work?"
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "What I always do. Jack squat."
3, 38, "Bender", "Me too.  Man, we have a lot in common, huh?"
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "Well we are made of virtually identical components."
3, 38, "Bender", "Are you sure? Maybe I should sneak a peek at your access panel."
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "Hey, according to the scab handbook that's extremely inappropriate banter.  And that's just the way I like it."
3, 38, "Hermes", "Haile H. Selassie!"
3, 38, "Zoidberg", "There, little friend. Good as new."
3, 38, "Farnsworth", "What an exquisite day. That azure sky, the verdant treetops.  Those delightful birds with their chirp, chirp, chirp and their tweet, tweet, splat."
3, 38, "Fry", "Professor, I've never seen you so cheerful. What the hell's wrong with you?"
3, 38, "Farnsworth", "Hmm. I'm not quite sure. Perhaps seeing things from a new perspective has reminded me of life's beauty. Or perhaps my new posture is causing blood to pool in the back of my brain, resulting in a mild delirium. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose."
3, 38, "Fry", "I wish! It's a nickel."
3, 38, "Bender", "Union forever! Lousy scabs! They can't do those things! Et cetera!"
3, 38, "Bender", "I bet watching me bend girders like this turns your legs all rubbery."
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "Well my legs are made of rubber.  And anyway, I am just as strong as you are, Mac."
3, 38, "Bender", "Oh, yeah?  Prove it.  Here, let me help you."
3, 38, "Farnsworth", "My new bent outlook has completely re-energised me. I'm even dating a young Brazilian retired actress."
3, 38, "Fry", "Alright!"
3, 38, "Farnsworth", "Some say I'm robbing the cradle but I say she's robbing the grave."
3, 38, "Bender", "Howdy, doodies. What's new?"
3, 38, "Farnsworth", "I was just regaling your former co-workers with a tale of bedroom antics, the likes of which--"
3, 38, "Bender", "Yeah, yeah! Big whoop! No one cares. I got Bender-related news. I'm in love and I'm taking all my friends out to celebrate."
3, 38, "Amy", "Let's get liquored up!"
3, 38, "Elzar", "Hey, look at this crowd. You guys gotta try the pasta. It's got a real nice profit margin. Bam! So, special occasion tonight?"
3, 38, "Bender", "Oh, Elzar, you'll never guess what's happened?"
3, 38, "Elzar", "Bam?"
3, 38, "Bender", "I met the most dynamite ladybot."
3, 38, "Elzar", "Hey, that's terrific. To celebrate, I'm gonna stick seven copies of my latest cookbook on your bill."
3, 38, "Bender", "Bless you, sir."
3, 38, "Farnsworth", "So, Bender, tell us about this new girlfriend of yours."
3, 38, "Bender", "I intend to. Through the lost art of the toast.  To Angle-ine, she's got it all. Looks, charm and the love of a fabulous bending robot."
3, 38, "Fry", "She sure does."
3, 38, "Bender", "Flexo!"
3, 38, "Elzar", "Careful, that's a week old!"
3, 38, "Bender", "I finally meet a nice girl with a pair of legs that don't quit unexpectedly and that jerk Flexo steals her away? It's time to kick some shiny, metal ass.  You degenerate hussy! I'm disappointed in you too, Angle-ine."
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "Bender, it's-it's not what you think."
3, 38, "Bender", "Oh, God! Then it's worse than I think."
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "Now, look, there is no reason to be upset. Flexo and I are divorced."
3, 38, "Bender", "Div-- Huh?"
3, 38, "Flexo", "We're just havin' dinner 'cause we wanna stay friends."
3, 38, "Bender", "Uh, I knew that. What I'm actually outraged by is your choice of wine. Really, it's the steward's fault."
3, 38, "Steward", "Excellent choice, sir."
3, 38, "Bender", "That Flexo, I'm knockin' him right on his butt. I can't believe this."
3, 38, "Farnsworth", "Obsessing won't help, Bender. Take a lean back and enjoy life."
3, 38, "Bender", "I can't. My Fembot may be in love with another Manbot."
3, 38, "Leela", "Well talk to her. Tell her about your feelings in an open an honest way."
3, 38, "Fry", "Yeah. Either that or be a man."
3, 38, "Bender", "OK, I've constructed an elaborate lie"
3, 38, "Fry", "That's thinkin' like a man."
3, 38, "Bender", "Hello? This is Flexo."
3, 38, "Bender", "Now we'll see who loves whom."
3, 38, "Bender", "Hey, hot stuff."
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "Hey, Flexo.  So since when do you go to bars on work nights? It's not like you at all."
3, 38, "Bender", "Nonsense. It's exactly like me. Flexo"
3, 38, "Bartender-bot", "Two Fuzzy Navel's comin' up."
3, 38, "Bender", "I hope they can make change for a fortune."
3, 38, "Joey", "Yo. Get an eye-load of that filthy scab with the beard flashing his filthy scab money. It's an insult to you, boss."
3, 38, "Donbot", "Yeah. That cash oughta be slushin' my fund and kicksing my back."
3, 38, "Clamps", "I'm greasing up my whoozits!"
3, 38, "Donbot", "Whoa, whoa, Clamps, not yet. Let's just keep an eye on him and see if he does it a couple more times."
3, 38, "Bender", "You're lookin' good to Flexo tonight."
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "Quit makin' with the googly eyes. You know that I'm in love with Bender."
3, 38, "Bender", "Bender? That walking wuss factory?"
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "Well he may be a walking factory but believe me he is no wuss. Now, look, you and me are through. I told you that when I divorced you."
3, 38, "Bender", "But going through a divorce together, you can't tell me that didn't bring us closer. Care to dance?"
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "You know I love dancing but you always hated it."
3, 38, "Bender", "In that case it's something I've always wanted to make up to you.  Hey, scratchmo. How 'bout dropping me and the lady some rump-rattling beats?"
3, 38, "Donbot", "I had hoped that by the second time he flashed his cash my rage would have subsided. Sadly that has not happened."
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "You used to be so inflexible, Flexo. You have really loosened up!"
3, 38, "Bender", "I recently upgraded my funk card. C'mon!"
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "Alright!"
3, 38, "Bender", "C'mon now, what's new!  Ew!"
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "Flexo? What-What's going on?"
3, 38, "Bender", "Um..."
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "Flexo!"
3, 38, "Bender", "So the moral of the story is"
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "You always were a kick in the teeth, man."
3, 38, "Bender", "Aw, shucks, thunder-buns! You make me feel like a million volts."
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "Flexo, Flexo, Flexo. I'm starting to remember why I fell for you in the first place."
3, 38, "Bender", "So, she's falling for Flexo, eh? I'd better seduce her a little more, just to be sure."
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "Well, it's late. I should get home to my trailer."
3, 38, "Bender", "I'll walk you out. After all, a true gentleman tends to his date's every need.  Tiparillo?"
3, 38, "Bender", "Here you are, my lad. Bring the lady's car around in the finest way possible."
3, 38, "Joey", "He's flashin' his cash loaf again."
3, 38, "Donbot", "How many times is that? Two or three?"
3, 38, "Clamps", "Three."
3, 38, "Donbot", "Alright. That's the necessary number of times. That scab's gonna have a little on-the-job accident."
3, 38, "Joey", "With all due respect, Donbot, I don't think we should rely on an accident happening. Let's kill him ourselves."
3, 38, "'Angle-ine", "Well, goodnight. I-I had a great time."
3, 38, "Bender", "How 'bout a lift? To your place."
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "What?"
3, 38, "Bender", "Admit it. You felt something for me tonight. And by ""me"" I mean Flexo."
3, 38, "'Angle-ine", "Hey, look, I had fun, but--"
3, 38, "Bender", "But?"
3, 38, "'Angle-ine", "But--"
3, 38, "Bender", "But?"
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "But...  Huh? Bender! You tricked me."
3, 38, "Bender", "That's right, baby. I ain't your lover boy, Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anybody pretending to be him."
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "Well maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you're pretending to be."
3, 38, "Bender", "Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now"
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "Nooo!"
3, 38, "Flexo", "Thanks, I appreciate that.  Nah, I'm joshing you. That was quite annoying."
3, 38, "Bender", "You call yourself divorced? You're making a mockery of one of our oldest institutions."
3, 38, "Flexo", "What?"
3, 38, "Clamps", "Alright, boss, give the word and I'll drop this unbendable girder. Clamp, clamp, ka-bamp!"
3, 38, "Donbot", "Remember, only kill the one with the beard. That other filthy scab we got nothing against."
3, 38, "Flexo", "That's low!"
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "Please stop! I'm not worth it!"
3, 38, "Bender", "Probably not. But I love you and I'm gonna kick his ass till I win you back."
3, 38, "Donbot", "OK, Clamps. Now!"
3, 38, "Clamps", "Ooh, that's gotta clamp!"
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "Flexo? Are you OK?"
3, 38, "Flexo", "Yeah, never better.  Nah, I'm yankin' your chain, I'm dying."
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "You can't die. Tonight Bender showed me that I love you."
3, 38, "Bender", "But, I love you."
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "I know and I care for you too. But I could never love anyone as much as you made me realise I love Flexo."
3, 38, "Bender", "But ... but...  I love you so much, Angle-ine, I want you to be happy no matter what."
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "What, what are you saying?"
3, 38, "Bender", "I'm saying I've got an unbendable girder to bend."
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "You can't bend that girder. It's unbendable!"
3, 38, "Bender", "Well I don't know anything about lifting, so that just leaves us the one option."
3, 38, "Flexo", "Thanks, buddy. Another year under that and I'd have been a goner."
3, 38, "Angle-ine", "I'll always remember this, Bender."
3, 38, "Bender", "Me too. Me too.  Jerk."
3, 38, "Leela", "So Flexo and Angle-ine had sex right there on the factory floor? Well, at least you got bending out of your system."
3, 38, "Bender", "Yes. I won't be up to bending again for a long, long time."
3, 38, "Farnsworth", "Perhaps it's your outlook that needs a good bend. A 90-degree bend to a place where happiness is perpendicular to wonderment."
3, 38, "Fry", "Professor, we're all sick of your upbeat attitude."
3, 38, "Amy", "I'll say."
3, 38, "Zoidberg", "Believe it."
3, 38, "Farnsworth", "Nonsense. It's just like in the song I wrote"
3, 38, "Leela", "Bender, you've gotta help us."
3, 38, "Bender", "I try to get out but they keep pulling me back in."
3, 38, "Farnsworth", "You gotta dangle,Have a new angle,Wangle a new dangle on life,"
3, 38, "Amy", "No, Bender! The other way."
3, 38, "Bender", "I like him better this way."
3, 38, "Farnsworth", "I'm sad now."
3, 38, "Leela", "Eh, it's fine."
3, 39, "Amy", "Is Nibbler stoked for the big pet show?"
3, 39, "Leela", "He ought to be with all the strict training I've been putting him through.  Nibbler, roll over and you get a ham.  Roll over. Roll over for the ham.  You are so adorable! Who wants a ham?"
3, 39, "Farnsworth", "Zooka barooka! First prize is $500 and a year's supply of dog food!"
3, 39, "Bender", """$500"", you say?"
3, 39, "Zoidberg", """Dog food"", you say?"
3, 39, "Fry", "Man, that's dog's gonna be hard to beat. Look at him bring in the sheep! One sheep, two sheep ...  ... three sheep."
3, 39, "Leela", "The dog's good, but our real competition is the Hypno-Toad.  Your turn, Nibbler, honey. Herd those sheep!"
3, 39, "Amy", "Come on, Nibbler!"
3, 39, "Bender", "Ma'am, I have a late entry"
3, 39, "Bender", "Faster! Faster."
3, 39, "Zoidberg", "Ow!"
3, 39, "Bender", "Suck in that gut! You wanna be spayed?"
3, 39, "Bender", "Silence, you cur! Puff out that brisket!"
3, 39, "Bender", "I should be weeping! I'm not weeping!"
3, 39, "Fry", "I love these things!"
3, 39, "Leela", "Shake paws, Nibbler. Come on, shake.  He might be a little hungry. Shake, boy. Usually he's had more ham by now. Shake!"
3, 39, "Judge #1", "Third prize, a party-sized keg of guinea pigs, goes to Dave Spiegel and his owner, Fluffers.  Second prize, this lovely afghan made from an Afghan, goes to Bender and his wooping terrier."
3, 39, "Bender", "Second place?  That's a fancy word for losing.  You didn't stick your landing!"
3, 39, "Zoidberg", "Forgive me, my friend."
3, 39, "Bender", "Never!"
3, 39, "Judge #1", "And before we announce the winner we have a special award for a first-time contestant"
3, 39, "Leela", "Me? Award? Him? Me? Good?"
3, 39, "Judge #1", "That's just the kind of eloquence you'd expect from the owner of Dumbest Pet in Show.  And the grand prize winner ...   ... the Hypno-Toad.  All glory to the Hypno-Toad."
3, 39, "Leela", "Maybe they're right. Maybe Nibbler is dumb."
3, 39, "Fry", "Don't listen to them, Leela. People said I was dumb, but I proved them."
3, 39, "Farnsworth", "Good news, everyone! We were supposed to make a delivery to the planet Tweenis 12 but it's been completely destroyed."
3, 39, "Leela", "Why is that good news?"
3, 39, "Farnsworth", "They paid in advance."
3, 39, "Bender", "Excuse me."
3, 39, "Hermes", "This is mighty strange.  First, the civilisation of Space Rome collapsed, then Don Martin 3 went kaflooie and now Tweenis 12."
3, 39, "Fry", "Looks like this planet is next in line."
3, 39, "Leela", "That's Earth.  The planet we live on."
3, 39, "Fry", "I'd hate to be those guys."
3, 39, "Hermes", "What's got into him? He's twitching like Zoidberg when someone mentions the word ""food""."
3, 39, "Zoidberg", "What, now?"
3, 39, "Leela", "No! Nibbler, come back!"
3, 39, "Leela", "Too bad Nibbler's not around. I guess I'll have to eat this raw, dripping ham by myself.  Nibbler?  Nibbler, you're scaring me.  Nibbler?  Am I going crazy? Have my years of wild hedonism finally caught up with me?   Nibbler, help! Don't leave me here.  Uh, Nibbler? Could you scooch the seat up just a little bit?"
3, 39, "Fry", "Leela back yet?"
3, 39, "Bender", "Fry, help me! My heart stopped beating!"
3, 39, "Fry", "You don't have a heart; you're a robot."
3, 39, "Bender", "Sure ... right. Robot!  Oh, Fry! My skin's all dry and clanky."
3, 39, "Fry", "Well, yeah. Robots are made of metal."
3, 39, "Bender", "Am I a robot?"
3, 39, "Fry", "Bender, if this is some kind of scam, I don't get it. You already have my power of attorney."
3, 39, "Bender", "Fry!  My skin!"
3, 39, "Farnsworth", "Ow. Ow. Ow.  I'm a genius. Ow. Ow."
3, 39, "Fry", "Dr. Zoidberg, why is everyone acting so weird?"
3, 39, "Zoidberg", "Zoidy want balloon! Want balloon now!  Zoidy want go outside!"
3, 39, "Fry", "I just let you back in!"
3, 39, "Leela", "This is unbelievable. I thought you were a furry little moron. But here you are flying an adorable spaceship. If only you could talk.  Wait! I understood that!  You say you're transmitting your thoughts directly to my brain.  You say those awful flying brains are making everyone on Earth stupid?  Oh, stupider. And you go on to say that we're headed for your home planet where your race has lived since the beginning of the universe?  So, how did the universe begin?  Then the meaning of existence--  So every religion is wrong!"
3, 39, "Linda", "You fell!  Hi! Today some bad things happened. One bad thing was a train got crashed in New Jersey. Wanna see?  People won't be late for work though, because the governor lady said,  ""I'm sending in more trains!"""
3, 39, "Woman", "Go!"
3, 39, "Man", "Wait for me! Wait for me!"
3, 39, "Morbo", "Morbo can't understand his TelePrompTer. He forgot how you say that letter that looks like a man with a hat."
3, 39, "Linda", "It's a ""T"". It goes ""tuh""."
3, 39, "Morbo", "Hello, little man. I will destroy you!"
3, 39, "Fry", "Man, even the news monster is acting strange. What are we gonna do?"
3, 39, "Farnsworth", "Duh, I know! Let's play the lottery!"
3, 39, "Amy", "No. Let's buy Internet stock!"
3, 39, "Zoidberg", "On margin! Zoidy wanna buy on margin!"
3, 39, "Hermes", "Look at me! I'm invisible!"
3, 39, "Fry", "Wait a minute! I know what's going on here. You've all become idiots!"
3, 39, "Bender", "Hey, let's all join the Reform Party!"
3, 39, "Hermes", "Oh, yeah!"
3, 39, "Ken", "Welcome back, Lord Nibbler, Ambassador to Earth, homeworld of the pizza bagel."
3, 39, "Nibbler", "Thank you. I bear many receipts for reimbursement."
3, 39, "Fiona", "The four welcomes of friendship to you as well, Leela. We shall manipulate your mind so we appear to be speaking your language. Do not be afraid, my child."
3, 39, "Leela", "I'm not afraid."
3, 39, "Fiona", "Uh, good. Good."
3, 39, "Leela", "So, your real name is Lord Nibbler? That's a coincidence."
3, 39, "Nibbler", "That name is for your sake. In the time it would take to pronounce one letter of my true name, a trillion cosmoses would flair into existence and sink into eternal night."
3, 39, "Leela", "Oh, you're all so cute!"
3, 39, "Ken", "No, we're not.  We Nibblonians are an ancient and powerful race. Behold.  When the universe was forged in the crucible of the Big Bang, our mighty race was already 17 years old."
3, 39, "Leela", "Aww!"
3, 39, "Ken", "For the first millisecond of time, things were OK. But then there arose a terrible enemy"
3, 39, "Nibblonian Chef", "Lunch is ready."
3, 39, "Ken", "Then let the feast of a thousand hams begin."
3, 39, "Leela", "So why are these Brain Spawn attacking Earth, Nibbler?"
3, 39, "Nibbler", "The Brain Spawn hate all consciousness. The thoughts of others screech at them like the forced laughs of a billion art house movie patrons."
3, 39, "Ken", "Thus, they travel from world to world making everyone stupid in order to wipe out all thought in the universe."
3, 39, "Leela", "Wipe out all thought? My God! They're like flying televisions."
3, 39, "Fiona", "And even we are powerless to stop them, fearsome though we are."
3, 39, "Nibbler", "There is but one being who can resist them. A child of destiny whose bizarre brain wave pattern makes him immune to the Brain Spawn attack.  He is the hope of the universe.  The fate of your world, perhaps all worlds, rests in his special mind."
3, 39, "Leela", "Now, when you say ""special""..."
3, 39, "Fry", "Attention, New New Yorkers. Stop acting so stupid!"
3, 39, "Ken", "Nibblonian fleet holding at perimeter of moron zone, formerly known as ""Earth""."
3, 39, "Leela", "Why would Fry be immune to the flying brains? Because he doesn't shower?"
3, 39, "Fiona", "The Brain Spawn suppress intelligence by attacking the delta brain wave. Every animal and robot in the universe generates this wave, as do certain trees."
3, 39, "Nibbler", "Fry, however, does not."
3, 39, "Fiona", "Somehow he has cobbled together a random assortment of other brain waves into a working mind."
3, 39, "Leela", "Like a prom dress made from carpet remnants."
3, 39, "Nibbler", "Yes, like your prom dress."
3, 39, "Ken", "The Brain Spawn are commanded by a giant, evil brain with a gooey centre of pure hate."
3, 39, "Fiona", "Only Fry, with his superior, yet inferior mind, can approach him. You must tell him to disable it. We will do the rest."
3, 39, "Leela", "You can count on me."
3, 39, "Fiona", "No, we can't. Once on Earth, you will be too stupid to remember the message."
3, 39, "Nibbler", "That's why we wrote it down for you."
3, 39, "Ken", "We've also prepared a bag lunch and some mittens."
3, 39, "Fry", "Time to re-educate you dunce-bags. We'll start with US presidents.  This was our first president, George Washington.  Let's review. Who was our first president?"
3, 39, "Amy", "Um."
3, 39, "Bender", "A pickle jar?"
3, 39, "Washington", "Thomas Jefferson?"
3, 39, "Fry", "Leela! I've been so worried. Are you a bonehead?"
3, 39, "Leela", "I ... have to tell ... must ... important ... something--"
3, 39, "Fry", "Whoa, whoa! Slow down. You're going a mile a minute."
3, 39, "Leela", "This! You for this!"
3, 39, "Fry", "Thanks!"
3, 39, "Leela", "No!  Ow! Fire hot."
3, 39, "Farnsworth", "The professy will help!  Fire indeed hot!"
3, 39, "Arthur", "Oh! Chester A. Arthur fall down."
3, 39, "Leela", "Brain. Brain make people dumb."
3, 39, "Fry", "No, Leela. Brain make people smart."
3, 39, "Leela", "You go fight biggest brain of all."
3, 39, "Fry", "Even bigger than those? Holy nuts! Where is it?"
3, 39, "Leela", "I 'unno!"
3, 39, "Fry", "Hm. A giant brain is basically a giant nerd. And where would a giant nerd be?  The libary!"
3, 39, "Big Brain", "Pathetic human race. Arranging their knowledge by category just made it easier to absorb. Dewey, you fool, your decimal system has played right into my hands!  What do you want?"
3, 39, "Fry", "I'm here to kick your ass."
3, 39, "Big Brain", "Wishful thinking. We have long since evolved beyond the need for asses.  Odd. My stupefaction field is having no effect on your ability to think."
3, 39, "Fry", "That's right. And I think you'll find that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing!  OK, better think of a new plan. Come on, Fry, think!  Thinking ... thinking..."
3, 39, "Big Brain", "Oh! Stop that!"
3, 39, "Fry", "Hey! Thinking hurts him. Maybe I can think of a way to use that.  Aha! Prepare to be thought at. Leela, give me a topic."
3, 39, "Leela", "Duh..."
3, 39, "Fry", "Seriously, I can't think of anything.  Gotta find something to make me think. Hardy Boys, too easy. Nancy Drew, too hard. Aha! Perfect! Bonfire of the Vanities!"
3, 39, "Big Brain", "No! It's unbearable!"
3, 39, "Fiona", "The brains are weakening.  Nibblonians to Nibble stations. Prepare cuddle bug for deployment in 40 nibblets."
3, 39, "Nibbler", "Sometimes I fear we are cute."
3, 39, "Fiona", "Oh, niggle-snoosh!"
3, 39, "Fry", "Take that! And that! This sentence I don't understand but take this one!"
3, 39, "Big Brain", "You have not won yet.  Each book in this room is a gateway to a mental realm and I shall take you there and imprison you forever."
3, 39, "Leela", "Icky!"
3, 39, "Fry", "Where are we?"
3, 39, "Ahab", "A gold doubloon to the man who first spies the white whale."
3, 39, "Queequeg", "Big whale over there."
3, 39, "Ahab", "Arr! I saw it first!"
3, 39, "Queequeg", "Wait! That no white whale. It grey, think-y whale!"
3, 39, "Fry", "Queequeg, let go of me! I have to kill it!"
3, 39, "Big Brain", "Farewell! You will all be trapped in this dense, symbolist tome forever!"
3, 39, "Fry", "Follow him! It's our only way out!"
3, 39, "Fry", "Excuse me, have you seen a giant brain?"
3, 39, "Tom Sawyer", "Yep. I let him help me whitewash Aunt Polly's fence."
3, 39, "Big Brain", "Tom Sawyer, you tricked me. This is less fun than previously indicated. Let this corny slice of Americana be your tomb for all eternity."
3, 39, "Tom Sawyer", "Please, no!"
3, 39, "Fry", "Come on!"
3, 39, "Woman", "Mr. Fry, Mama tells us you're quite the oddity; a bachelor at your age."
3, 39, "Fry", "You think I'm an oddity? Wait'll you see--"
3, 39, "Butler", "Presenting the most eligible landowner in all Hertfordshire, Mr. Brainly."
3, 39, "Big Brain", "I'm a gigantic brain!"
3, 39, "Man #1", "I say!"
3, 39, "Man #2", "Most un-gentleman-like!"
3, 39, "Woman", "Mr. Brainly, what news have you of the London season?"
3, 39, "Big Brain", "Well--"
3, 39, "Fry", "Hey, Brain-y! Think fast!"
3, 39, "Big Brain", "I always think fast."
3, 39, "Ahab", "The whale! He be white now!"
3, 39, "Fry", "Leela, I've got an idea. Stay here with Queequeg."
3, 39, "Leela", "Is there Mrs. Queequeg?"
3, 39, "Fry", "Yes! I'm free!  Alright, Brain. Get ready for some electroshock treatment!"
3, 39, "Leela", "Fry, don't die! Wake up!   Nooo!"
3, 39, "Fry", "Leela cried for her lost love as Fry lay dead under the heavy bookcase. The Big Brain laughed in triumph...  Then, for no reason, he left Earth forever. The end.  There!  Now he's trapped in a book I wrote; a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors."
3, 39, "Big Brain", "The Big Brain am winning again. I am the greetest!  Now I am leaving Earth for no raeson!"
3, 39, "Nibbler", "The Big Brain is defeated. Let what must be done be done."
3, 39, "Leela", "Me ... feel ... a bit better in cognitive faculties."
3, 39, "Fry", "I did it!  And it's all thanks to the books at my local library."
3, 39, "Nibbler", "And so life returned to normal, or as normal as it gets on this primitive dirtball inhabited by psychotic apes."
3, 39, "Nibbler", "Thanks to the effect of the brain rays, the people of Earth had no memory of what had transpired, except Fry, and no one believed him or cared what he had to say."
3, 39, "Nibbler", "I, meanwhile, returned to my post, ever vigilant, lest Earth again come under Brain attack. And when that day comes, God help us. God help us all."
3, 39, "Leela", "Time for a diap-y change!"
3, 39, "Nibbler", "End transmission."
3, 40, "Humorbot 5.0", "So I says, ""Super collider? I just met her!""  And then they built the super collider. Thank you, you've been a great audience."
3, 40, "Florp", "Humorbot 5.0, ladies and gentlemen. Our next stand-up's a veteran of four comedy traffic schools. Give it way up for Bobcat Zoidberg!"
3, 40, "Fry", "Alright!"
3, 40, "Leela", "Yeah!"
3, 40, "Bender", "Alright, Zoidberg!"
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "Earth"
3, 40, "Bender", "Reload."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "So these three parasitic worms bore into a human's head--"
3, 40, "Woman #1", "Ew, gross."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "And they walk up to the bar and then-- Uh-oh.  Wait, stop! I've got more!"
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "My whole life I worked on that act. And they hated it."
3, 40, "Hermes", "You're a crazy, penniless, lobster doctor. No combination of you should be a comedian."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "But comedy is in my valves. My Uncle Harold was a big Hollywood star back in the era of silent holograms."
3, 40, "Leela", "Your uncle was Harold Zoid?"
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "This I cannot deny."
3, 40, "Farnsworth", "Why, I've been a Harold Zoid fan since back when my hips were made of bone. As it happens, I still have some of my original 78s."
3, 40, "Hermes", "You're right, crabby. He's a hell of a lot funnier than you could ever be."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "Maybe so, but perhaps if I wrote him and asked for a few hundred pointers..."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "This letter has to be very personal, so I'm writing it in my own ink.   Dear Uncle Zoid, greetings from your long-lost nephew. Norm and Sam and Sadie's boy, remember?"
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "Now I am the most important doctor at the delivery company where I work. But, sadly, my life is bereft of laughter."
3, 40, "Zoid", "I beg of you, Mr. Funny Uncle, teach me the comedy business. Sincerely, Zoidberg.  Oy, isn't that nice? He took the time."
3, 40, "Woman #2", "What's that scribbledy-gook?"
3, 40, "Zoid", "This is a fan letter from my rich doctor nephew, who just might be my ticket out of this flophouse, he might.  Yeah, you'd better run.  Dear Rich Doctor Nephew, I can help you be funny. The first funny thing you must do is put all your money in the form of a cashier's check and come to Hollywood."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "Sincerely, Harold Zoid. P.S. Cashier's check.  Did you hear that? I'm going to Hollywood!"
3, 40, "Tour Guide", "Welcome to Hollywood! I must warn you, there's no refund if you get discovered and leave the tour!  I'm just kidding, that never happens. Now, to your right, you'll see 30th Century Fox Studios.  Fox uses those searchlights to blind pilots, then film the resulting plane crashes."
3, 40, "Bender", "Neat!"
3, 40, "Tour Guide", "Ahead, you'll see the home of Mel Gibson, star of the hit film, Bravehead.  And do we have any fans of Calculon, star of the robot soap opera All My Circuits?"
3, 40, "Bender", "Oh! I am! Me!  Bender is!"
3, 40, "Tour Guide", "Then you'll wanna get a close look at his luxurious Bel-Air home."
3, 40, "Bender", "Yes, I will."
3, 40, "Calculon", "Are you my new hot water heater?"
3, 40, "Bender", "No, I'm Bender. We met once, remember?"
3, 40, "Calculon", "Absolutely not."
3, 40, "Bender", "Come on, don't you remember how much I was bugging you, don't you? 'Cause it was a lot, you remember, right?"
3, 40, "Calculon", "Look, I'm programmed to be very busy. Unless you can heat water to 212 degrees, I'm not interested.  Have you got an extra GOTO 10 line? I said I don't need a bender."
3, 40, "Bender", "Bender? That was the other guy. My name's Boiler."
3, 40, "Calculon", "Nice work, Boiler."
3, 40, "Bender", "Thanks. And call me Bender."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "That's where I'm meeting Uncle Zoid for lunch to discuss my Hollywood dreams. Next time you see me, don't be surprised if I've eaten."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "Uncle Zoid, you're looking young enough to be thrown back!"
3, 40, "Zoid", "Rich nephew, come over here and give your uncle a nice, big meal.  So, here we are"
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "And a rich, respected doctor with many surviving patients."
3, 40, "Zoid", "Eating real food in a restaurant, as we both often do. So, you want to be a comedian, is it?"
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "It's my lifelong dream."
3, 40, "Zoid", "Well that dream dies now.  You're unfunny and untalented. That's why you're perfect for drama."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "Hmm. Serious drama. Perhaps it is time to give up comedy."
3, 40, "Zoid", "I'm putting together a big drama picture right now, as we speak. The script is dynamite. I know because I wrote it myself. And with me directing and starring, I'll be back on top after 50 miserable years--  Uh, of fame."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "Ah, fame. Where do I come in?"
3, 40, "Zoid", "This fame film has a juicy part for you, if you completely finance it with your doctor money. So, are you in?"
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "Uh, OK. How much do I have to invest?"
3, 40, "Zoid", "Oh, not much, not much,  A million dollars.   Then it's settled. Another blockbuster Hollywood deal."
3, 40, "Waiter", "What can I get you gentlemen?"
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "Is bread free?"
3, 40, "Waiter", "Yeah."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "We'll split an order."
3, 40, "Bender", "What's with Monstro?"
3, 40, "Fry", "He promised he'd give his Uncle Zoid a million bucks to make a movie."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "I've only been here a day and already I'm a Hollywood phoney."
3, 40, "Bender", "Well, perhaps I could call on TV's Calculon to help, now that I'm in showbiz."
3, 40, "Fry", "Since when have you been in the biz?"
3, 40, "Bender", "Long enough, little man. Long enough."
3, 40, "Bender", "Calculon, as your hot water heater ...  ... I would be remiss if I didn't bring you scripts that could make you an international film star."
3, 40, "Calculon", "Of course. Tell me about the project."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "It's a movie."
3, 40, "Calculon", "Interesting. Tell me more."
3, 40, "Bender", "Get this"
3, 40, "Calculon", "And?"
3, 40, "Bender", "And, uh, I guarantee it'll win you an Oscar."
3, 40, "Calculon", "An Oscar, you say? That would get me out of this festering rat's nest called ""television"" once and for all. Let me see the script.  No. No, I don't like the font.  Wait! Harold Zoid? Was this written by the Harold Zoid?"
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "Written and Xeroxed."
3, 40, "Calculon", "Good heavens! A chance to work with the legendary Harold Zoid. He's one of my great idols. And-And you say you can guarantee me the Oscar?"
3, 40, "Bender", "I can guarantee anything you want."
3, 40, "Calculon", "Then I'll do it!"
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "Hooray!"
3, 40, "Bender", "Here's your chequebook."
3, 40, "Calculon", "Ladies and gentlemen, I give you our director, the legendary Harold Zoid!"
3, 40, "Zoid", "Thank you. A more classic movie plot there isn't"
3, 40, "Bender", "That plot makes perfect sense. Wink, wink."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "Bender, you said ""wink, wink"" out loud."
3, 40, "Bender", "No, I didn't. Raise middle finger."
3, 40, "Zoid", "Now remember, and I can't stress this enough, this is a talkie, so I want the full gamut of emotions from every actor in every scene."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "The Magnificent Three. Scene one, take one."
3, 40, "Zoid", "And, action!"
3, 40, "Calculon", "Take back your gilded pen, Father. Signing bills into law was always your dream, not mine."
3, 40, "Zoid", "Cut! Cut! Cut it!  I said this is a talkie, damnit! You've got to emote more! And you extras, wave your arms and make faces. What is this, a morgue?"
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "The Magnificent Three. Scene 10, take 95."
3, 40, "Zoid", "Action. And I mean circus-grade action."
3, 40, "Calculon", "Sir, I call upon you not as a President but as a father."
3, 40, "Zoid", "Cut, cut, cut it!  Would you show a little emotion?  People, people, please. Just because it's a dramatic scene, doesn't mean you can't do a little comedy in the background.  Throw a pie or two, for God's sake."
3, 40, "Calculon", "Nooo!"
3, 40, "Zoid", "Cut, cut it! Eck! Look, look, it's alright, kid. We'll, uh, we'll get it in editing. Alright, that's a wrap, everybody. I'm gonna see you all at the premiere which, by the way, when is?"
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "Well, editing is a long and expensive process but we spent all the money on pies, so it'll be ready Friday."
3, 40, "Bender", "Nice turnout, Calculon. That Oscar's practically on your mantel."
3, 40, "Calculon", "I just pray they like me half as much as I do."
3, 40, "Calculon", "I agreed to be your Vice President but I never agreed to be your son.  Thank you, Lieutenant Smith."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "Good morning, Mr. Vice President!"
3, 40, "Fry", "Leela, we're missing the premiere.  My only goal in life was to attend a Hollywood shindig. Just pay the valet the two bucks."
3, 40, "Leela", "No! It's the principle of the thing. Besides, I think I see a parking lot up ahead."
3, 40, "Calculon", "Father, I've asked you to join me on the White House roof so we could have a heart-to-heart talk. I will never follow in your footsteps. Here is my resignation as Vice President."
3, 40, "Zoid", "No! My son will not shame me like this. I would sooner die, I would!"
3, 40, "Calculon", "Father! The ledge!"
3, 40, "Zoid", "Oy!"
3, 40, "Calculon", "Oh!"
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "The President is dead. Congratulations, Mr. President!"
3, 40, "Calculon", "Nooo!"
3, 40, "Bender", "Woo-hoo! Yeah! He's a visionary!"
3, 40, "Calculon", "Everyone walked out. They hated it. I've seen plagues that had better opening nights than this. You said that Oscar was practically on my mantel."
3, 40, "Bender", "Now you know why I use the qualifier, ""practically""."
3, 40, "Calculon", "You listen to me. I'm out a million bucks here! You get me that Oscar or you're dead! You and these snivelling lobsters! Dead. You hear me? Dead!"
3, 40, "Zoid", "Oy, now he emotes!"
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "Let's just hope Calculon breaks our legs; they'll grow back."
3, 40, "Zoid", "He's gonna kill us, you klutzel! Who told that under-acting stiff he was going to get an Oscar?"
3, 40, "Bender", "Me. It seemed like the least honest way to get him to pay for the movie."
3, 40, "Zoid", "He paid?  I though you paid, with your big-shot doctor money."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "I lied."
3, 40, "Zoid", "OK, enough with the blubbering, already. The way I directed the hell out of him, he may still very well get the nomination."
3, 40, "Bender", "Wink."
3, 40, "Calculon", "400 categories and not a single nomination for me."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "But you won this Golden Globe!"
3, 40, "Calculon", "Piffle! That's the Emmy of movie awards! [He throws it towards Bender. He dodges it and it hits an All My Circuits"
3, 40, "Bender", "Then maybe you should act better."
3, 40, "Calculon", "The Oscar isn't about acting. It's about earning the respect and admiration of the creative community."
3, 40, "Zoid", "How 'bout we rig the awards?"
3, 40, "Calculon", "That's fine too."
3, 40, "Leela", "It's no use. The tar is too thick. Plus, I think I flooded it."
3, 40, "Fry", "Well, we missed the premiere and we're gonna die. We might as well enjoy the sights.  Oh, my God! Sylvester Stallone!"
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "This is where you live? I though you were a big-shot Hollywood movie star."
3, 40, "Zoid", "No, I'm not. I'm an even bigger liar than you. My career went down the tubes the day they invented smell-a-vision."
3, 40, "Bender", "Calculon's gonna kill us for sure. It's all everybody else's fault."
3, 40, "Zoid", "Oy. All I wanted was for people to think of me one last time before I die."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "What are you talking about, Uncle? Everybody remembers Harold Zoid!"
3, 40, "Zoid", "As a pathetic has-been, they remember me. As a forgotten relic, they remember me. Bah! It's better to die now."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "No. This is one death Dr. Zoidberg won't be responsible for. Zoidberg away!"
3, 40, "Rivers", "Hi, I'm Joan Rivers' head. I tell you, I've had so many face-lifts, they finally lifted it right off my body! It's true, it's true! Oh, oh, oh! Here comes Jack Nicholson's DNA reconstituted in a gorilla body."
3, 40, "Bender", "Catering."
3, 40, "Rivers", "Oh, and here's washed-up actor, whatshisname, Harold Zoid. Are you presenting one of those tacky honorary awards, or just getting one?"
3, 40, "Zoid", "I'm a seat-filler, Joan's head. My only marketable skill is to occupy space."
3, 40, "Calculon", "You know, the second I don't win that award, you're cat food. Right, Boxy?"
3, 40, "Announcer", "And now, the host of the 1074th Academy Awards, Billy Crystal."
3, 40, "Crystal", "Now I know how a Pez dispenser feels.  Oh, you like that one, Jack?  Alright, we're already one hour behind.  Our first award tonight"
3, 40, "Fry", "It's been two weeks. You wanna play tic-tac-toe again before we eat our shoes?"
3, 40, "Leela", "Oh, I always knew I'd die at the bottom of a pit. But a pit full of tar?"
3, 40, "Fry", "What was that? A tar dolphin or a tar shark?"
3, 40, "Leela", "It's some kind of hollow tube, devoid of human life.  The Los Angeles subway! We can blast our way in and escape!"
3, 40, "Fry", "Alright, but I still feel like having a shoe."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "What category are they on?"
3, 40, "Bender", "They're giving out the minor technical awards. I think they're up to writing."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "That just leaves Best Soft-Drink Product Placement and then Best Actor. We don't have much time."
3, 40, "Crystal", "And the nominees for Best Soft-Drink Product Placement are"
3, 40, "Slurm Machine", "Star Trek"
3, 40, "Bender", "And now to present the award for Best Actor ...  ... a bit player in the flop movie The Magnificent Three ...  ... Dr. Zoidberg."
3, 40, "Calculon", "OK, Boxy, keep your prong on the trigger."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "And the nominees for Best Actor are"
3, 40, "Man #1", "Uh-oh, he read the wrong name."
3, 40, "Man #2", "Shh, just play along, like they did for Marisa Tomei."
3, 40, "Zoid", "Hooray, I won't be murdered. I'll live another day. Another day of ... pathetic, forgotten misery."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "And the winner is...  And the winner, instead of any of the nominees, is the legendary Harold Zoid!"
3, 40, "Zoid", "Thank you. Thank you so much! You know, through all my ups and downs, I always thought the most important thing in life was to win an Oscar. But tonight I realise what's really important is to win two Oscars. Ha! Ha! I'm kidding, I'm kidding. What really matters in life is that people care about you, whether it's a whole crowd ...  ... or just one die-hard fan."
3, 40, "Zoid", "Thank you, nephew.  Now I can die happy. 10 seconds from now, when Calculon kills us."
3, 40, "Calculon", "Harold Zoid!"
3, 40, "Bender", "Hit the deck!"
3, 40, "Calculon", "Where's that Oscar?"
3, 40, "Zoid", "Here, enjoy. What are you getting upset? It's slightly less fraudulent for you to have it."
3, 40, "Calculon", "Yes. Yes, it's a real beauty. Someday I hope to win one of my own."
3, 40, "Bender", "Then you're not going to kill us, Your Majesty?"
3, 40, "Calculon", "Nay. I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar."
3, 40, "Zoidberg", "Earthquake!"
3, 40, "Bender", "Hit the deck!"
3, 40, "Zoid", "Let the earth quake, I've got somebody's Oscar!"
3, 40, "Fry", "We made it! I'm at a Hollywood party!"
3, 40, "Doorman", "I'm sorry, sir, this is a private-- Oh, pardon me, I see you're with Mr. Stallone."
3, 41, "Morbo", "So I gave the cookies you made to Fawn and the kids and they couldn't believe it -- they were delicious. But, I digress.   Tremble, puny earthlings! One day my race will destroy you all!"
3, 41, "Leela", "Could one of you guys get that?"
3, 41, "Leela", "It's a doorbell baby!  Hello, little guy. You know, I was abandoned as a baby too, so--"
3, 41, "Bender", "Garbage, huh? I'll take care of it."
3, 41, "Leela", "Bender, stop! It's a baby!"
3, 41, "Bender", "A baby what?  Ow!"
3, 41, "Leela", "Oh, it's just a card. From the orphanarium I grew up in."
3, 41, "Card", "Leela, you're invited to a reunion at Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium.  Please stand clear of self-destructing basket."
3, 41, "Bender", "A reunion at your old orphanarium, eh? You gonna go?"
3, 41, "Leela", "No way, Jose-bot. I never wanna see those other orphans again! Not after the way they used to pick on me."
3, 41, "Kids", "One-eye! One-eye! One-eye!"
3, 41, "Kirk", "Nice depth-perception, one-eye!"
3, 41, "Leela", "How can you make fun of me, Kirk? You're blind!"
3, 41, "Kirk", "My eyes may not work, but at least I got two of them!"
3, 41, "Fry", "Aww. That's terrible, Leela. But imagine the look on their faces when you show up with two friends who eat all the hors d'Oeuvres."
3, 41, "Leela", "Well, I wouldn't mind rubbing my success in a few choice faces."
3, 41, "Bender", "Set a course for adventure!"
3, 41, "Fry", "Ew!"
3, 41, "Bender", "What a dump!"
3, 41, "Leela", "Just like old times. Gosh! The bars on the windows seemed so much thicker back then.  Mr. Vogel? Remember me?"
3, 41, "Vogel", "Leela! You're worthless and no one will ever love you!"
3, 41, "Leela", "You used to say that all the time!"
3, 41, "Vogel", "Oh, those were happier days."
3, 41, "Fry", "Mmm! The gristle-in-a-blanket isn't half bad."
3, 41, "Bender", "And try one of these Popsicle sticks. They've absorbed quite a bit of flavour."
3, 41, "Leela", "Hey, look. It's our old group picture."
3, 41, "Fry", "I don't see you anywhere."
3, 41, "Leela", "That's me over in Cootietown."
3, 41, "Bender", "Whoa! Get a load of this average-looking guy!"
3, 41, "Leela", "That's Adlai Atkins. I used to have kind of a crush on him."
3, 41, "Kids", "One-eye! One-eye!"
3, 41, "French Guy", "Stupid as a French guy!"
3, 41, "Kids", "One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye!"
3, 41, "Leela", "Well, it's time to say hello to the old gang."
3, 41, "Man #1", "So, whatcha been up to since you left the orphanarium?"
3, 41, "Man #2", "Uh, living in a box, fighting the shakes. You?"
3, 41, "Man #1", "Selling kidneys, teeth, whatever falls out of me."
3, 41, "Leela", "And what am I up to, you ask? Why, I'm a very successful space captain."
3, 41, "Man #2", "Oh."
3, 41, "Man #1", "Wow."
3, 41, "Man #3", "How nice for you, Leela."
3, 41, "Woman", "That's so good for a person with one eye."
3, 41, "Leela", "Hey! You can't feel sorry for me! I'm a space captain and you're a bunch of losers."
3, 41, "Man #1", "Uh, right, right. We're the losers!"
3, 41, "Kirk", "Well, if it isn't old one-eye!"
3, 41, "Leela", "Oh, yeah? Well, shut up, cane boy!"
3, 41, "Man #3", "He can't hear you. He's deaf now."
3, 41, "Adlai", "Leave Leela alone. She's leading a perfectly normal life. She's not gussied up, duded out, getting down or where it's at. Now run along."
3, 41, "Leela", "Thanks, Adlai. I guess you never really outgrow being an eyeball-- Oddball!"
3, 41, "Adlai", "Nonsense. You're a space captain. That's a fine, conventional profession."
3, 41, "Leela", "Well, you know, it's just for a package delivery service."
3, 41, "Adlai", "Ah-ah. A package is just a box until it's delivered."
3, 41, "Leela", "Huh. I'd never thought of it that way. So what do you do these days?"
3, 41, "Adlai", "Oh, I'm a doctor."
3, 41, "Leela", "A tall doctor, you say?"
3, 41, "Vogel", "Sir, you seem pretty stable. Have you thought about adopting one of our kids?"
3, 41, "Fry", "Sure haven't."
3, 41, "Vogel", "Well keep adoption in mind. It's a great way to have a kid without having sex."
3, 41, "Fry", "Really?"
3, 41, "Vogel", "Plus, the government will help out with a small stipend of $100 a week."
3, 41, "Bender", "$100 a week?"
3, 41, "Adlai", "I'm so sorry I teased you back then. Let me make it up to you. I can fix it so no one ever makes fun of you again."
3, 41, "Leela", "You mean by beating them up? Because I've broken that blind kid's nose like 10 times and it doesn't make any difference."
3, 41, "Adlai", "No, I specialise in phaser eye surgery. I can build you a paraffin eye and graft it on with skin from your foot. It won't be able to see but you'll look like a perfectly normal two-eyed person."
3, 41, "Leela", "Me? Perfectly normal?"
3, 41, "Bender", "Sons, daughters, meet Uncle Fry."
3, 41, "Fry", "Hey, why are those kids following you? Do you have candy stuck to your ass?"
3, 41, "Bender", "No. It's called ""parenting"". Come on, dumplings. We've got 12 government stipends to collect."
3, 41, "Boy", "Our daddy's a giant toy!"
3, 41, "Farnsworth", "Phaser eye surgery is a capital idea. I'm sure Leela's tired of morons gaping at her eye all the time."
3, 41, "Amy", "I think cosmetic surgery's great, Leela. I used to be too cute, so I had cuteness-reduction surgery here ...  ... and here."
3, 41, "Fry", "You guys are crazy. Leela doesn't need surgery. You look great the way you are."
3, 41, "Leela", "Oh, that's so sweet, Fry. But for once in my life, I just wanna look normal."
3, 41, "Fry", "But you're better than normal, you're abnormal. If you ask me, you shouldn't care what other people think."
3, 41, "Leela", "You're right! I'll start by not caring what you think!  I'm getting the surgery."
3, 41, "Farnsworth", "That a girl!"
3, 41, "Amy", "Right on!"
3, 41, "Zoidberg", "Wonderful. And while you're under the knife, you could also get an ink pouch to help you escape your enemies."
3, 41, "Farnsworth", "That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard, you imbecile!"
3, 41, "Adlai", "Now we'll find out if the operation was a success. Hold on to your hats.  Oh, I'm sorry, this is the wrong patient.  Oops."
3, 41, "Amy", "Leela, those eyes look so great on you."
3, 41, "Fry", "Bah! I think she looked fine before."
3, 41, "Farnsworth", "No."
3, 41, "Zoidberg", "No."
3, 41, "Amy", "Uh-uh."
3, 41, "Hermes", "Wrong."
3, 41, "Leela", "Wow, look at me. Although I don't have the hang of blinking yet."
3, 41, "Adlai", "You'll get it. Personally, I try not to blink too much because it seems flashy. But when I do, I enjoy it."
3, 41, "Leela", "I did it! I blunk!"
3, 41, "Hermes", "And just in time to screw up this picture I took!"
3, 41, "Leela", "Hooray!"
3, 41, "Walt", "Ow!"
3, 41, "Igner", "Ow!"
3, 41, "Larry", "Ow!"
3, 41, "Leela", "I've never felt so unremarkable! Today I actually blended in with a crowd!"
3, 41, "Bender", "Kids, meet the jerkbags I work with."
3, 41, "Kids", "Hello, jerkbags!"
3, 41, "Amy", "Oh, they're so cute! What are their names?"
3, 41, "Bender", "Kids have names?"
3, 41, "Nina", "My name's Nina, and his name's Albert--"
3, 41, "Bender", "And from now on, you're all named Bender Jr.!  Lookie here! My first government stipend cheque! 12 baby humans, 1200 wing-wangs!"
3, 41, "Sally", "Daddy Bender, we're hungry."
3, 41, "Bender", "What is it with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food!  Oh, fine. I'll get you some stupid food."
3, 41, "Albert", "Can we have Bender burgers again?"
3, 41, "Bender", "No. The cat shelter's on to me!"
3, 41, "Adlai", "Hello, Leela. I was in a nearby tailor getting one of my Hawai'ian shirts toned down, so I thought I'd drop in for your follow-up exam."
3, 41, "Leela", "Oh. That's so handsome of you."
3, 41, "Adlai", "Just follow the light with your eyes.  Perfect! You know, a guy could fall head-over-heels for a gal like you.  As for me, I'm somewhat interested myself."
3, 41, "Leela", "What are you saying?"
3, 41, "Adlai", "I've never been good with words, which is why I'm in such a delicate conundrum. Will you go out with me this Sunday?"
3, 41, "Leela", "Sure!"
3, 41, "Adlai", "I don't know what else to say, so I'll just say it. Okey-dokey, see you then."
3, 41, "Fry", "This is so unfair! I liked you back when you were a cyclops! That guy's only interested now that you have two eyes."
3, 41, "Leela", "You're just jealous!"
3, 41, "Fry", "No, I'm not! Oh, wait, I am. But my point remains valid!"
3, 41, "Leela", "Fry, I just wanna try dating a normal man, who if you go somewhere with him no one says he's crummy. I think I deserve that once in life."
3, 41, "Zoidberg", "Be careful with that Adlai, Leela, he's a doctor, they're very poor."
3, 41, "Leela", "Actually, most doctors are rich."
3, 41, "Zoidberg", "What? When did this happen? You're joking, right?  That's not funny!"
3, 41, "Bender", "OK, they've got everything you need here"
3, 41, "Albert", "Yeah."
3, 41, "Bender", "Then knock yourself out.  Hey! Hey! Only eat and drink enough to barely keep yourselves alive! I'm trying to make a profit here."
3, 41, "Nina", "Daddy! Bethany's hitting me!"
3, 41, "Bender", "Here."
3, 41, "Fembot", "These kids yours?"
3, 41, "Bender", "Yeah."
3, 41, "Fembot", "Ooh. I'm attracted to a man with responsibility!"
3, 41, "Bender", "That's me, baby! Let me just ditch the kids in an alley and we can go have some fun."
3, 41, "Boy", "Daddy Bender?"
3, 41, "Bender", "Son, daddy's trying to score with a cheap floozy right now, so we need you to cram a Tinkertoy in it!"
3, 41, "Boy", "I love you, Daddy Bender!"
3, 41, "Bender", "Hey, what the hell are you doing? Quit hugging me!"
3, 41, "Fembot", "I guess you're busy. I'll catch you later."
3, 41, "Bender", "You morons! I don't know what you're trying to pull but I got half a mind to hug each and every one of you and see how you like it!   Oh, come on!"
3, 41, "Adlai", "I thought I'd take you someplace ordinary, a place no one could object to."
3, 41, "Leela", "That sounds wonderful."
3, 41, "Man #4", "I'd like an extra-beautiful bouquet for my extra-gorgeous sweetheart."
3, 41, "Adlai", "Average, please."
3, 41, "Leela", "Oh, Adlai, I've had a wonderful time today. No one's stared at me or avoided staring at me or tried to burn me. You make me feel so not weird."
3, 41, "Adlai", "Leela, you're 999,999 in a million!"
3, 41, "Leela", "Thanks for coming out to get to know my boyfriend. Isn't he dreamy?"
3, 41, "Zoidberg", "Totally."
3, 41, "Adlai", "Uh, listen. I just want you all to know your Leela's one standard lady."
3, 41, "Leela", "Oh, Adlai, stop!"
3, 41, "Fry", "What's so wonderful about Leela being normal? The rest of us aren't normal and that's what makes us great. Like Dr. Zoidberg"
3, 41, "Zoidberg", "Damn right!"
3, 41, "Fry", "And the Professor's a senile, amoral crackpot.  Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant."
3, 41, "Hermes", "Tally me banana."
3, 41, "Fry", "Amy's a klutz from Mars."
3, 41, "Amy", "Sploops!"
3, 41, "Farnsworth", "And, Fry, you've got that brain thing."
3, 41, "Fry", "I already did! So, Leela, do you wanna be like us? Or do you wanna be like Adlai with no severe mental or social problems whatsoever?"
3, 41, "Leela", "That's the dumbest question I ever heard!"
3, 41, "Farnsworth", "She's right!"
3, 41, "Zoidberg", "No doubt about it."
3, 41, "Amy", "Duh!"
3, 41, "Hermes", "Daylight come!"
3, 41, "Bender", "Coming through, watch your heads!"
3, 41, "Zoidberg", "Help! I'm under attack!"
3, 41, "Bender", "Remember your manners, kids. Forks go in the left pocket, spoons in the right."
3, 41, "Elzar", "Which one of you cutie muffins gets the children's spicy squab?"
3, 41, "Sam", "Me!"
3, 41, "Bender", "Ah-ah-ah! What do we say when someone gives you something?"
3, 41, "Sam", "'Bout time!"
3, 41, "Bender", "That's my boy!"
3, 41, "Elzar", "And here's your check. Bam!"
3, 41, "Albert", "I gotta go poopy!"
3, 41, "Bender", "Well you should've gone poopy before it was time to run out on the check! C'mon! Go, go! Through the kitchen!"
3, 41, "Elzar", "You little crooks! If I catch you I'm going to make cutie-muffin gumbo!"
3, 41, "Adlai", "You know, seeing that strange robot force 12 children to do his bidding makes me think about kids of our own."
3, 41, "Leela", "Us? Me? You? Kids?"
3, 41, "Adlai", "That's correct. It's time to stop living this vida bachelor loca, settle down and have kids."
3, 41, "Leela", "Oh, Adlai, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!"
3, 41, "Albert", "Daddy Bender, I want a piggy back ride."
3, 41, "Bender", "Daddy's tired. Let's just have another dog-pile on Fry."
3, 41, "Sally", "Tell us a story, Daddy Bender."
3, 41, "Kids", "Story! Story! Story!"
3, 41, "Bender", "Alright, fine, gather round."
3, 41, "Nina", "We wanna hear this one again!"
3, 41, "Bender", """Bender's Arrest Record"" by the police. On March 3rd at 2pm, Bender was caught shoplifting."
3, 41, "Albert", "Yeah, show us the picture!  There he is!"
3, 41, "Bender", "OK, kids. It's 9.00, you know what that means. Daddy's sick of looking at you so go to bed.  The grown-ups have to talk. Come on, Ma."
3, 41, "Bender", "Now to figure out how much money I'm raking in off those twerps!  Oh! I need a calculator."
3, 41, "Fry", "You are a calculator."
3, 41, "Bender", "I mean a good calculator. Minus the food, the bunny rabbit wallpaper--  I'm getting 100 bucks a kid and they're costing me 110!"
3, 41, "Fry", "There goes my new kitchen cabinets."
3, 41, "Bender", "I'm not sitting through one more PTA meeting. The kids have got to go!"
3, 41, "Sam", "Daddy, how do I flush you?"
3, 41, "Bender", "Just go to bed!"
3, 41, "Adlai", "You know, doing this jigsaw puzzle of a pacifier factory makes me want to have children with you all the more."
3, 41, "Leela", "Adlai, I was thinking, since we're both orphans, maybe we should adopt a child."
3, 41, "Adlai", "Adoption? Yes, that's acceptable. Heck, it's more than acceptable, it's adequately satisfactory!"
3, 41, "Bender", "Hello? Imperial Dragon Restaurant? I've got a herd of you-know-whats for sale. Let me check.  Oh, aren't you a cutie?  About 35lbs.  What?"
3, 41, "Leela", "Hi, Bender. We'd like to adopt a child."
3, 41, "Bender", "Well, you've come to the right place because Honest Bender's Orphanarium means discount orphans. Now, little lady. What do I have to do to send you home with 12 orphans today?"
3, 41, "Adlai", "Uh, I'm afraid we only want one."
3, 41, "Bender", "Whatever you say, chief. I'll show you what I got in stock."
3, 41, "Leela", "I remember this from when we were kids"
3, 41, "Albert", "I'm Albert."
3, 41, "Leela", "Kind of fatty."
3, 41, "Bender", "Then how about this little number? Pure-bred human. No vampire in there."
3, 41, "Leela", "Uh, um."
3, 41, "Adlai", "Hmm."
3, 41, "Bender", "If you're strapped for cash, you might wanna consider this irregular unit.  Cursed with a third ear but so full of that emotion I understand is called ""love""."
3, 41, "Sally", "One time, I did a hundred jump ropes."
3, 41, "Leela", "Oh, I can't decide. We're gonna have to think about it."
3, 41, "Bender", "OK, kids, grown-ups gotta talk now, time for bed."
3, 41, "Albert", "But it's 10 in the morning!"
3, 41, "Bender", "I said hit the hay!"
3, 41, "Leela", "Oh, they're all so adorable."
3, 41, "Bender", "Yeah. You know, it's times like this I can hardly bear to let them go. Goodnight, you princes of Maine, you kings of New New England."
3, 41, "Smitty", "You're under arrest for child cruelty, child endangerment, depriving children of food, selling children as food and misrepresenting the weight of livestock."
3, 41, "Bender", "If you had kids of your own, you'd understand!"
3, 41, "Leela", "Officer, would it be alright if we adopted one of the kids?"
3, 41, "Smitty", "Might as well. They're just gonna rot in the evidence locker."
3, 41, "Orphan #1", "Nice ear!"
3, 41, "Orphan #2", "Hey, freaky ears!"
3, 41, "Orphan #3", "How's you hearing?"
3, 41, "Leela", "I've made up my mind. Let's adopt her."
3, 41, "Adlai", "Her? But there's plenty of normal ones."
3, 41, "Leela", "Come on, Adlai. She could really use a mom and dad."
3, 41, "Kids", "Ear-face! Ear-face! Sally won the ugly race!"
3, 41, "Adlai", "On the other hand, the children bring up a good point. She does have an ear on her face."
3, 41, "Leela", "Well? So what? She may be different but she still deserves a good home."
3, 41, "Adlai", "Oh, alright. If you really want that one, I can give her an operation to make her acceptable."
3, 41, "Leela", "She doesn't need an operation! She's fine the way she is!"
3, 41, "Adlai", "Oh, and I suppose you were fine the way you were?"
3, 41, "Leela", "Damn right I was!"
3, 41, "Fry", "Yay!"
3, 41, "Leela", "Shut up, Fry. Now look, Adlai. I'm proud to be different. And I just wished I'd realised that when I was her age."
3, 41, "Sally", "I also have a tail!"
3, 41, "Leela", "Now take me to the hospital and put my eye back the way it was. Right now!"
3, 41, "Adlai", "Why should I do that?"
3, 41, "Leela", "Listen, buddy. By the end of the day, one of us is gonna have one eye."
3, 41, "Vogel", "In recognition of Bender's generous gift of 12 orphans and a government cheque for 1200 wing-wangs, I hereby rename this building the Bender B. Rodriguez Orphanarium!"
3, 41, "Fry", "It's good to have the old weird-looking Leela back."
3, 41, "Leela", "Aww! You're a true friend, Fry. I guess there's nothing wrong with being a little weird."
3, 41, "Fry", "Leela, there's nothing wrong with anything."
3, 41, "Albert", "We'll miss you, Daddy Bender."
3, 41, "Nina", "We know robots don't have emotions but we drawed you this picture."
3, 41, "Sally", "So if you ever miss us, even just a teeny bit, you can look at it."
3, 41, "Bender", "Hey, I smoke a cigar, not a candy cane. Sheesh!  Hey! What the-- Get away! Come on! I just got all the gum off of there! Hey! Hey!  I hate you! I hate you all!"
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "Yes?"
3, 42, "Amy", "Hi, Dad. It's me and my co-workers."
3, 42, "Mrs. Wong", "Open up, Leo. It's Amy and her weirdos."
3, 42, "Mrs. Wong", "Howdy, friends! Welcome to Mars!"
3, 42, "Leela", "Thanks so much for inviting us, Mr. Wong. I've never been to a Mars Day barbecue."
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "Oh, Mars Day much better than Earth Day. Dump trash wherever you want! Big, empty planet!"
3, 42, "Mrs. Wong", "OK, then. Make yourselves at home."
3, 42, "Zoidberg", "Don't mind if I already did. By the way, do you have anymore of this Dom Perignon bubble bath? There was only enough to fill the tub halfway."
3, 42, "Farnsworth", "This is quite a large ranch you have."
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "17.9 billion acres. We own entire western hemisphere.  That the best hemisphere!"
3, 42, "Farnsworth", "It's the same on Earth."
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "Here is most number one product of all"
3, 42, "Zoidberg", "I broke your television."
3, 42, "Hermes", "Mon, it must take forever to brand all those cattle."
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "Not really. We own so much stuff it easier just to brand everything that not ours."
3, 42, "Hermes", "Please don't do that."
3, 42, "Amy", "Betsy!  This is my sweet, little Betsy. I raised her from a larva that ate one of my sweaters."
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "Yes, everybody love Betsy. We going to eat her at Amy's wedding. If she ever get married!"
3, 42, "Amy", "Dad! Gleesh! Please don't say things like that when you meet my boyfriend tonight."
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "Oh, that right. We finally get to spend some time with this Mr. Kif."
3, 42, "Mrs. Wong", "I just hope he's a nice man who can make us lot of grandchildren. This not some parallel universe where you getting any younger."
3, 42, "Zapp", "Now remember, Kif, the quickest way to a girl's bed is through her parents. Have sex with them and you're in."
3, 42, "Kif", "Actually, sir, I'm-I'm a little nervous about meeting her family."
3, 42, "Zapp", "Well that's natural. After all you're meek and uninteresting. Until now you've gotten by on my left-over charisma, scrounging off it like a tiny charisma parasite."
3, 42, "Kif", "I just hope they like me."
3, 42, "Zapp", "And why wouldn't they? Yes, yes, I know. Tiny, meek, uninteresting. Spare me your tedious life story, Kif. And above all have fun!"
3, 42, "Bender", "Yeah, yeah, get on down!  Oh, yeah! Drop another barnyard bomb on us, Vanilla Corn!"
3, 42, "DJ", "Yo, fool, it's Mixmaster Festus!"
3, 42, "Fry", "So what's Mars Day about, anyway?"
3, 42, "Mrs. Wong", "It commemorate the day centuries ago when our ancestor, Sir Reginald Wong, bought Mars from stupid natives."
3, 42, "Leela", "How can you call the Native Martians ""stupid""?"
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "They sell whole planet for one bead. Sound stupid to me!"
3, 42, "Farnsworth", "That is stupid!"
3, 42, "Leela", "I can't believe you're laughing at the tragic exploitation of a proud, bead-loving people."
3, 42, "Fry", "Lighten up, Leela. It's funny!"
3, 42, "Leela", "Of course it is. But you don't have to laugh!"
3, 42, "Kif", "Amy, no! Not on your parents' planet!"
3, 42, "RJ", "Howdy, Amy. Glad to see you've come back to the country. It's where the flavour is."
3, 42, "Amy", "RJ, this is my boyfriend, Kif."
3, 42, "RJ", "This wimp? You've gone a long way, baby.  Cigarette, partner?"
3, 42, "Kif", "Oh, I don't--"
3, 42, "RJ", "I haven't even lit it yet!"
3, 42, "Kif", "Oh. Is it lit now?"
3, 42, "RJ", "Yep.  You're pathetic!"
3, 42, "Zoidberg", "Host-man! Host-woman! I'm having a wonderful time!"
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "You here five hours and already you tear up couch, draw moustache on priceless painting and fill pool with brine shrimp."
3, 42, "Zoidberg", "Not bad for a city boy, huh?  By the way, I took the liberty of fertilising your caviar."
3, 42, "Amy", "Just relax. I'm sure my parents will love you."
3, 42, "Kif", "You don't understand. When I get nervous, I can't control my camouflage reflex.  Oh, dear!  Oh, goodness! Oh, odds and bodkins!"
3, 42, "Fry", "I'll have a thorax and some feelers."
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "You want some salad with that?"
3, 42, "Fry", "Yuck!"
3, 42, "Amy", "Mom? Dad? You remember Kif?"
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "This your boyfriend? I have instant dislike of him!"
3, 42, "Mrs. Wong", "He too scrawny to father grandchildren."
3, 42, "Amy", "He's not scrawny, he's just small-boned."
3, 42, "Kif", "Actually, I don't have bones. I'm supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders that--"
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "Yes, yes! You a big squishy wuss! Amy should be dating real man. Like him!"
3, 42, "Kif", "I can be manly too. I think I'll, uh, light up a smoke."
3, 42, "Amy", "Wrong way!"
3, 42, "Kif", "Smooth!"
3, 42, "Amy", "Look on the bright side"
3, 42, "Kif", "Oh, now they'll never think I'm manly enough to date their daughter."
3, 42, "Amy", "It's OK, Kif.  I'll go get you a tissue from your tote."
3, 42, "RJ", "Hey there, Amy. Like you to meet my buddy, Joe."
3, 42, "Joe", "Sorry I'm late. My pool game ran long at the jazz club!"
3, 42, "RJ", "Kids love him!"
3, 42, "Fry", "What's that weird sound?"
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "Dust storm! Oh, dust storm! Everybody into house. Hurry, before we die. And wipe your damn feet!"
3, 42, "Mrs. Wong", "Phew! Everyone OK? No one considering lawsuit?"
3, 42, "Farnsworth", "Hmm. I might have mental anguish."
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "I'll have you know I'm friends with every judge on planet."
3, 42, "Farnsworth", "I'm OK then."
3, 42, "Mrs. Wong", "Storm dying down. Leo, check if buggalo herd is OK."
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "Oh!"
3, 42, "Leela", "What happened to the buggalo?"
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "They been rustled under cover of storm. We ruined!"
3, 42, "Zoidberg", "Nooo!"
3, 42, "Amy", "Don't worry, Daddy. It'll be OK."
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "Oh, really? Who gonna save us?  One-eye?  Lobster mooch?  Drunken garbage can?"
3, 42, "Hermes", "This sounds like a job for--"
3, 42, "Kif", "Lieutenant Kif Kroker!"
3, 42, "Hermes", "Alright then."
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "Aye-ah! Those buggalo are what made Wong family so rich and powerful. Oh, Inez, with them stolen, we ruined!"
3, 42, "Mrs. Wong", "OK. I want a divorce."
3, 42, "Zoidberg", "Mom! Dad! Don't ask me to choose!"
3, 42, "Amy", "They're not your parents, I'm not your sister and that's not your golf cart."
3, 42, "Zoidberg", "Aw!"
3, 42, "Amy", "Everybody just calm down. Kif promised he'd catch the rustlers."
3, 42, "Kif", "Mrs. Wong, do you have a neckerchief I could borrow?"
3, 42, "Kif", "My plan is to take all the remaining buggalo and lead them on a rough, tough cattle drive. Then, when the rustlers attack, I'll make a citizen's arrest!"
3, 42, "Farnsworth", "It sounds dangerous. Someone could get killed. Fry, Leela, Bender, I want you to go with him."
3, 42, "Fry", "Aw, man!"
3, 42, "Kif", "Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Wong. I'll get your cattle back or die trying."
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "Hey, we can't lose!"
3, 42, "Amy", "No, Kif! It's too risky. You don't have to do this to prove your manliness."
3, 42, "Mrs. Wong", "Oh, yes he does!"
3, 42, "RJ", "Here are your mounts!"
3, 42, "Leela", "She's got a fine coat."
3, 42, "Kif", "Now, we need buggalo to lure the rustlers. How many are left?"
3, 42, "Amy", "You're lookin' at her. Betsy's the only one left. She was curled up in my hamper when the storm hit.  Aw, she likes you!"
3, 42, "Kif", "Saddle up, men. We got some no good rustlers to ... catch!"
3, 42, "Bender", ""
3, 42, "Fry", "Yee-haw!"
3, 42, "Leela", "Wow, look at that"
3, 42, "Fry", "Where?"
3, 42, "Leela", "Right in front of you."
3, 42, "Fry", "Oh. Oh!"
3, 42, "Kif", "We'll camp near the top. The rustlers will be sure to spot us there."
3, 42, "Fry", "Where?"
3, 42, "Bender", "And even though the computer was off and unplugged, an image stayed on the screen. It was ... the Windows logo!"
3, 42, "Fry", "Pft, that's not scary!"
3, 42, "Bender", "It is if you're a laser printer."
3, 42, "Leela", "OK, my turn to tell a ghost story. Once, there was this woman driving--"
3, 42, "Fry", "Hook on the hand!"
3, 42, "Kif", "OK, I've got one. This family--"
3, 42, "Fry", "Man in the attic!"
3, 42, "Leela", "Fine, Mr. Know-It-All-About-Something-Finally, you tell a story!"
3, 42, "Fry", "With pleasure.  Once, not far from here, four people set out on a cattle drive--"
3, 42, "Bender", "Robot gets bored and kills Fry with a hammer!  Sorry, go on."
3, 42, "Fry", "And then, while they sat helplessly around the campfire ... a demented knife-wielding escaped lunatic libertarian zombie mutant snuck up and--"
3, 42, "Amy", "Surprise!"
3, 42, "Kif", "Amy? What are you doing here?"
3, 42, "Amy", "I forgot to give you something before you left."
3, 42, "Kif", "What?"
3, 42, "Amy", "Is that your camouflage reflex or are you just happy to see me?"
3, 42, "Kif", "I love it out here, Amy. I feel so manly. I have a blister, I-I spit! A-And of course, I tell no one my feelings."
3, 42, "Amy", "But you still have them, right?"
3, 42, "Kif", "Oh, yes. But I keep them inside until I can write them in my diary."
3, 42, "Amy", "Ah, it's a wonderful night."
3, 42, "Kif", "It sure is. I could just lie here beside you staring at the sky all night."
3, 42, "Amy", "I can't!  What's that?"
3, 42, "Kif", "Maybe we just made love."
3, 42, "Amy", "The buggalo! They're in the crater."
3, 42, "Kif", "The rustlers must have seen me coming and run off, scared."
3, 42, "Amy", "Oh, Kif! You're so brave!"
3, 42, "Kif", "Sh! They'll hear us!"
3, 42, "Kif", "OK, the dynamite's in place."
3, 42, "Amy", "Are you sure there's no other way to get the buggalo out?"
3, 42, "Leela", "Not unless your parents have thousands of helicopters at their disposal."
3, 42, "Amy", "Well, actually--"
3, 42, "Bender", "Too late! This is more fun!"
3, 42, "Amy", "Kif! You did it! But how did you know the dynamite would work?"
3, 42, "Kif", "I once took a seminar in ejecting chickens from a sand dune. The principle is essentially the same."
3, 42, "Fry", "Hey, it's that ""barbecue's over"" sound again."
3, 42, "Leela", "Sandstorm!  We're in the eye of the storm!"
3, 42, "Fry", "Where?"
3, 42, "Bender", "What's that?"
3, 42, "Fry", "My God!"
3, 42, "Leela", "Who are they?"
3, 42, "Singing Wind", "Fehk! We are the Native Martians."
3, 42, "Fry", "Also, I didn't know buggalo could fly."
3, 42, "Singing Wind", "Only those who revere Mother Mars can fly buggalo. And only they shall have buggalo. And they're us."
3, 42, "Kif", "But your, um, Martian-ness, these buggalo aren't yours. They belong to the Wong family."
3, 42, "Singing Wind", "You mean family that took all Martian land and gave us one lousy bead?"
3, 42, "Amy", "Uh-huh! Amy Wong.  And you are?"
3, 42, "Singing Wind", "Mad at Wong family! We plan to ruin them by stealing buggalo. But now we take girl instead."
3, 42, "Amy", "Wait! I'm too rich to be kidnapped!"
3, 42, "Kif", "Amy! Nooo!"
3, 42, "Bender", "Don't worry, Kif. I'm sure some other beautiful, rich girl will fall in love with you."
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "Hooray! You bring back cattle."
3, 42, "Kif", "Yes ... but ... I'm afraid I've got some bad news as well."
3, 42, "Mrs. Wong", "Let Amy tell us. That way it soften the blow.  Why Amy being so quiet?"
3, 42, "Kif", "Um ... well, um ... that is, um..."
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "Oh, no! Martians kidnap Amy!  I know it them 'cause they no use good grammar."
3, 42, "Kif", "I'll get your daughter back, sir. I swear."
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "Forget it, squishy. You the one lose her in first place. You done enough."
3, 42, "Mrs. Wong", "Yeah. This time we get most decorated law man in the whole universe!"
3, 42, "Kif", "You mean-- Oh, no, please. I beg you! Oh, for the love of--"
3, 42, "Zapp", "I am the man with no name. Zapp Brannigan, at your service!"
3, 42, "Mrs. Wong", "Please, Mr. Brannigan, we need you go get our daughter back."
3, 42, "Zapp", "Very well. I'll clean up Kif's mess. I shall go bargain with the Martian's personally.  Your gasps intrigue me. Explain."
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "Martians have no land. They been gently encouraged to live on reservation deep underground. No one ever dare go there."
3, 42, "Farnsworth", "This mission is incredibly dangerous. Someone's sure to be killed. Fry, Leela, Bender--"
3, 42, "Bender", "Damn you, old man!"
3, 42, "Leela", "Aw, look. Betsy followed you, Kif!"
3, 42, "Zapp", "I didn't realise you were bringing your girlfriend, lieutenant!"
3, 42, "Kif", "She won't leave me alone."
3, 42, "Zapp", "Did I say ""girlfriend""? She sounds more like a wife!"
3, 42, "Zapp", "Behold"
3, 42, "Fry", "Hm."
3, 42, "Zapp", "The only known entrance to the Martian reservation."
3, 42, "Leela", "What about the Great Stone Ass of Mars?"
3, 42, "Zapp", "Well, yeah, but it's way over the other side of the planet."
3, 42, "Zapp", "Nose-ward, ho!"
3, 42, "Singing Wind", "Fehk! I am Singing Wind, chief of the Martian tribe."
3, 42, "Zapp", "Take me to your leader."
3, 42, "Singing Wind", "Moving along. Why you trespass on our land?"
3, 42, "Zapp", "We come to negotiate the release of Amy Wong. And just to clarify"
3, 42, "Leela", "They have such respect for the planet."
3, 42, "Martian #1", "Cynthia used to drink Slurm."
3, 42, "Singing Wind", "We will give back girl when we get back planet surface."
3, 42, "Zapp", "How do we even know she's alive?"
3, 42, "Amy", "I'm fine."
3, 42, "Zapp", "Sh! You're weakening our bargaining position. How about instead you give us the girl and we carve a bunch of our presidents into your sacred mountain?"
3, 42, "Singing Wind", "You waste words. We want return of land that was taken from us."
3, 42, "Bender", "Uh, actually you traded it for a bead."
3, 42, "Singing Wind", "Tribe suffer heap big buyer's remorse. We want land back!"
3, 42, "Zapp", "Chief, my people are a people of law. And that law is ...  ... no backsies!"
3, 42, "Singing Wind", "The time for stupid statements is over!"
3, 42, "Zapp", "Oh, boy!"
3, 42, "Leela", "Ow, ow, ow, ow! My eye!"
3, 42, "Zoidberg", "Ma! Pa! Our precious ranch!"
3, 42, "Kif", "Amy, no! It's too windy!  Stay calm, dearest! I'll save you!"
3, 42, "Amy", "Kif!  You're flying Betsy!"
3, 42, "Kif", "Need a lift?"
3, 42, "Singing Wind", "Great Mother Mars! He has the gift!"
3, 42, "Leela", "Yay, Kif!"
3, 42, "Zapp", "Kroker, that was one Brannigan-esque feat of heroism!"
3, 42, "Singing Wind", "We have misjudged you, green one. You fly the buggalo like us. You have true reverence for Mother Mars. Let there be peace between us."
3, 42, "Martian #2", "Yes. Let us smoke-em peace pipe."
3, 42, "Kif", "Smoke-em?"
3, 42, "Singing Wind", "Here, take."
3, 42, "Kif", "Ooh, no thanks. I'm on the peace patch."
3, 42, "Singing Wind", "You must smoke peace pipe, and you must do it peacefully. Or we'll kill you."
3, 42, "Kif", "Well, it's just really that I don't feel that--"
3, 42, "Zapp", "Don't be such a chicken, Kif. Teenagers all smoke and they seem pretty on-the-ball."
3, 42, "Fry", "Yeah!"
3, 42, "Zapp", "Yes, sir!"
3, 42, "Bender", "Way to suck it!"
3, 42, "Kif", "Hey, I'm smoking! I'm the greatest!  Oh, monkey trumpets!"
3, 42, "Singing Wind", "You have coughed at our offer of peace. So you must die!"
3, 42, "Martian #3", "The very bead used to crush our dreams shall be used to crush your bones."
3, 42, "Kif", "Well, actually, I don't have bones. I'm supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders that--"
3, 42, "Fry", "Wait. That's the bead you traded your land for?"
3, 42, "Leela", "It's a gigantic diamond! That thing must be worth a fortune."
3, 42, "Singing Wind", "Really?"
3, 42, "Bender", "Oh, Chief, you've made me the happiest girl in the world!"
3, 42, "Amy", "Y'know, if you still want your land, we could just trade back for it."
3, 42, "Singing Wind", "Hmm. We always thought bead was worthless. We assumed our ancestors were cheated because they not have concept of ownership."
3, 42, "Bender", "So we can have the diamond?"
3, 42, "Singing Wind", "No. We do have concept of ownership. You are free to go. Sorry about all the rustling and kidnapping."
3, 42, "Leela", "But what about your sacred land?"
3, 42, "Singing Wind", "Land shmand! We don't wanna live on this planet. It's a dump. We'll buy new planet and act like it's sacred. With cash like this, who's going to argue? Nobody, that's who!"
3, 42, "Amy", "Then Kif flew Betsy, rescued me from the tornado and made peace with the Martians."
3, 42, "Mr. Wong", "Please! He too much of a wimp."
3, 42, "Mrs. Wong", "Yeah. I'm sure it was all Mr. Zapp Brannigan here."
3, 42, "Zapp", "Please, you give me too little credit."
3, 42, "Zoidberg", "Captain Brannigan, you're always welcome here at Rancho Zoidberg!"
3, 42, "Zoidberg", "Money doesn't make good people, no, siree!"
3, 42, "Amy", "Thanks for saving my life, Kif. You're my hero."
3, 42, "Kif", "Oh, you're kind. But your parents still don't like me."
3, 42, "Amy", "Well globviously! But if they liked you then I wouldn't. Don't you know anything about girls?"
3, 42, "Kif", "Dear diary, I just made love for the second time!"
3, 43, "Announcer", "Futurama is brought to you by ...  ... Thompson's Teeth"
3, 43, "Farnsworth", "Good news, everyone! Today marks our dear friend Dr. Zoidberg's 10th year with Planet Express. Huzzahs are in order."
3, 43, "Fry", "Huzzah!"
3, 43, "Leela", "Huzzah!"
3, 43, "Amy", "Huzzah!"
3, 43, "Zoidberg", "Hooray for me! Hooray for Zoidberg!"
3, 43, "Hermes", "I will now read the mandatory speech.   Dear employee. Has it really been five, 10 or 15 years? If not, please disregard this and get back to work. Distribute token of appreciation and applaud."
3, 43, "Zoidberg", "Look! Coupons! I can get two oil changes for the price of one! Now if I could only afford the one ... and the car. Ah, the years! So many memories, so many strange fluids gushing out of patients' bodies--"
3, 43, "Hermes", "Yes, yes. Now here's your pension statement.  It's empty because you haven't paid into it, you dumb stinkbug!"
3, 43, "Zoidberg", "You kept track of it all these years!"
3, 43, "Fry", "Oh, no, I'm boned! I haven't paid into the pension either. What'll I do when I retire?"
3, 43, "Bender", "I thought you were retired."
3, 43, "Fry", "Hey, I don't see you planning for your old age."
3, 43, "Bender", "I got plans. I'm gonna turn my on/off switch to ""off""."
3, 43, "Fry", "Well I'm gonna take action. It's time to check on my retirement fund.  Damn! Still only $100."
3, 43, "Franklin", "A penny saved is a penny earned. Also, could you get some athlete's foot cream for my face?"
3, 43, "Fry", "He's right! I've gotta start investing wisely."
3, 43, "Fry", "Well, I'm down to my last lottery ticket.  Cherry.  Cherry!  Mule. Crud!"
3, 43, "Bender", "So, you got six bucks left to retire on. I recommend Tender Vittles."
3, 43, "Teller", "You're opening a retirement account for $6? I'm sure a wealthy ...  ... mule farmer like yourself is aware that we charge a $10 monthly fee."
3, 43, "Fry", "You gotta spend money to make money."
3, 43, "Teller", "Here you are, sir. Your account is now overdrawn by $4."
3, 43, "Robot", "Gee, I've seen lines move faster in a sperm bank."
3, 43, "Bender", "That's for sure--  Roberto! Is that you?"
3, 43, "Roberto", "Bender! Hey, man!"
3, 43, "Bender", "You old lunatic! How you been?"
3, 43, "Roberto", "Not bad, not bad.  Everybody on the floor! This is a stick-up!"
3, 43, "Bender", "Yeah, I'm doing OK too.  I'm taking a Chinese cooking class at the Learning Annex."
3, 43, "Roberto", "Cool. Ca-Can you give me a hand here?"
3, 43, "Bender", "Sure thing, pal."
3, 43, "Roberto", "Hey, you! Red!  Quit watering that plant and get the door!"
3, 43, "Bender", "Well, nice talking to you."
3, 43, "Roberto", "Same here.  You guys are alright! Here's something for your trouble."
3, 43, "Bender", "Hey, thanks, buddy!"
3, 43, "Smitty", "Freeze, punks! You're under arrest!"
3, 43, "Nixon", "Shoot them in the back! Quick! While they're not looking!"
3, 43, "Bailiff", "Court is in session. The Honourable Judge Whitey presiding."
3, 43, "Whitey", "The charge is bank robbery. Now, my caddie chauffeur informs me that a bank is a place where people put money that isn't properly invested. Therefore, robbing a bank is tantamount to that most heinous of crimes, theft of money."
3, 43, "Hyper-Chicken", "As the surveillance camera for the bank what all the judge was a-jawing about, could y'all tell us what you done seen the day of the crime?"
3, 43, "Camera", "Well, let's see. My memory's a little fuzzy, but it went exactly like this"
3, 43, "Hyper-Chicken", "Your Honour, I move that I be disbarred for introducing this evidence against my own clients."
3, 43, "Hyper-Chicken", "Mr. Fry, do you recognise the robot a-huggin' on you in this here hologram?"
3, 43, "Fry", "I sure do! That's the real robber and I'll never forget his name as long as I live. And that name is--"
3, 43, "Leela", "Fry! Just give a name. You don't wanna look stupid on Court TV!"
3, 43, "Fry", "You're right. You're right. It was--"
3, 43, "Whitey", "Yes? What? You say if I testify I'll be killed? Oh. It's for you."
3, 43, "Roberto", "...and the other hamburger will..."
3, 43, "Roberto", "...also be made of your lungs. So long, pal."
3, 43, "Fry", "I refuse to testify on the grounds that my organs will be chopped up into a patty."
3, 43, "Whitey", "Ah, the 67th Amendment."
3, 43, "Hyper-Chicken", "I may be a simple country Hyper-Chicken but I know when we're finger-licked. Whattya say we plead insanity?"
3, 43, "Bender", "A few months in an insane asylum? I could do that standing on my head."
3, 43, "Hyper-Chicken", "If you start now, it might help our case."
3, 43, "Whitey", "Counselor, what evidence do you offer to support this new plea of insanity?"
3, 43, "Hyper-Chicken", "Well, for one, they done hired me to represent them."
3, 43, "Whitey", "Insanity plea is accepted. Mr. Bender, I hereby commit you to the asylum for criminally insane robots until such time as you are deemed cured."
3, 43, "Bender", "Yahoo! The system fails again!"
3, 43, "Whitey", "And, Mr. Fry, I sentence you to the home for criminally insane humans."
3, 43, "Bailiff", "Your Honour, that facility has been full ever since you ruled that being poor is a mental illness."
3, 43, "Whitey", "Order! Order! The only poor people I want to hear about are the people who tend to my pores at the spa. Just send them both to the robot loony bin and let's go."
3, 43, "Fry", "Ow! My head! Ow! My feet! Ow! My head! Ow! My feet!"
3, 43, "Farnsworth", "Keep your chin up!"
3, 43, "Fry", "Ow! My chin!"
3, 43, "Fry", "I don't belong here, Bender. This is an asylum for insane robots!"
3, 43, "Bender", "Well, you meet half the qualifications."
3, 43, "Fry", "Oh, good, a physical! Once they examine my fragile, naked, pink body, they'll see I'm not a--"
3, 43, "Fry", "What the--"
3, 43, "Bender", "I find that offensive!"
3, 43, "Dr. Perceptron", "Greetings. I am Dr. Perceptron. Let me give you something to help you relax."
3, 43, "Fry", "Look! There's been a terrible mistake. I'm a human being. See?  I'm all squishy and flabby. Also, I complain a lot."
3, 43, "Dr. Perceptron", "Yes, you do. You need to relax more.  Terrific. Now, consider the following"
3, 43, "Fry", "I do other human stuff! I age! See?"
3, 43, "Nurse Ratchet", "I'm Nurse Ratchet. Please come with me, won't you?"
3, 43, "Nurse Ratchet", "We'll meet your roommate next, shall we? His name is Malfunctioning Eddie."
3, 43, "Fry", "The car dealer? Wow! I guess his prices really were insane."
3, 43, "Nurse Ratchet", "He's very excitable.  So don't say anything to surprise him."
3, 43, "Malfunctioning Eddie", "Pleased to meet you."
3, 43, "Fry", "Actually, we've met once before."
3, 43, "Malfunctioning Eddie", "What?"
3, 43, "Hairbot", "I'm a pretty girl. I'm a pretty girl. I'm a pretty girl."
3, 43, "Bender", "Whoa! Someone had a busy day."
3, 43, "Fry", "My roommate exploded. Oh, you gotta help me, Bender. How can I prove I'm human?"
3, 43, "Bender", "You could drop dead. That'd show 'em."
3, 43, "Fry", "I don't wanna!"
3, 43, "Unit 2013", "Hey, man. I believe you're a human."
3, 43, "Fry", "You do?"
3, 43, "Unit 2013", "Sure. They don't believe I'm a human either. Name's Unit 2013. C'mon. Lemme introduce you around.  Fry, meet Norm. How's it going, pal? Still picking up transmissions from the CIA on your teeth?"
3, 43, "Norm", "They just won't stop!"
3, 43, "Woman", "The CIA cafeteria menu for the week of May 15th is as follows"
3, 43, "Unit 2013", "Cuckoo!"
3, 43, "Fry", "Let me guess, he thinks he's Lincoln?"
3, 43, "Unit 2013", "Well, he's supposed to. Problem is he's got multiple personalities -- all of them Lincoln."
3, 43, "Lincolnbot", "I was born in 200 log cabins."
3, 43, "Unit 2013", "And this here is Frankie. He's convinced he's a lunchroom worker, so they put him to work in the lunchroom.  How is work in the lunchroom, Frankie?"
3, 43, "Frankie", "It's alright."
3, 43, "Unit 2013", "Poor Frankie!"
3, 43, "Mad Hatterbot", "Change places!"
3, 43, "Fry", "Bender, I can't take much more of this! I want outta here!"
3, 43, "Bender", "Are you crazy? This place is great! Electroshock whenever you want it, two Lincolns for every Napoleon.  Ah! Sweet light crude!"
3, 43, "Fry", "But I'm not a robot like you. I don't like having discs crammed into me. Unless they're Oreos -- and then only in the mouth! Don't you understand? I'm gonna die here!"
3, 43, "Bender", "Ah, quit your bellyaching and take it like a robot."
3, 43, "Mad Hatterbot", "Change places!"
3, 43, "Victor", "The doctor says you are making great strides with your exploding problem."
3, 43, "Malfunctioning Eddie", "Well, the way I see it--"
3, 43, "Fry", "You gotta get me out of here. I would have starved to death if not for that sick vending machine robot.  Gimme! Gimme!"
3, 43, "Hermes", "Poor Fry! He's got the munchies for freedom!"
3, 43, "Leela", "We're all trying to help you. We've petitioned the governor but he doesn't want to appear soft on people who've been falsely imprisoned."
3, 43, "Fry", "At least I have friends on the outside. Bender's been no help at all."
3, 43, "Bender", "Je suis Napoleon!  No, seriously, I'm not."
3, 43, "Amy", "Bender! You should be more ashamed of yourself than usual."
3, 43, "Bender", "Ah, lighten up, honey. I'm just trying to get through a difficult time using humour."
3, 43, "Nurse Ratchet", "Visiting hours are over. Time for our medication disks."
3, 43, "Fry", "Help me! For God's sake, help me!"
3, 43, "Farnsworth", "Oh, don't worry, Fry. I too once spent a nightmare-ish time in a robot asylum. But now it's nearly over. So long."
3, 43, "Fry", "Thirty days hath September, April, June and ... wonder ... is that peanut butter ... what am I gonna do?   Oh, God! What? What? What is it now?"
3, 43, "Dr. Perceptron", "You are being released."
3, 43, "Fry", "Finally! Sweet justice! Sweet, juicy justice!"
3, 43, "Dr. Perceptron", "Not you. Him."
3, 43, "Malfunctioning Eddie", "Me? What a surprise.  Look!"
3, 43, "Malfunctioning Eddie", "I barely exploded at all."
3, 43, "Dr. Perceptron", "We can control that with medication."
3, 43, "Nurse Ratchet", "Fry? Are we ready to meet our new roommate?"
3, 43, "Roberto", "Hi, Red!"
3, 43, "Fry", "Roberto! W-W-W-What are you doing here?"
3, 43, "Roberto", "I got busted robbing that bank again."
3, 43, "Fry", "Why would you hold up the same bank twice?"
3, 43, "Roberto", "Ah, that first time was just to case the joint and rob it a little.  What's the matter? You scared?"
3, 43, "Fry", "N-- N-- N--"
3, 43, "Roberto", "Noticeably? I'll say! Now stand back, I gotta practise my stabbing."
3, 43, "Fry", "No! Please! Help! Stop it! Please!"
3, 43, "Bender", "Hey! Keep it down in there! I'm tuning my banjo!"
3, 43, "Roberto", "Jeez, Red. Quit cowering. You call yourself a robot?"
3, 43, "Fry", "I'm not a robot!  I'm not a robot!"
3, 43, "Dr. Perceptron", "In answer to your question, Hermes, yes, your friend is cured."
3, 43, "Hermes", "Oh!"
3, 43, "Farnsworth", "What a relief!"
3, 43, "Leela", "Thank God!"
3, 43, "Dr. Perceptron", "You'll notice he no longer suffers delusions of humanity."
3, 43, "Fry", "Affirmative. I feel nothing. I am a robot. Beep, beep, beep ..."
3, 43, "Leela", "You've made a terrible mistake. He's a human being, not a machine. Oh, Fry!"
3, 43, "Bender", "Gonna sing a little tale about a battle called Waterloo.  Bonjour, y'all!"
3, 43, "Zoidberg", "Listen to me, Fry. Just because you think you're a robot, doesn't make you a robot. After all, I think I'm a doctor but that doesn't make me a doctor. These fancy clothes do!"
3, 43, "Fry", "Negative. I must be a robot. Why else would human women refuse to date me?"
3, 43, "Leela", "Oh, lots of reasons."
3, 43, "Fry", "Bio-units, terminate noise exchange. It is time for you to ingest sandwiches from my compartment."
3, 43, "Bender", "Here we go. Just a minute. Aha!"
3, 43, "Commentator", "And down the stretch, it's Daddy's Little Grandpa, followed by Perennial Loser, and bringing up the rear, it's Lasty!"
3, 43, "Bender", "Come on, Lasty!"
3, 43, "Roberto", "Hey, Bender."
3, 43, "Bender", "Roberto! Ooh, what a surprise to see you in here! Especially 'cause I didn't squeal on you, remember? Remember all that squealing I didn't do? Remember? Do you?"
3, 43, "Roberto", "Yeah, yeah. Now lie down and play dead. And don't ham it up!"
3, 43, "Bender", "Uh, sure.  Anything for you, buddy."
3, 43, "Roberto", "Wait here, Bender. I need to get a disguise."
3, 43, "Bender", "Uh, what's with the get-up?"
3, 43, "Roberto", "I'm in disguise 'cause I'm thinking of escaping. You in? Or do I gotta kill you so you don't squeal?"
3, 43, "Bender", "I'm in! I'm in!  So when were you planning the breakout?"
3, 43, "Roberto", "I'm thinking maybe a few seconds ago."
3, 43, "Bender", "Quick! Let's keep escaping!"
3, 43, "Hermes", "Times two, carry the one..."
3, 43, "Fry", "Oh, you sad, worthless human."
3, 43, "Hermes", "What are ya-- Sacred hog of Prague! That was my anniversary gift to LaBarbara!"
3, 43, "Fry", "Fear not! For I shall assist ye!"
3, 43, "Hermes", "Robots don't say ""ye""!"
3, 43, "Fry", "Relax, mammal. My robotic software shall meet your calculatory needs.  What is the meaning of this symbol?"
3, 43, "Hermes", "That's a plus sign, you pointy-haired loony! Quit thinking you're a robot!"
3, 43, "Fry", "I'll show ye!"
3, 43, "Fry", "Stand back. I'm a tool-bot."
3, 43, "Leela", "You're not a tool-bot. You're not a food-motron. You're not a robot of any kind."
3, 43, "Fry", "Yes, I am. I simply haven't discovered my primary function yet."
3, 43, "Leela", "OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can."
3, 43, "Farnsworth", "You're going to do his laundry?"
3, 43, "Leela", "Fry, this is for you."
3, 43, "Fry", "Beep."
3, 43, "Leela", "Oh, for God's sake!"
3, 43, "Zoidberg", "By a scallop's forelocks! What's with all the beer, Fry?"
3, 43, "Fry", "Alcohol fuels my power cells.  And as a mighty robot, I--  Beep."
3, 43, "Roberto", "Thanks for helping me escape, Bender."
3, 43, "Bender", "Oh, it was nothing."
3, 43, "Roberto", "It was not nothing!  I wanna repay you. Let me get you something in here."
3, 43, "Roberto", "Hands up! This is a stick-up again!"
3, 43, "Bender", "Wow! Hitting the same place three times? I admire your style, Roberto."
3, 43, "Roberto", "Gimme the remaining dough. And the calendars ... and that pen. Try to tear it so most of the beads are on my end!"
3, 43, "URL", "Police! You're busted!"
3, 43, "Smitty", "And don't try anything. This glass here is laser-proof.  Fire lasers!  Duck! Lasers!"
3, 43, "Bender", "Come on! I got a place where I like to hide after crimes."
3, 43, "Amy", "Aw! He looks like a little insane drunken angel."
3, 43, "Bender", "Hey, everybody. Meet my good pal, Roberto."
3, 43, "Hermes", "Hey, mon."
3, 43, "Roberto", "Nice to meet you."
3, 43, "Smitty", "Come out with your hands up."
3, 43, "Roberto", "Hostages!"
3, 43, "Roberto", "Back off! I got hostages!"
3, 43, "Zoidberg", "Hooray! I'm helping!"
3, 43, "Smitty", "Do you have any better hostages?"
3, 43, "Roberto", "To show them who's crazy, I'm gonna execute some of you. How 'bout you?"
3, 43, "Farnsworth", "Ouch! That's going to bleed when my heart beats."
3, 43, "Leela", "Wait! Take me first!"
3, 43, "Bender", "Yes! Take her first."
3, 43, "Roberto", "Shut up! Stop telling me how to do this!"
3, 43, "Zoidberg", "Oh, the fear!"
3, 43, "Roberto", "I'm thinking of a number between one and ten. Guess it and you die first. Go!"
3, 43, "Bender", "Um ... OK. Fifty ... six ... ish?"
3, 43, "Roberto", "56? 56? Oh, man! Now that's all I can think about! I'm gonna kill you, you ... no good ... 56-ing--"
3, 43, "Bender", "Don't kill me yet! I'm starting to come down with Stockholm Syndrome ... handsome!"
3, 43, "Fry", "Halt, fellow robot!"
3, 43, "Roberto", "Hey, Red. You're just in time to join the hostage situation. Which side you wanna be on?"
3, 43, "Fry", "The side that kicks your twisted, metal ass!"
3, 43, "Leela", "Fry! Stay back. He's too powerful."
3, 43, "Fry", "Negative, bossy meat creature. I know now what my primary function is"
3, 43, "Roberto", "I'm not crazy! Don't call me crazy! I'm just not user-friendly!"
3, 43, "Hermes", "Fry! Don't be a hero! It's not covered by the health plan!"
3, 43, "Roberto", "Let's see how much of a robot you really are!"
3, 43, "Fry", "No knife can penetrate my skin-tanium armour."
3, 43, "Roberto", "Help! Help! He is a battle-droid! Somebody help me! Mommy! I'm sorry I spilled the transmission fluid, Mommy! No! No! Don't weld me to the wall, Mommy!"
3, 43, "Smitty", "We're willing to listen to your demands."
3, 43, "URL", "Hey, baby. Wash that off before you put it back."
3, 43, "Hermes", "Who's brave now?"
3, 43, "Amy", "Hooray!"
3, 43, "Zoidberg", "Bravo!"
3, 43, "Leela", "You did it, Fry."
3, 43, "Bender", "Congratulations, buddy. You're a credit to my race."
3, 43, "Fry", "It was nothing. I--   Blood? Robots don't have blood. I must be a, a--"
3, 43, "Zoidberg", "A squid?"
3, 43, "Fry", "A human! Oh, my God! I'm a human!"
3, 43, "Zoidberg", "Also good."
3, 43, "Leela", "Thanks for saving us, Fry."
3, 43, "Fry", "I'm gonna continue never washing this cheek again."
3, 43, "Bender", "Buddy, you may be wrapped in greasy skin, but inside, you've got the heart of a robot."
3, 43, "Fry", "Aw. Thanks, Bender."
3, 43, "Bender", "Just like inside me, I've got the heart of a human.  What?"
3, 43, "Bender", "What?"
3, 44, "Bender", "Ah, beer! So many choices, and it makes so little difference."
3, 44, "Fry", "How 'bout Löbrau? It has dots on it."
3, 44, "Bender", "Overruled. The choice of champions is Pabst Blue Robot!"
3, 44, "Fry", "I can't drink that! The metal shavings make my throat bloody."
3, 44, "Bender", "Baby wants a Zima!"
3, 44, "Leela", "Hey, hey! We can all fight when we're drunk. Now, listen, why don't we just brew our own beer?"
3, 44, "Bender", "You can brew your own beer?"
3, 44, "Leela", "Sure. The kids at the orphanarium used to do it all the time."
3, 44, "Hermes", "Cursed bacteria of Liberia. My own son, suspended from boarding school."
3, 44, "Dwight", "It's not my fault, Dad."
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "And you, Cubert! I cloned you from one of my warts and I can send you straight back in there."
3, 44, "Cubert", "Nuh-uh!"
3, 44, "Zoidberg", "What's going on? Is this angry yelling or busted-hearing-aid yelling?"
3, 44, "Hermes", "I'm afraid it's both."
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "What?"
3, 44, "LaBarbara", "Now hold on. Everyone, cool your daiquiris! Let's give the little vermin a chance to explain themselves."
3, 44, "Dwight", "It was self defence, Mom. Just look at this letter the principal sent.  We were in science class and we had just finished building a miniature black hole."
3, 44, "Cubert", "That was easy."
3, 44, "Bret", "Pretty scrawny black hole. It must be hungry."
3, 44, "Cubert", "Duh! Black holes don't need food."
3, 44, "Bret", "Neither do nerds!"
3, 44, "Dwight", "My Manwich!"
3, 44, "Cubert", "That's it, Bret. You've compressed our lunches to a singularity for the last time! Salt him, Dwight!"
3, 44, "Bret", "When I re-solidify, I'm gonna put you in a world of goop!"
3, 44, "Cubert", "See? That bully started it. We couldn't fight back with brawn so we used our brains!"
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "I've warned you not to use those things!"
3, 44, "Leela", "Let's see. We've got our malt, our hops. We just need a big disposable tub to mix it in."
3, 44, "Bender", "Yo!"
3, 44, "Leela", "Now it needs to boil for a couple hours."
3, 44, "Hermes", "Dwight, you remember the crew."
3, 44, "Dwight", "Eh."
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Crew, you remember Cubert?  Wonderful! Then I'm sure you won't mind being their legal guardians for a month!"
3, 44, "Cubert", "Well, well.  If it isn't my old friend, stretch pants ...  ... no pants and ...  ... idiot!"
3, 44, "Bender", "We're making beer. I'm the brewery."
3, 44, "Dwight", "I heard alcohol makes you stupid."
3, 44, "Fry", "No I'm ... doesn't."
3, 44, "Leela", "Actually, Dwight, you're right. Alcohol is very, very bad ... for children. But once you turn 21 it becomes very, very good. So scram!"
3, 44, "Dwight", "Aw, man!"
3, 44, "Cubert", "I'm sick of this."
3, 44, "Cubert", "Hey, Dad. What useless contraption are you half-baking today?"
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Eh, wha? Oh! This is my latest invention; a device that lets anyone sound exactly like me!"
3, 44, "Cubert", "Good news, everyone! I'm a horse's butt!"
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "I am? That's not good news at all, you little--"
3, 44, "Dwight", "What's this devices marketability? Who's the target consumer?"
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "There is no target consumer! Only targets. Targets that will tremble in fear as their new master hands down edicts in my glorious, booming voice!  Now quit pestering me, you scoundrels!"
3, 44, "Hermes", "Stamp it, file it. Oh, yeah! Send it overnight!"
3, 44, "Dwight", "Can I collate that?"
3, 44, "Hermes", "No!"
3, 44, "Cubert", "Can I shred these contracts?"
3, 44, "Hermes", "No!"
3, 44, "Dwight", "Wow! A power-stamper!"
3, 44, "Hermes", "Now look at all the work I gotta do!  Ow!"
3, 44, "Leela", "Mmm. The ingredients are cooked. And they've picked up some of your natural robot flavourings. Time to add the yeast."
3, 44, "Bender", "Yeast? You mean I'll have a lifeform growing inside me?  It's so beautiful."
3, 44, "Leela", "Talk to me."
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "This is Professor Farnsworth. I have an important delivery for you and your dumb crew. You must deliver a pizza to Dogdoo 8, a planet at the edge of the universe."
3, 44, "Cubert", "Sorry I can't come down to say goodbye, but I'm busy inventing useless junk."
3, 44, "Dwight", "And I smell bad."
3, 44, "Cubert", "Hey!"
3, 44, "Leela", "If you were my kids, you'd get quite a talking to ... from your father ... when he got home from the Senate."
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Oh, bother! What have they done now?"
3, 44, "Bender", "Those pork dumplings sent us on a fake pizza delivery."
3, 44, "Fry", "The address was on Dogdoo 8 but the universe ends right after Dogdoo 7."
3, 44, "Hermes", "Child man, is this true?"
3, 44, "Dwight", "Yeah, but why are you mad at us? Your dummy brigade wasted a week on an obviously fake mission."
3, 44, "Cubert", "Plus, they're making bootleg beer inside company property!"
3, 44, "Bender", "Lies! Lies and slander!"
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Accusing gentle Bender of a misdeed? That's the last straw! You boys have been underfoot long enough!"
3, 44, "Hermes", "You jerked the words right outta my mouth. We're their fathers and it's high times we acted like it."
3, 44, "Bender", "Ooh-hoo! Here comes violence!"
3, 44, "Hermes", "Get a job, you lazy kids!"
3, 44, "Bender", "I guess if you want children beaten ...  ... you have to do it yourself."
3, 44, "Cubert", "Come on, Dad, shuffle faster!"
3, 44, "Dwight", "You don't wanna miss the unveiling of our new company, do you?"
3, 44, "Hermes", "Company?  How cute! What will you be pedalling? Lemonade? Shoe shines? Cootie insurance?"
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Perhaps they've constructed a teddy bear hospital!"
3, 44, "Cubert", "Actually, we're starting a competing delivery company."
3, 44, "Hermes", "Welcome to the world of business!"
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Who's going to use a delivery service with a kicked sign? Nobody, that's who!"
3, 44, "Dwight", "But we already have a client signed up. We're delivering the Daily Supernova."
3, 44, "Hermes", "So your delivery company is just a cute, harmless paper route?"
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Phew!"
3, 44, "Dwight", "No! It's a serious business."
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Yes it's a tremendous responsibility, alright!  What if a paper were to land in a puddle?"
3, 44, "Hermes", "Civilisation as we know it might get splashed!"
3, 44, "Dwight", "Why do they always treat us like dumb kids? We're practically old enough to find the Fox Network infantile!"
3, 44, "Cubert", "We'll show 'em. All Awesome Express needs is a sturdy interstellar delivery craft.  Voilà! You got a quarter?"
3, 44, "Dwight", "Man, the ad said to allow four to six seconds for delivery."
3, 44, "Cubert", "More like seven!"
3, 44, "Bender", "I'm really starting to swell up with beer. I must look ridiculous."
3, 44, "Fry", "No, you have a healthy glow."
3, 44, "Bender", "Oh, my God! I just felt it ferment!"
3, 44, "Leela", "Ooh! Let me feel.  Have you thought about what to name it?"
3, 44, "Bender", "I was thinking ""Benderbrau"" if it's an ale, ""Botweiser"" if it's a lager."
3, 44, "Fry", "I hope it's a lager so I can take it to a ball game.  Ooh, I felt that one!"
3, 44, "Cubert", "Uh, there's a crack in the hull here. That could cause explosive decompression."
3, 44, "Dwight", "Put a sticker on it."
3, 44, "Hermes", "Off on your first delivery, eh? You be careful, my little tinkler.  Remember we used to call you that, huh? Tinkler?"
3, 44, "Sal", "Gets movin'! Those newspapers won'ts deliver themselveses! Only the Sunday edition can dos that."
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Goodness, there must be 50 papers in that bundle! That's a big number, 50."
3, 44, "Cubert", "Yeah, if you're an idiot!"
3, 44, "Dwight", "Three, two, one."
3, 44, "Cubert", "All systems go."
3, 44, "Dwight", "Blast-off!"
3, 44, "Hermes", "See you at din-din!"
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "I'm blowing you a kiss."
3, 44, "Cubert", "Take evasive action!"
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "It's closing in! You can't avoid it! It's a cheek-seeker. And ... gotcha!"
3, 44, "Cubert", "Nooo!"
3, 44, "Hermes", "Business is down, so I filed papers to have you all reclassified as slaves."
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Well, well. If it isn't our little munchkin moguls!"
3, 44, "Hermes", "What's the trouble, men? Need some penny rolls for your profits?"
3, 44, "Cubert", "Actually, thanks to Dwight's brilliant accounting and my unaccountable brilliance ...  ... our paper route now has over a million customers!"
3, 44, "Dwight", "We're finally making more money than you guys! Aren't you impressed now, Pops? Aren'tcha? Aren'tcha?"
3, 44, "Hermes", "Uh, in a small way, yes. But you still don't have your own building or conference table or ... or one of those things!"
3, 44, "Zoidberg", "Hello!"
3, 44, "Dwight", "Our dads are never impressed, no matter what we do."
3, 44, "Cubert", "Maybe we should start a fire."
3, 44, "Dwight", "If we really wanna impress them we'll have to crush them with strategy ... Dwight Lightning!"
3, 44, "Cubert", "Very well. But I get to name the next strategy."
3, 44, "Announcer", "This week on The Real World"
3, 44, "Man", "I'm burning to death!"
3, 44, "Leela", "You know how much an apartment that big would cost on the Sun?"
3, 44, "Hermes", "People, as you know, our young sons have become great successes in the very same field as us."
3, 44, "Bender", "Alright!"
3, 44, "Fry", "That's great!"
3, 44, "Leela", "That's good!"
3, 44, "Hermes", "Naturally, we're humiliated."
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "That's why we need you, our loyal crew, to make Planet Express 800% more profitable."
3, 44, "Hermes", "We'll start by slashing salaries, and this time I mean really slashing."
3, 44, "Leela", "Uh, guys, I don't know how to tell you this, so I'll just let Fry blurt it out thoughtlessly."
3, 44, "Fry", "We don't work for you anymore!"
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "What?"
3, 44, "Leela", "Dwight and Cubert made us a better offer. We're paperboys now."
3, 44, "Cubert", "Incoming! We got papers to stuff, team! Hup two, hup two!"
3, 44, "Fry", "Yes, sir."
3, 44, "Bender", "Right away!"
3, 44, "Leela", "We're on it, Mr. Farnsworth."
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Folks, the situation is grim but we shall prevail, thanks to you, our crack team of loyal dregs!"
3, 44, "Hermes", "I don't even know who this guy is!"
3, 44, "Scruffy", "I'm Scruffy, the janitor."
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Yes, of course you are. Now we've got to buckle down and save Planet Express."
3, 44, "Scruffy", "I'm on break."
3, 44, "Cubert", "Sorry to interrupt this whirlwind of activity but we have an announcement."
3, 44, "Dwight", "I direct your attention to these forms, which I'm presently engaged in handing to you."
3, 44, "Hermes", "Sweet guinea pig of Winnipeg! They've taken over our company!"
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Balderdash! I never agreed to that!"
3, 44, "Dwight", "No. But you did declare yourself dead three years ago as a tax dodge."
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Tax dodge, nothing! You take one nap in a ditch at the park and they start declaring you this and that."
3, 44, "Cubert", "Either way, I technically inherit your building and your spaceship, which means Planet Express is now ...  ... Awesome Express!"
3, 44, "Hermes", "You rotten kids!  Will you be hiring?"
3, 44, "Dwight", "No."
3, 44, "Hermes", "You rotten kids!"
3, 44, "Fry", "There. One million papers, folded and loaded!"
3, 44, "Cubert", "Hey, Leela, help me apply these flame decals I got in my cereal. They'll make the ship go faster."
3, 44, "Leela", "And what's your scientific basis for thinking that?"
3, 44, "Cubert", "I'm 12."
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Oh, did I ever tell you how I used to own that ship?"
3, 44, "Zoidberg", "There but for the grace of God."
3, 44, "Bender", "Hush, little brewski,Don't you leak,Daddy wants to drink for at least a week. (talking) Oh, my God! I think it's time!"
3, 44, "Fry", "Hurry, Leela! Get some coasters and cold mugs."
3, 44, "Fry", "Push, Bender, push!"
3, 44, "Leela", "You're doing great!"
3, 44, "Bender", "It feels like I'm trying to push a water bed outta me."
3, 44, "Fry", "Almost there. Just two more bottles."
3, 44, "Bender", "Is it OK? I can't hear anything."
3, 44, "Fry", "It's an ale! Five gallons, six ounces!"
3, 44, "Dwight", "Hey, what's goin' on? This is a delivery company not a delivery room!"
3, 44, "Cubert", "We just busted our bums delivering a million papers and this is how you greet us, with a bunch of frosty, cold beers?"
3, 44, "Fry", "Hey, wait a second. How did you deliver a million papers in one hour?"
3, 44, "Cubert", "Uh ... we just did, OK? 'Cause we're awesome! Yeah! Awesome."
3, 44, "Dwight", "Yeah, awesome!"
3, 44, "Leela", "Hello, Awesome Express; the rude, crude delivery dudes. How may I direct your call? What's that? You haven't gotten your paper? In how long?"
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Uh, might a homeless old man have a touch more beef bourguignon? And another tequila slammer?  Please?"
3, 44, "LaBarbara", "Don't you sweet talk me, you wrinkly, old tube sack!"
3, 44, "Hermes", "Might I have one too, wife?"
3, 44, "LaBarbara", "Oh, you're both pathetic, being jealous of your own offspring. Now you should be happy they became successes, instead of following in your foot stamps."
3, 44, "Hermes", "Oh, it's true. But they grow up so fast. We just wanted a few more years of being better than them."
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "They're so stinking talented, they don't even need their fathers anymore."
3, 44, "Cubert", "Dad! We screwed up!"
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "You did? Tough luck, suckers!"
3, 44, "Dwight", "Please, help us, Pops. We agreed to deliver way more papers than we can handle."
3, 44, "Cubert", "But we couldn't handle them, so we started dumping the extras in a crater on the Moon."
3, 44, "Dwight", "And now everyone's yelling at us about our missing papers!"
3, 44, "Cubert", "And we don't know what to do!"
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Why did you boys do all this?"
3, 44, "Dwight", "We just wanted you to be proud of us."
3, 44, "Hermes", "Proud of you? You ruined us with sleazy business practices and a complete disregard for human decency. Of course we're proud of you!"
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Damn right we are! Now come on, let's go do a little father-son weaselling out of this."
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Good thing I had this net installed for catching giraffes."
3, 44, "Hermes", "OK, boys, let me show you how a paper man does it."
3, 44, "Little Prince", "Au revoir!"
3, 44, "Dwight", "Can I use the gun, Dad?"
3, 44, "Hermes", "Aw, what kind of father would I be if I said no?"
3, 44, "Dwight", "Only one house to go. We did it!  Run away! That bully, Bret Blob, lives there!"
3, 44, "Cubert", "He's ugly mean stupid stink mucus! And last week we sort of ... broke his window."
3, 44, "Hermes", "Alright, alright. What do we do when we break somebody's window?"
3, 44, "Dwight", "Pay for it?"
3, 44, "Hermes", "Oh, heavens, no! We apologise, with nice, cheap words!"
3, 44, "Bret", "I thought I heard the doorbell but I see it was the dorkbell!"
3, 44, "Dwight", "Man, you're funny. Good one, Bret."
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Now, now, no need to give us the business. We'd like a word with you daddy."
3, 44, "Bret", "Whatever.  Dad!"
3, 44, "Hermes", "Don't worry, boys. I'm sure his father is a perfectly normal, reasonable man."
3, 44, "Horrible Gelatinous Blob", "What the hell do you want?"
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Mr. Blob, our sons have come to apologise for damaging your window. They've learned their lesson and they want to make amends."
3, 44, "Cubert", "Sorry, sir."
3, 44, "Dwight", "Yeah, sorry."
3, 44, "Horrible Gelatinous Blob", "You can shove your apology into the bottom of your one-way digestive system."
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Now see here. We assured our sons that you'd accept their apology."
3, 44, "Horrible Gelatinous Blob", "Aww. Tell you what, I'll accept their apology when they kiss my ass! Which I don't have!"
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "No one gives my boy that option!"
3, 44, "Hermes", "Bring it on, Jello-pop!"
3, 44, "Cubert", "Yeah, get him, Dad!"
3, 44, "Dwight", "Show 'em who's boss!  Get 'em ... Pops!"
3, 44, "Cubert", "Right."
3, 44, "Cubert", "That was incredible! You are the bravest dads in the entire trauma centre!"
3, 44, "Dwight", "You guys almost had him ... until he digested you."
3, 44, "Hermes", "Oh, you're good kids.  If I could feel anything right now, it would be pride.  I was wrong! I can still feel pain!"
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "He's come to finish the job! Someone toss me out the window!"
3, 44, "Horrible Gelatinous Blob", "No, no, wait. I-I feel terrible about what happened. I-I've just been under a lot of stress lately down at the plant, y'know. They're-They're bringing in computers to ""improve productivity"" and, well, that's no excuse for how I acted. But the boy needs to see that real men solve their disagreements with words, not violence, so, uh, if you'll accept my apology, well, I hope we can put this embarrassing incident behind us."
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "I suppose."
3, 44, "Bender", "Hey, chumps, I heard you were on the ass-end of an ass-kicking so I figured you could use a couple these little babies."
3, 44, "Hermes", "Oh, why not? Might as well live it up as long as I've got this catheter in me!"
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "Won't you join us, Mr. Blob?"
3, 44, "Horrible Gelatinous Blob", "Sounds like a plan!"
3, 44, "Hermes", "This is what makes life worth clinging to; three fathers enjoying a day out with their sons."
3, 44, "Farnsworth", "It would seem we've taught our boys a lesson about life"
3, 45, "Bender", "Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, uh-huh, uh-huhWell, Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride,Blah, blah, blah, something, Bender is great!Froggy went a-courtin' and Bender is great, uh-huh--"
3, 45, "Fry", "Oh, my God! They dug up a bag of olestra chips from my time!  There must be layers and layers of old stuff down there."
3, 45, "Bender", "What's that? One of those Led Zeppelins I've heard so much about?"
3, 45, "Fry", "No, it's an old Volkswagen van.   Hey, Mister? Mind if I take this old van?"
3, 45, "Sal", "Sure. You wanna dump the corpses out of theres, it's yourses."
3, 45, "Fry", "Yeah, yeah, I've gotten used cars before."
3, 45, "Leela", "What's that? One of those Jefferson Starships I've heard so much about?"
3, 45, "Fry", "It's called a van, and in light of the fact that it's not a-rockin', I invite you to come a-knockin'!"
3, 45, "Amy", "Wow, neat."
3, 45, "Hermes", "It's a triumph of free-spirited German engineering."
3, 45, "Amy", "Hey, the speedometer only goes up to 80. This thing can't go faster than 80,000 miles an hour?"
3, 45, "Fry", "No, it can't, but it's got a driver's-side floor and an 8-track player with genuine mono sound."
3, 45, "Farnsworth", "Where's the device that lets you speed or slow the passage of time?"
3, 45, "Fry", "Under the seat."
3, 45, "Leela", "Why won't it start?"
3, 45, "Fry", "It just needs some gas."
3, 45, "Farnsworth", "Wrong again, idiot. There is no gas. Petroleum reserves ran dry in 2038."
3, 45, "Leela", "Gas was an environmental disaster, anyway. Now we use alternative fuels."
3, 45, "Fry", "Like what?"
3, 45, "Leela", "Whale oil.  Bender, lift it up to the can opener."
3, 45, "Bender", "Oh, no! I'm not going near it. Last time, that magnetic psycho nearly cut my head off."
3, 45, "Fry", "Oh, right. Plus, the magnet screws up your inhibition unit and makes you sing folk songs."
3, 45, "Bender", "What? Who said anything about me secretly wanting to be a folk singer? How ridiculous."
3, 45, "Fry", "Bender, if you don't open that can right now, your fear will own you, and nothing that can opener could ever do would be worse than that."
3, 45, "Bender", "OK, OK, I can do this. It's time to take life by the cans."
3, 45, "Leela", "Come on!"
3, 45, "Hermes", "You can do it!"
3, 45, "Amy", "Bender!"
3, 45, "Farnsworth", "Go on, you dummy."
3, 45, "Bender", "Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,"
3, 45, "Fry", "Oh, no!"
3, 45, "Bender", "Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,Cause the master's gone away."
3, 45, "Zoidberg", "It's toe-tapping-ly tragic."
3, 45, "Bender", "Doc, I can't move my arms and legs. What's wrong with me?"
3, 45, "Doctor", "This is the worst part of the job."
3, 45, "Bender", "What is it, good news?"
3, 45, "Doctor", "Bender, your hydraulics are shot. You'll never move again."
3, 45, "Bender", "You mean--"
3, 45, "Doctor", "I'm sorry, you'll have to get a new one."
3, 45, "Fry", "Oh, no! This is terrible."
3, 45, "Zoidberg", "Poor Bender."
3, 45, "Farnsworth", "Well, let's drag him to the kerb."
3, 45, "Fry", "Wait a minute, Bender is my best friend. We can't just dump him in the gutter like Grandma's ashes."
3, 45, "Bender", "Oh, my life is over. I'll never know happiness again."
3, 45, "Robot", "Ho, ho! Hello there!"
3, 45, "Leela", "Look, Bender! It's Patch Cord Adams. He heals with the power of laughter."
3, 45, "Patch Cord Adams", "Come on, take it. What's the matter, can't move your arms?"
3, 45, "Bender", "Obviously not, or I'd be strangling you right now."
3, 45, "Patch Cord Adams", "Hey, here's a giggle!  Did you hear why they're using Windows 3000 as a prison guard?"
3, 45, "Fry", "No, why?"
3, 45, "Patch Cord Adams", "'Cause it always locks up."
3, 45, "Bender", "For the love of God, somebody kick his ass!"
3, 45, "Patch Cord Adams", "Well, so long. Get well soon.  Oh, well, so long anyway."
3, 45, "Bender", "Oh, I'm doomed. Everybody leave me alone. I don't wanna be seen this way."
3, 45, "Fry", "Aw, you look so sad. You want me to send Patch Cord Adams back in?"
3, 45, "Bender", "Hey, the blues. The tragic sound of other people's suffering. That's kind of a pick-me-up.  Wow, that was great."
3, 45, "Beck", "Hey, thanks. You a fan?"
3, 45, "Bender", "I dunno. Let me see.  Oh, my God, you're Beck! I'd get up to shake your hand and steal your wallet but my crappy body crapped out on me."
3, 45, "Beck", "Don't take it so hard. I used to miss my body too but then I fished this mannequin out of the 92c Store dumpster."
3, 45, "Bender", "Wow. We've sure got a lot in common, Beck. I always dreamed of being a musician-poet who transcends genres even as he re-invents them, just like you."
3, 45, "Beck", "So do it, robot. It's easier than it looks."
3, 45, "Bender", "Eh, thanks, but it's hopeless. I'll never be a musician now."
3, 45, "Beck", "Or maybe you'll be the best musician ever."
3, 45, "Bender", "What's this for?"
3, 45, "Beck", "Try and scrape it across your chest like a knife on burnt toast.  Come on, move those arms. Use the power of mental thinking. Make it dynamic.  Yeah-ee! Alright, congratulations, my friend."
3, 45, "Bender", "Why? 'Cause I can make annoying noises?"
3, 45, "Beck", "Exactly. I use those all the time in my music. Bender, I want you to become my new washboard player."
3, 45, "Bender", "Alright!  Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!"
3, 45, "Bender", "Well, that's my good friend, Beck. I'm off to rock a series of mid-level venues."
3, 45, "Hermes", "Kudos, Bender. You got mangled and now you're a singer. Both our dreams came true."
3, 45, "Fry", "Hey, I have an idea. Who wants to cram in my van and follow Bender on tour and live there, in the van?"
3, 45, "Zoidberg", "Oh, I don't know, Fry. I think I'm too poor to follow a band around in a van."
3, 45, "Beck", "Come on, move it! We gotta get to the concert and make the audience wait for it at the start."
3, 45, "Zoidberg", "Bad news, friends. My shell ran."
3, 45, "Amy", "Zoidberg, you idiot, my outfit. It's, it's--"
3, 45, "Leela", "Kinda cool."
3, 45, "Fry", "Yeah, I like it."
3, 45, "Amy", "Me too, now that I'm used to it."
3, 45, "Zoidberg", "Then it was all on purpose! You're lucky to have Zoidberg as a friend. But cross me, and I'll turn on you like that!"
3, 45, "Beck", "There's a destination a little up the road,From the habitations and the towns we know,A place we saw the lights turn low,The jigsaw jazz and the get-fresh glow,Pullin' out jives and jamboree handouts,Two turntables and a microphone,Bottles and cans just clap your hands,Just clap your hands."
3, 45, "All", "Where it's at!"
3, 45, "Bender", "Got a washboard stomach and a microphone."
3, 45, "Beck", "That was a washboard break."
3, 45, "Fry", "Oh, yeah!"
3, 45, "Amy", "Yeah!  One bowl of Jell-O knuckles, please."
3, 45, "Barman", "That'll be three pick-e-tures of George Washington."
3, 45, "Amy", "Oh, no! My beautiful money."
3, 45, "Leela", "It got ruined in the wash."
3, 45, "Fry", "Mine too, even my change."
3, 45, "Barman", "Get lost, you money-less hippies!"
3, 45, "Horrible Gelatinous Hick", "You heard him, freaks. We don't like your type around here. These are the types we like."
3, 45, "Beck", "Bender, that was the best 40-minute washboard solo I've ever heard. And the parts when I was awake blew my mind."
3, 45, "Bender", "Whoa, check out all those broken robots. Howdy, fellas!"
3, 45, "Robot #1", "I don't believe my broken eyes! It's Bender, the washboard player! Hey, man, we caught your concert from here."
3, 45, "Robot #2", "You rock!"
3, 45, "Fembot", "Oh, oh, Bender! Sign my chest! It's in that bin behind me."
3, 45, "Robot #3", "Yo, brother, thanks for showing that broken robots are still useful."
3, 45, "Bender", "Aw, hang in there, folks. I'll bet before you know it, you guys'll be--  That is so wrong. They can't just melt down broken robots. Not right when they're kissing my ass."
3, 45, "Beck", "Whoa, dog. Just cold chill.  You know, when I'm upset, I write a song about it. Like when I wrote Devil's Haircut, I was feeling really-- What's that song about?"
3, 45, "Bender", "Hey, yeah, I could write a song! With real words, not phoney ones like ""odelay""."
3, 45, "Beck", """Odelay"" is a word. Just look it up in the Becktionary."
3, 45, "Bender", "Ooh!"
3, 45, "Bender", "I'm working on my song. Hand me the Becktionary.  No, no, the rhyming Becktionary."
3, 45, "Beck", "I wish I could help raise awareness about broken robots. But what can I do? I only weigh eight pounds."
3, 45, "Bender", "Wait a minute, you know lots of rock stars, and most of them like to look like they care about things!"
3, 45, "Beck", "We can all get together for a big benefit concert in San Francisco!"
3, 45, "Bender", "And we could call it ""Bend-Aid"", after me, Bender!"
3, 45, "Beck", "And you can sing that song you're writing!"
3, 45, "Bender", "And I'll let you sing backup! But remember who the star is. Me"
3, 45, "Bender", "Alright. ""Hands in the air"" rhymes with ""Just don't care"" and ... finished!  Eck! Smells like something died in the wall!"
3, 45, "Fry", "Surprise!"
3, 45, "Leela", "Mind if we crash here tonight? The colours in the van are keeping us awake."
3, 45, "Bender", "Alright, but hands off the minibar."
3, 45, "Fry", "Wow, I forgot about TV. Living free on the road, you realise how much better life is without it. Well, let's see what's on."
3, 45, "Announcer #1", "Tuesday, Golden Gate Park, the monsters of vaguely-folkish alterna-rock will strum your brains out at Bend-Aid! Featuring Beck, Wailing Fungus and special guest, Bender!"
3, 45, "Announcer #2", "A portion of the proceeds might go to help broken robots."
3, 45, "Fry", "Yeah!"
3, 45, "Zoidberg", "Hooray, robot!"
3, 45, "Amy", "Bender, you're famous!"
3, 45, "Bender", "Yeah."
3, 45, "Leela", "This coming-together of superstars really means a lot to you, doesn't it, Bender?"
3, 45, "Bender", "Uh-huh. Helping my defective brothers is the first thing I've ever cared about, even the slightest bit. You know, when I first got broken, I thought my life was over. But look at me now"
3, 45, "Fry", "Bender, you can move! You're cured!"
3, 45, "Bender", "Oh, crap! It's a miracle!"
3, 45, "Bender", "I can move again.  My music career is over."
3, 45, "Fry", "Bender, I don't claim to understand ""the biz"" but wouldn't being able to move help your music career?"
3, 45, "Bender", "No, don't you see? I was a hero to broken robots 'cause I was one of them. But how can I sing about being damaged if I'm not? That's like Christina Aguilera singing in Spanish.  Wait, that's it! I'll fake it!"
3, 45, "Amy", "You'd better not do that at the concert."
3, 45, "Zoidberg", "I can't stop. When I eat too much dirt, I get stuff in my throat."
3, 45, "Amy", "You are so disgusting, I--"
3, 45, "Leela", "They're beautiful."
3, 45, "Zoidberg", "Ew, you're touching them!"
3, 45, "Amy", "I've never seen pearls like this. Dr. Zoidberg, you're amazing."
3, 45, "Zoidberg", "I am? At last! Recognition!"
3, 45, "Emcee", "Gentle hippies, put your filthy hands together for the folk stylings of Cylon and Garfunkel!"
3, 45, "Garfunkel", "Here's a song that was beautiful when performed by my ancestor, Art.(singing) Are you going to Scarborough Fair?"
3, 45, "Cylon", "and   Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme."
3, 45, "Garfunkel", "Remember me to one who loves there."
3, 45, "Cylon", "and   She once was a true love of mine."
3, 45, "Leela", "We're home."
3, 45, "Amy", "Well, let's earn some bread."
3, 45, "Fry", "Brothers and sisters, get your love beads. Can't journey to the centre of your mind without love beads!"
3, 45, "Hippie #1", "Wow, look at the colours. These'll go great with my soul."
3, 45, "Zoidberg", "Glad you like them. I've been making fine jewellery for years, apparently."
3, 45, "Hippie #2", "I'll take three."
3, 45, "Hippie #3", "Give me one, man!"
3, 45, "Hippie #4", "I'll trade you a bad poem!"
3, 45, "Emcee", "And now, stand up and turn on your hidden tape recorders for ... Beck! With special guest, Bender, the broken robot."
3, 45, "Fry", "Bender rules!"
3, 45, "Hippie #5", "Groove on, man!"
3, 45, "Leela", "Rock it, Bender!"
3, 45, "Zoidberg", "Play that thing!"
3, 45, "Beck", "Can't you hear those cavalry drums,Hijacking your equilibrium..."
3, 45, "Bender", "Whoa-oh, yeah!"
3, 45, "Beck", "...Midnight hags in the mausoleum,"
3, 45, "Beck", "Thank you. That song doesn't usually last three hours, but we got into a serious thing ... and then I forgot how it ended. Anyway, one last item of business before we go."
3, 45, "Garfunkel", "Bender, to start your foundation for broken robots, here's a big, cardboard cheque for $14,000."
3, 45, "Cylon", "It's been an emotional day for me."
3, 45, "Bender", "I don't know what to say."
3, 45, "Beck", "Then maybe you should sing it. Lay it down, boys."
3, 45, "Bender", "Ladies, gentlemen, smoking heaps of machinery ...  ... this is a song called My Broken Friend.(singing) People say my broken friend is useless,But I say his mind is free,There's lots of things my mangled robot friend could be,"
3, 45, "Beck", "Kick it!"
3, 45, "Bender", "He could make a good..."
3, 45, "Bender", "and   ...hat-rack"
3, 45, "Beck", "He only has to stand there,"
3, 45, "Bender", "Or a cheap..."
3, 45, "Bender", "and   ...doorstop,"
3, 45, "Beck", "He doesn't need to move"
3, 45, "Bender", "Or a great big..."
3, 45, "Bender", "and   ...giant Thermos,"
3, 45, "Bender", "With a twist-off top,"
3, 45, "Beck", "That would be good for soup,"
3, 45, "Bender", "He could be a storage closet..."
3, 45, "Bender", "and   ...for outdated pants,"
3, 45, "Beck", "I like 'em tight!"
3, 45, "Bender", "My broken friend could do it all,"
3, 45, "Bender", "and   Just give him a chance!"
3, 45, "Bender", "That robot has a tragic secret,That I'd like to share..."
3, 45, "Beck", "For real?"
3, 45, "Bender", "...My broken friend is closer to me,Than an ass to a chair..."
3, 45, "Beck", "Hm."
3, 45, "Bender", "...That robot's name I never told you..."
3, 45, "Beck", "Who's that?"
3, 45, "Bender", "...You could not foresee..."
3, 45, "Beck", "C'mon, give it up."
3, 45, "Bender", "...I'll say it loud and sing it proud..."
3, 45, "Bender", "and   His name is you and me."
3, 45, "Bender", "Don't melt me down into a crowbar,"
3, 45, "Beck", "It suffers alone,"
3, 45, "Bender", "Just 'cause I can't move my arms and legs,"
3, 45, "Beck", "Hey."
3, 45, "Bender", "Or toss me into a trash can..."
3, 45, "Beck", "Bender, what are you doing?"
3, 45, "Bender", "...Just 'cause I can't cook you ham and eggs..."
3, 45, "Beck", "What are you doing?"
3, 45, "Bender", "...Don't crush me into an anchor..."
3, 45, "Beck", "Yo! What's the dealy-o?"
3, 45, "Bender", "...Just 'cause I can't jump and dance and sing..."
3, 45, "Beck", "Hold it! What? No!"
3, 45, "Bender", "...I'm telling you, my broken friend..."
3, 45, "Beck", "B-Bender."
3, 45, "Bender", "...Put your hands in the air like you just don't care!"
3, 45, "Beck", "No!"
3, 45, "Bender", "I'm telling you, my broken friend..."
3, 45, "Beck", "Cut it!"
3, 45, "Bender", "...Can do 'most anything!"
3, 45, "Beck", "Cut it!"
3, 45, "Bender", "Yeah!"
3, 45, "Beck", "Cut it!"
3, 45, "Bender", "Curse my natural showmanship!"
3, 45, "Robot #4", "You big, fat fraud! You're not really broken!"
3, 45, "Robot #5", "But you will be in a minute! Bum-rush the stage!"
3, 45, "Robot #6", "Get him!"
3, 45, "Hippie #6", "Oh, harsh! I didn't get my beads."
3, 45, "Beck", "You, minion, lift up my arm.  After him!"
3, 45, "Bender", "Well, everyone, prepare to get your guts kicked out by folk singers."
3, 45, "Caterpillar Alien", "What is this? The Year of the Jerk?"
3, 45, "Fry", "Hurry! The Golden Gate Bridge! Put the metal to the pedal to the other metal."
3, 45, "Bender", "Oh, no! I forgot this is a hoverbridge."
3, 45, "Leela", "And I forgot this isn't a hovercar."
3, 45, "Fry", "Is any of that a problem?"
3, 45, "Zoidberg", "Not if you've lived a life without regret."
3, 45, "Bender", "I'll save me!"
3, 45, "Leela", "Quick, grab his footcups."
3, 45, "Bender", "Hey? What? No."
3, 45, "Fry", "Phew!"
3, 45, "Leela", "Bummer."
3, 45, "Bender", "Someone fat get in my way!   I'm broken again. I can't move any part of me."
3, 45, "Beck", "Good."
3, 45, "Bender", "I'm really sorry I lied, Beck. All I ever wanted was to make music with you. I never meant to hurt anyone, or help anyone."
3, 45, "Beck", "Bender, that's some played-out, new-jack, horse crap-- But I know you don't mean it so apology accepted."
3, 45, "Bender", "So, I can, uh, keep the cheque?"
3, 45, "Garfunkel", "Over my dead career!"
3, 45, "Bender", "Well, it was worth a shot."
3, 45, "Fry", "C'mon, Bender. If you're done scamming Beck, we're heading home."
3, 45, "Bender", "Alright, alright. Let me just do one thing to cheer myself up.Fry cracked corn,And I don't care,Leela cracked corn,I still don't care,Bender cracked corn,And he is great!Take that, you stupid corn!"
3, 46, "Hermes", "Go get it, boy!"
3, 46, "Fry", "So, Leela, how about a romantic ride in one of those swan boats? They're kinda dangerous but I finally mastered them."
3, 46, "Leela", "Those aren't swan boats, they're swans."
3, 46, "Fry", "Oh. That explains these boat eggs."
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Wha?"
3, 46, "Tate", "Pitiful ballplayers of Earth, I am Ethan ""Bubblegum"" Tate, commander of the Harlem Globetrotters.  For generations, your puny planet has lived in peace with the Globetrotter Homeworld. But now, for no reason, we challenge you to defend your honour on the basketball court.  Will no one meet our challenge? Have none of you pathetic Earthlings game?"
3, 46, "Fry", "What happens if we lose?"
3, 46, "Tate", "Nothing. There's nothing at stake and no threat, beyond the shame of defeat!"
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "This will not stand!  I'll take you on, you air-balling bozos."
3, 46, "Tate", "You, old man? Sweet Clyde, laugh derisively at him."
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "I may be an old man. In fact, I'm fairly sure I am. But I'll put you Globetrotters in your place with my team of mutant atomic supermen!"
3, 46, "Hermes", "Hooray, Professor!"
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Behold"
3, 46, "Leela", "They're only a foot high, Professor."
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Well, they're still young. Mere atomic super boys, really. We'll need to speed up their growth with time particles called Chronitons."
3, 46, "Bender", "Aren't those the particles that destroyed an entire civilisa--"
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Good news, everyone! You're off to the Tempus Nebula to gather Chronitons."
3, 46, "Fry", "Hey, Leela, look at me!"
3, 46, "Leela", "Your face can take a lot of punishment. That's good to know."
3, 46, "Fry", "There's a lot about my face you don't know! Perhaps you and it could get better acquainted over dinner."
3, 46, "Leela", "Alright! Cool your jets, hotshot."
3, 46, "Fry", "C'mon, Leela, why won't you go out with me? We both know there's something there."
3, 46, "Leela", "No, I mean cool your jets. They're melting Bender's face."
3, 46, "Bender", "Ow! Oh, my God! Ow!"
3, 46, "Leela", "Here you go. Hot off the nebula."
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "None too soon. While you were gone the Trotters held a news conference to announce that I was a jive sucker.  Behold! My invincible nuclear mutants."
3, 46, "Amy", "Hi!"
3, 46, "Arachneon", "Hello!"
3, 46, "Albert", "Marv Albert here at Madison Cube Garden where the Harlem Globetrotters take on a squad of atomic supermen in what promises to be a by-the-numbers athletic contest with no surprises whatsoever.  Here's the tip-off. Globetrotter ball. Sweet Clyde Dixon to Bubblegum Tate. Drives down-court-- And Curly Joe from the rear."
3, 46, "Zoidberg", "That one grabbed his behindus!"
3, 46, "Leela", "Sh!"
3, 46, "Hermes", "Quiet!"
3, 46, "Tate", "Who dares laugh at the Jesters of Dunk? We came to terrify and humiliate you, not tickle your funnybones. Watch as I embarrass your civilisation by passing the ball to Curly Joe.  Only to have it remain in my hands with elastic.  And perhaps this will wipe the smiles from your faces."
3, 46, "Albert", "Goosh goes up.  Rejected! Grotrian from half-court.  Yes!"
3, 46, "Albert", "Supermen lead 45-42. Arachneon with the steal, to Thorias. Thorias from downtown!  Yes! He's really showing us what a man with a cannon in his chest can do!"
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "No showboarding, you atomic hotdog!"
3, 46, "Albert", "And that's the half, with the Supermen up 48-42. Surprisingly dull, so far.  Bubblegum, the Trotters are down by six. Reactions?"
3, 46, "Tate", "It was always our plan to trail at the half, thus deepening Earth's eventual humiliation. Also, what game were the refs watching?"
3, 46, "Albert", "Curly Joe, easily amused by his own antics ...  ... continues to wreak havoc on--"
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "What the--  Did everything just jump around, or did my brain just stroke off there for a second?"
3, 46, "Albert", "Ladies and gentlemen, something very strange has just happened in this basketball game between space clowns and atomic monsters."
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Time-out! Time-out!"
3, 46, "Fry", "What's happening?"
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "We seem to be lurching forward randomly in time, like a needle skipping on a record player."
3, 46, "Amy", "What's causing it? Is it my outfit?"
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "No. It must have something to do with those time particles I used to grow the Supermen. Time and space are ripping apart at the seams."
3, 46, "Thorias", "Oops!"
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Oh, great! Now, on top of everything, we need a new fifth man."
3, 46, "Fry", "Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Put me in, Professor. I wanna show Leela my skills."
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Hmm. Will said skills pay the bills?"
3, 46, "Fry", "Who cares? We're 35 points ahead with two minutes left. What could possibly--"
3, 46, "Albert", "Globetrotters win, 244-86. A dark day for humanity, folks. We have been beaten ... in basketball."
3, 46, "Curly Joe", "Yeah, that's how we do it!"
3, 46, "'Sweet' Clyde", "How's that?"
3, 46, "Tate", "You are all fools of the highest calibre."
3, 46, "Leela", "I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again you screwed up. Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas."
3, 46, "Hermes", "I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day."
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes. We have bigger problems. This time disruption is extremely serious."
3, 46, "Tate", "Damn right, brother man. This chronological wang-dang-doodle could destroy the very matrix of reality."
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Tate? What do you know about this?"
3, 46, "Tate", "Not much, yet. But I am senior lecturer of physics at Globetrotter U. And I'd like to help you investigate."
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "You're that Bubblegum Tate?"
3, 46, "Tate", "Well I sure ain't his grandma. Now look here, Prof.  I think we got ourselves an excess of Chronitons in the subatomic interstices."
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Yes, I see. Something involving that many big words could easily destabilise time itself."
3, 46, "Fry", "Is that a problem?"
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Indeed so. At this rate, by Tuesday it will be Thursday; by Wednesday, it will be August; and by Thursday, it will be the end of existence as we know it."
3, 46, "Man", "I'll have to ask you to clear out now. The circus need to set up for tomorrow's big--"
3, 46, "Linda", "Time continues to skip forward randomly. Details at 11."
3, 46, "Linda", "This is the news at 11. The mysterious and unexplained--"
3, 46, "Linda", "Turning to entertainment news, teen singer Wendy might just be the latest--"
3, 46, "Linda", "--won three Grammys last night--"
3, 46, "Linda", "--found dead in her bathtub."
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Interesting. It's as if we behave normally during the time skips, but then we have no memory of it."
3, 46, "Fry", "You mean we just--"
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "My, yes. Ooh, just like that. Any luck, Bubblegum?"
3, 46, "Tate", "Not yet. Listen, I hope you don't mind if I dribble a little while I work."
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Not if you'll grant me the same liberty."
3, 46, "Bender", "Ooh! Ooh! Bubblegum? My name's Bender and I'm a huge fan of your work, both on and off the court. Can I be a Globetrotter?"
3, 46, "Tate", "Shut up, turkey."
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Bubblegum, look at this. The background time radiation is fluctuating wildly."
3, 46, "Tate", "Good Lord! That sucker's shaking around like some fine, imported booty."
3, 46, "Hermes", "Say, I'm no physicist, but I think I know how to stop the skipping. We'll just--"
3, 46, "Hermes", "I don't know how this was suppose to work."
3, 46, "Amy", "Professor, I hope you find out what's wrong before we skip right past my birth--"
3, 46, "All", "--ppy birthday, Amy."
3, 46, "Amy", "Hooray! Look at all these presents!"
3, 46, "Zoidberg", "I hope we all have as much tomorrow at my birth--"
3, 46, "Zoidberg", "What?"
3, 46, "Fry", "Psst! Leela. I've set up a time-proof shelter in the closet. There's only room for two, and you're the one I wanna share it with."
3, 46, "Leela", "Fry, that's so sweet. Let me see."
3, 46, "Leela", "How exactly will this protect us from time jumps?"
3, 46, "Fry", "Because when we're together in here, baby, time will stand still."
3, 46, "Fry", "Ow!"
3, 46, "Zoidberg", "Hmm.  Hmm."
3, 46, "Leela", "Dr. Zoidberg, can I talk to you about Fry?"
3, 46, "Zoidberg", "Leela, I would be honoured."
3, 46, "Leela", "--does the worst W.C. Fields imitation I've ever seen. Zoidberg!"
3, 46, "Zoidberg", "Sorry, you must have been boring me."
3, 46, "Leela", "The thing is, Fry is very sweet, but he's so immature. I love his boyish charm but I hate his childishness."
3, 46, "Zoidberg", "So he's not perfect. You don't wanna end up old and lonely like Zoidberg!  You were saying?"
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Ah, there is it. The Tempus Nebula. Take a whiff through the Smellescope."
3, 46, "Tate", "What's that funky jazz?"
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "The odour of pure time leaking. When my crew removed the Chronitons, it destabilised the nebula, causing time skips throughout the universe."
3, 46, "Bender", "Ooh! Let Bubblegum tell it."
3, 46, "Tate", "Pretend these basketballs are time particles, my silver honky. As the nebula bounce-passes them off us ...  ... they cause these dents, or ""time skips""."
3, 46, "Bender", "You are so smart!"
3, 46, "Tate", "Hold up. What if we were to move this cluster of starts to these algebraic co-ordinates?"
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Their gravity might just divert the Chronitons to the empty side of the universe."
3, 46, "Tate", "Yeah. But is it possible? Moving stars would require one bad-ass gravity pump. And we'd need all the money on Earth to--"
3, 46, "Tate", "What the--"
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Wha?"
3, 46, "Nixon", "Here's the funding for your gravity pump. But it damn well better work! We can't spend all of Earth's money every day. Now, how long will it take to build?"
3, 46, "Tate", "It won't be easy, Nixon. A jim-jam this complex might take months or even--"
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Ah, there we are. One gravity pump.  Powerful enough to move the stars themselves. Now to begin the arduous task of attaching it to the ship so th--"
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Off you go, apparently."
3, 46, "Tate", "Easy, Leela. Just finger-roll that star to the cosmic basket."
3, 46, "Leela", "Just a few ... more ... hundred ... thousand ... miles. There!"
3, 46, "Tate", "Nothing but nebula!"
3, 46, "Leela", "We'll have to run some tests back on Earth, but I think we've stopped the time skips."
3, 46, "Bender", "Alright!"
3, 46, "Tate", "Jamming!"
3, 46, "Fry", "Hooray for Leela!"
3, 46, "Bender", "And what better way to celebrate our success than by me showing Bubblegum the Globetrotter uniform I made myself!"
3, 46, "Tate", "Let me see.  Hello, lawsuit!"
3, 46, "Fry", "Leela, I want you to know I think the way you moved those stars around was really wonderful. I got you something."
3, 46, "Leela", "Moderately-priced, domestic, non-vintage champagne? How did you know?"
3, 46, "Fry", "You deserve it. I mean, nobody ever stops to tell you what a great captain you are."
3, 46, "Leela", "Aw! That is so true and sweet."
3, 46, "Fry", "You're smart, you're beautiful, and best of all, you'll go out with me-e?"
3, 46, "Leela", "Fry, please try to understand"
3, 46, "Bender", "Hey, Leela. Bubblegum might let me organise a bake sale for the Globetrotter wives. Can you teach me to make cupcakes?"
3, 46, "Leela", "Alright, but I wanna lick the beaters."
3, 46, "Fry", "I got her champagne, I opened it. What does a guy have to do?"
3, 46, "Tate", "86 the chump stuff, F-man. It's time to win Leela's heart with a big-showy, three-point romantic gesture."
3, 46, "Fry", "Hmm. Maybe this is the moment to show her my real surprise."
3, 46, "Leela", "Fry, what are you doing?"
3, 46, "Tate", "Uh-oh. Time to boogie on down to the sauna!"
3, 46, "Fry", "Look. I've been studying how to pilot the ship. Impressed?"
3, 46, "Leela", "Yeah, actually. You're doing OK. The core reactor temperature's nominal, the blinker's off."
3, 46, "Fry", "I learned how to work the gravity pump too. In case we need to move more stars. So, are we dating now?"
3, 46, "Leela", "Is that what this is all about? Please, just cut it out now."
3, 46, "Fry", "Look, Leela. I know there's some perfect, amazing thing I can do to make you love me, and when I figure out what it is--"
3, 46, "Leela", "Fry, stop. I don't wanna hurt you, but there is absolutely, positively no way that you and I will ever, ever--"
3, 46, "Preacherbot", "--man and wife. You may kiss the bride."
3, 46, "Albert", "Yes!"
3, 46, "Zoidberg", "He looks radiant!"
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Ye Gods, Bubblegum! We failed. The time skips haven't stopped at all."
3, 46, "Tate", "Even in these formal shorts, I feel like a failure."
3, 46, "Leela", "You tricked me into marrying you, didn't you?"
3, 46, "Fry", "Of course not."
3, 46, "Leela", "How'd you do it? Drugs in the champagne? Hypnosis?"
3, 46, "Fry", "No! Drugs are for losers and hypnosis is for losers with big, weird eyebrows. I don't know what amazing thing I did you make you love me but, whatever it was, we're married now. We've got the rest of our lives to work--"
3, 46, "Whitey", "Divorce is final."
3, 46, "Fry", "What?"
3, 46, "Leela", "Well, let's divide up the china. I guess I'll take the NFC helmets and you can have the AFC helmets."
3, 46, "Fry", "Fine. Break my heart again."
3, 46, "Zoidberg", "Don't be so hard on yourself, Fry. You lost the woman of your dreams but you still have Zoidberg. You all still have Zoidberg."
3, 46, "Fry", "How did I do it? How did I get Leela to love me? I've got to figure it out."
3, 46, "Hermes", "Maybe you're just a fantastic lover, Fry."
3, 46, "Amy", "Um, no."
3, 46, "Fry", "I don't know what I'm doing."
3, 46, "Bender", "Maybe she'd come back to you if your best friend Bender were a Globetrotter. What do you say, Bubblegum?"
3, 46, "Tate", "Hell, no."
3, 46, "Fry", "Oh, it's hopeless. I did something so great that it won Leela's heart and I'll never, ever know what it was. My life is empty."
3, 46, "Zoidberg", "Zoidberg!"
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "No wonder we failed to stop the time skips. Diverting Chronitons is mathematically impossible. I knew I should have checked your show-boating Globetrotter algebra."
3, 46, "Tate", "Man, I thought you knew that algebra was all razz-ma-tazz. A Globetrotter always saves the good algebra for the final minutes."
3, 46, "Bender", "Vintage Bubblegum!"
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "The time skips are worse than ever now. Isolated spots are jumping by years at a time. Look."
3, 46, "Boy", "Stupid senior citizens. Why should we have to pay for their social security benefits?"
3, 46, "Old Man", "I deserve free money!"
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Well, I'm stumped. We'll have to call in the finest scientific minds in the univ--"
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Perhaps we could explode the whole damned nebula. What do you think, Curly Joe?"
3, 46, "Curly Joe", "No, man. An explosion big enough to destroy that mama would take out half the universe."
3, 46, "Sweet Clyde", "You gotta Globetrotter that explosion up a little, Farnsy. Make it an implosion."
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "By God, Sweet Clyde is right. An implosion might just form a black hole that would stop more Chronitons from escaping."
3, 46, "Tate", "Whoa. Slow that brain train down, Prof. We'd need some kind of doomsday device to initiate an implosion like that."
3, 46, "Farnsworth", "Doomsday device? Ah! Now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!  I suppose I could part with one and still be feared."
3, 46, "Tate", "Give me some skin, Prof. I'm making you an honorary Globetrotter. In fact, everybody in this room's an honorary Globetrotter."
3, 46, "Amy", "Hooray!"
3, 46, "Hermes", "Yes!"
3, 46, "Zoidberg", "I'm a Globetrotter!"
3, 46, "Bender", "Did you just say--"
3, 46, "Tate", "Too late, hot plate."
3, 46, "Bender", "Oh, crap."
3, 46, "Tate", "We must leave now, for we are needed elsewhere. But we wish you Godspeed."
3, 46, "Bender", "Please, please let me come with you. I can make myself taller."
3, 46, "Tate", "Bender, you can talk trash, you can handle the ball. But look in your heart and ask yourself"
3, 46, "Bender", "Yes."
3, 46, "Tate", "Are you?"
3, 46, "Bender", "I mean, with time, my funk level could--"
3, 46, "Tate", "Are you?"
3, 46, "Bender", "No."
3, 46, "Tate", "Deal with it."
3, 46, "Bender", "Oh! No!"
3, 46, "Leela", "Careful with that doomsday device, Bender."
3, 46, "Bender", "What does it matter? I'll never be a Globetrotter. My life, and, by extension, everyone else's, is meaningless."
3, 46, "Leela", "Roger."
3, 46, "Fry", "Leela, about the wedding. I don't know what I did to make you love me, and I don't think I tricked you into it, but maybe I did. And if I did, I'm sorry."
3, 46, "Leela", "It's OK, Fry. You know we'll always be friends, right?"
3, 46, "Fry", "Yeah. But I don't guess anything I could do will ever make you feel the same way about me that I do about you."
3, 46, "Leela", "I guess not."
3, 46, "Bender", "Well, the doomsday device is ready. Maybe blasting this quadrant of space into a hell storm of flaming nothingness will cheer me up a little."
3, 46, "Leela", "OK. Let me just take the ship out to a safe distance.  Actually, I think I'll go down and prep the detonator. Fry, why don't you take the helm?"
3, 46, "Fry", "She's so great. I feel like I can almost remember the magical thing I did to make her love me. But I guess I never will."
3, 46, "Bender", "Sorry, buddy. I too know what it's like to have a dream I'll never achieve."
3, 46, "Fry", "Oh!  That's how I must have done it! I moved the stars themselves to write her a love note in the sky."
3, 46, "Leela", "Detonation in three, two, one."
3, 46, "Fry", "No!  Did you see it? Did you see it?"
3, 46, "Bender", "The explosion?"
3, 46, "Fry", "No, not the explosion!"
3, 46, "Leela", "Then what?"
3, 46, "Fry", "Nothing."
3, 47, "Narrator", "You're entering a realm which is unusual. Maybe it's magic or contains some kind of monster. The second one. Prepare to enter ... The Scary Door.  Please send a man round back and pick up Clyde Smith, a professional gambler who's about to have an unfortunate accident."
3, 47, "Smith", "A casino where I'm winning? That car musta killed me. I must be in heaven!  A casino where I always win? That's boring. I must really be ... in hell!"
3, 47, "Sebastian Cabot", "No, Mr. Smith. You're not in heaven or hell. You're on an aeroplane."
3, 47, "Smith", "There's a gremlin destroying the plane! You've gotta believe me!"
3, 47, "Sebastian Cabot", "Why should I believe you? You're Hitler!"
3, 47, "Smith", "No!  Eva Braun! Help me!"
3, 47, "Bender", "Saw it comin'!"
3, 47, "Fry", "I just saw something incredibly cool"
3, 47, "Amy", "Was it out in front of Discount Shoe Outlet?"
3, 47, "Fry", "Yeah."
3, 47, "Amy", "They have a college kid wear that to attract customers."
3, 47, "Fry", "Well I don't care if it was some dork in a costume. For one brief moment I felt the heartbeat of creation, and it was one with my own."
3, 47, "Amy", "Big deal!"
3, 47, "Bender", "We all feel like that all the time. You don't hear us gassin' on about it."
3, 47, "Fry", "How can you people be so blasé? Here you are in the year 3000 or so, yet you just sit around like it's the boring time I came from."
3, 47, "Farnsworth", "Boring? Wasn't that the period when they cracked the human genome and boy bands roamed the Earth?"
3, 47, "Fry", "Yeah. But now it's the distant future. Why aren't we out doing everything I ever dreamed of?"
3, 47, "Leela", "Hey, you know what might be a hoot?"
3, 47, "Farnsworth", "No. Why would I know that?"
3, 47, "Leela", "Let's take the rest of the morning off and take Fry to do everything he ever wanted to do."
3, 47, "Fry", "Everything?"
3, 47, "Leela", "Except that."
3, 47, "Sal", "Sos your fantasies has always been to destroys a planet, huh?"
3, 47, "Fry", "Yeah, what did they ever do for me?"
3, 47, "Leela", "Wow! The most humdrum activities look almost exciting through your eyes. What should we do next?"
3, 47, "Fry", "I wanna see the edge of the universe!"
3, 47, "Amy", "Ooh! That sounds cool."
3, 47, "Zoidberg", "It's funny. You live in the universe, but you never do these things till someone comes to visit."
3, 47, "Farnsworth", "There it is! The edge of the universe!"
3, 47, "Fry", "Far out! So there's an infinite number of parallel universes?"
3, 47, "Farnsworth", "No, just the two."
3, 47, "Fry", "Oh, well, I'm sure that's enough."
3, 47, "Bender", "I'm sick of parallel Bender lording his cowboy hat over me! Let's move on to Fry's next fantasy."
3, 47, "Fry", "Yee-haw! Bow before your master, puny mortals!  Giddy-up!"
3, 47, "Girl", "Mommy, why is that man like that?"
3, 47, "Mother", "Don't look at him!"
3, 47, "Fry", "That was fun. Let's give him a treat!"
3, 47, "Leela", "Keep your palms flat."
3, 47, "Fry", "The tongue tickles."
3, 47, "Fry", "These new hands are great. I'm gonna break 'em in tonight."
3, 47, "Farnsworth", "Yes, it's been quite an hour and a half."
3, 47, "Fry", "I've only got two fantasies left"
3, 47, "Bender", "I could pound your head till you think that's what happened."
3, 47, "Fry", "OK."
3, 47, "Leela", "Wait, hold on. It is actually possible to meet any celebrity you want."
3, 47, "Fry", "It is?"
3, 47, "Leela", "Of course! You should read a blimp sometime."
3, 47, "Fry", "Download a celebrity from the Internet? What part of that do I understand?"
3, 47, "Leela", "It's simple. You can download a celebrity's personality and appearance into a blank robot."
3, 47, "Fry", "Hey, I have an idea. Let's do that!"
3, 47, "Farnsworth", "Onto the Internet you go!"
3, 47, "Bender", "Oh, and while you're there, pick me up a few credit card numbers."
3, 47, "Trekkie #1", "No way! Kirk could kick Picard's ass!"
3, 47, "Trekkie #2", "Yeah? At least Picard had the guts to admit he was bald!"
3, 47, "Trekkie #1", "What? You take that back!"
3, 47, "Fry", "Ooh! eBay!"
3, 47, "Auctioneer", "Are there no further bids for this exquisite galaxy?  Sold to The Being of Inconceivable Horror."
3, 47, "The Being of Inconceivable Horror", "Will a money order be OK?"
3, 47, "Auctioneer", "Yes."
3, 47, "Fry", "So where's the celebrity dating place?"
3, 47, "Leela", "Let's search the web.  Over there."
3, 47, "Salesman", "Welcome to Nappster. Let's see what celebrities we've got in stock.  Can I interest you in Gwyneth Paltrow?"
3, 47, "Fry", "Nah. I read in Newsweek that she drinks human blood."
3, 47, "Salesman", "Then, uh, how about Cleopatra, whose beauty destroyed mighty empires."
3, 47, "Fry", "I'd prefer someone from the era of shaved underarms. Do you have anything with more of a Lucy-Liu-feel to it?"
3, 47, "Salesman", "Nah, nothing like that. Though we do have Lucy Liu.  Only woman ever to be named People magazine's sexiest woman of the year twice. In 2003, and then again in 2063."
3, 47, "Fry", "I'd like the 2003 model."
3, 47, "Fry", "I've found her! What do I do now?"
3, 47, "Farnsworth", "Download her. Let's just put a blank robot in the drive."
3, 47, "Fry", "It worked!"
3, 47, "Liubot", "You're one sexy man,  Philip J. Fry."
3, 47, "Fry", "It worked perfectly!"
3, 47, "Leela", "Well, you downloaded Lucy Liu. Are you just going to stare vacantly at her and not say anything?"
3, 47, "Liubot", "I find your slack-jawed stare very attractive,  Philip J. Fry."
3, 47, "Fry", "Did you hear that? She likes me!"
3, 47, "Farnsworth", "Well, duh! She's programmed to like you!"
3, 47, "Fry", "But this is Lucy Liu! Perhaps the only good actress of the 21st century! She's more than just a piece of software."
3, 47, "Liubot", "Would you like to take a moment to register me?"
3, 47, "Fry", "Uh, not right now."
3, 47, "Liubot", "I'll remind you later, you hot stud, you!"
3, 47, "Fry", "So, uh, what do you feel like doing?"
3, 47, "Liubot", "Would you like to take a moment to register me?"
3, 47, "Fry", "I said later!"
3, 47, "Fry", "Then when I feel so stuffed I can't eat anymore, I just use the restroom, and then I can eat more."
3, 47, "Liubot", "You should write a book, Fry. People need to know about the  can eat more."
3, 47, "Fry", "Oh, Lucy! You're just like I always thought you'd be from your movies."
3, 47, "Liubot", "My personality is mathematically derived from my movies, proportionally weighted by box office receipts."
3, 47, "Fry", "You're cute!"
3, 47, "Liubot", "You're cute!"
3, 47, "Fry", "You!"
3, 47, "Liubot", "You!"
3, 47, "Fry", "You!"
3, 47, "Liubot", "You!"
3, 47, "Fry", "You!"
3, 47, "Farnsworth", "Oh, dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop and he's an idiot. Well, that's love for you."
3, 47, "Bender", "Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!"
3, 47, "Leela", "Bender, this is Fry's decision ... and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life."
3, 47, "Leela", "She doesn't really love you. She can't. She's just a machine that--"
3, 47, "Bender", "Stay away from our women! You got metal fever, boy! Metal fever!"
3, 47, "Fry", "Well, so what if I love a robot? It's not hurting anybody."
3, 47, "Hermes", "My God! He never took middle school hygiene. He never saw the propaganda film."
3, 47, "Farnsworth", "It's just lucky I keep a copy in the VCR at all times."
3, 47, "Narrator", "Ordinary human dating. It's enjoyable and it serves an important purpose.  But when a human dates an artificial mate, there is no purpose. Only enjoyment. And that leads to ... tragedy."
3, 47, "Billy", "Neat-o! A Marilyn Monroe-bot!"
3, 47, "Monroe-bot", "Ooh! You're a real dreamboat,  Billy Everyteen."
3, 47, "Narrator", "Harmless fun? Let's see what happens next."
3, 47, "Billy's Mom", "Billy, do you want to walk your dog?"
3, 47, "Billy", "No thanks, Mom. I'd rather make out with my Monroe-bot."
3, 47, "Billy's Dad", "Billy, do want to get a paper route and earn some extra cash?"
3, 47, "Billy", "No thanks, Dad. I'd rather make out with my Monroe-bot."
3, 47, "Mavis", "Billy, do you want to come over tonight? We can make out together."
3, 47, "Billy", "Gee, Mavis, your house is across the street. That's an awfully long way to go for making out."
3, 47, "Narrator", "Did you notice what went wrong in that scene? Ordinarily, Billy would work hard to make money from his paper route. Then he'd use the money to buy dinner for Mavis, thus earning the slim chance to perform the reproductive act. But in a world where teens can date robots, why should he bother? Why should anyone bother? Let's take a look at Billy's planet a year later.  Where are all the football stars?  And where are the biochemists?  They're trapped! Trapped in a soft, vice-like grip of robot lips. All civilisation was just an effort to impress the opposite sex ... and sometimes the same sex. Now, let's skip forward 80 years into the future. Where is Billy?"
3, 47, "Billy", "Farewell!"
3, 47, "Narrator", "The next day, Billy's planet was destroyed by aliens.  Have you guessed the name of Billy's planet? It was Earth. Don't date robots!"
3, 47, "Announcer", "Brought to you by the Space Pope."
3, 47, "Leela", "Did that make any impression on you, Fry? Fry?"
3, 47, "Liubot", "Ooh!"
3, 47, "Farnsworth", "I knew I should have shown him Electro Gonorrhoea"
3, 47, "Bender", "What is the world coming to? That Fry's a sicko poivert, I tell you. Dating a robot! It's an atrosmacy!"
3, 47, "Leela", "But Fry's our friend, Bender."
3, 47, "Bender", "Aw, jeez, would you stifle there, meatbag?"
3, 47, "Leela", "You stifle, Bender."
3, 47, "Zoidberg", "Hooray! Finally you're standing up to him."
3, 47, "Leela", "Although he is completely right."
3, 47, "Bender", "We've got to stem this tidal wave of moral decay. It's time to shut down nappster.com!"
3, 47, "Bender", "Who's in charge of this dump?"
3, 47, "Jeff Jervis", "That'd be me. If you're an investor you can dump your money in the hole there."
3, 47, "Bender", "Listen, you fat Internet nerd."
3, 47, "Jeff Jervis", "Listening."
3, 47, "Bender", "Your company promotes wrong love! If you don't shut down right now the only thing wired about you will be your jaw!"
3, 47, "Jeff Jervis", "Y-You can't shut us down. The Internet is about the free exchange and sale of other people's ideas. We've done nothing wrong."
3, 47, "Liu", "Help! I'm being held prisoner!"
3, 47, "Zoidberg", "Someone in trouble is!"
3, 47, "Jeff Jervis", "No, stay out! There's a ... guy going for the Tetris world record in there!"
3, 47, "Kidman", "Who are you?"
3, 47, "Cheech", "Don't hurt us!"
3, 47, "Liu", "Help me! They've been holding me prisoner for 800 years."
3, 47, "Zoidberg", "The real Lucy Liu! The one you can see a movie of in the popcorn stadium."
3, 47, "Bender", "So what's your problem?"
3, 47, "Liu", "Those sweaty nerds are making illegal copies of us.   It hurts!"
3, 47, "Jeff Jervis", "Open this door! Don't make me call the maintenance guy."
3, 47, "Bender", "It's a bluff!"
3, 47, "Leela", "We can't take that chance. Move, people, move!"
3, 47, "Michael", "Please pick me up before you go-go."
3, 47, "Leela", "She asked first."
3, 47, "Nerd", "Um, are you Lucy Liu?"
3, 47, "Albright-bot", "Sure!"
3, 47, "Jeff Jervis", "Oh, we're doomed. They got the head, they uncovered the sign! Soon the whole world will learn we're cyber-criminals. And we would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling adults."
3, 47, "Man", "We'll stop them. They like Lucy Liu, we'll give them all the Lucy Liu they can handle! Hand me that back-up disk."
3, 47, "Zoidberg", "Did you see me escaping? I was all like--"
3, 47, "Liu", "Thanks for rescuing me. Especially you, Bender.  Mmm. Quite a masculine piece of metal, aren't you?"
3, 47, "Bender", "Hey! Don't look at me like that. If you're thinking of crossing the line with Bender, you can forget it. Bender don't bend that way."
3, 47, "Leela", "Hey, look. It's another Lucy Liubot."
3, 47, "Liubot #2", "I am Lucy Liu. Give me your spines."
3, 47, "Zoidberg", "Hey, what the--"
3, 47, "Liubot #2", "Take this and that and one of these."
3, 47, "Liu", "Hey! Cut it out! I don't need this kind of publicity!"
3, 47, "Leela", "Alright, Liu. Time to kick your frosty, well-toned ass! Yah!"
3, 47, "Bender", "Then along came Bender."
3, 47, "Zoidberg", "Looks like you're retaining water."
3, 47, "Liu", "That was incredible, Bender. You're like Jackie Chan before he got all doughy."
3, 47, "Bender", "Oh, shucks! I wasn't afraid of that robot. I'm pretty brave once you get past my macho exterior!  It's an army of Lucy Lius!"
3, 47, "Liu", "They're horrible!"
3, 47, "Liubots", "Take this and that and one of these."
3, 47, "Liubot #3", "Robot crouching tiger."
3, 47, "Liubot #4", "Robot crane style!"
3, 47, "Zapp", "Now that's a wave of destruction that's easy on the eyes!"
3, 47, "Liubot #5", "Hi-yah."
3, 47, "Fry", "This is the best movie I've ever seen. It has a vampire and an explosion!"
3, 47, "Liubot", "It's amazing the way you  notice two things."
3, 47, "Alex", "No, don't open that coffin! It's ticking!"
3, 47, "Natalie", "I have to, Alex. That coffin's not going to open itself."
3, 47, "Vampire", "Bleurh!"
3, 47, "Liu", "Let's hide in here. It'll add to my box office gross."
3, 47, "Leela", "Fry?"
3, 47, "Fry", "Aw, you guys came to watch me make out! That is so sweet.  Wait a minute! Is that the head of who I think it's of?"
3, 47, "Liu", "Read the jar, Evelyn Wood! Dr. Z?"
3, 47, "Leela", "Fry, a herd of Lucy Liu are destroying the city. Is yours acting normally?"
3, 47, "Fry", "Let me see.  Yep. Why do you ask?"
3, 47, "Alex", "Mr. Mayor, if you want to see a real vampire, look in the mirror!"
3, 47, "Mayor", "I can't! I'm a vampire!"
3, 47, "Zoidberg", "Why?"
3, 47, "Leela", "And Nappster says illegal copies never hurt anybody."
3, 47, "Fry", "Quick! This way!"
3, 47, "Fry", "Sorry, ladies. Employees only."
3, 47, "Leela", "Oh, no. They're forming a human pyramid ... of robots."
3, 47, "Bender", "Damnit! We weren't counting on them being as smart as they are sexy!"
3, 47, "Liu", "A dangerous mistake to make."
3, 47, "Zoidberg", "At least we've got food."
3, 47, "Leela", "Dr. Zoidberg, cut open that bag!"
3, 47, "Zoidberg", "Hooray!"
3, 47, "Leela", "And don't eat it."
3, 47, "Liubot #2", "Ow!"
3, 47, "Liubot #3", "System overload!"
3, 47, "Liubot #4", "Error!"
3, 47, "Liubot #5", "Does not compute."
3, 47, "Zoidberg", "Life was bad but now it's good forever!"
3, 47, "Bender", "You'll be safe in here, sweetheart.  Get lost, Pavarotti!"
3, 47, "Fry", "Lucy Liubot, if I don't survive the corn, I want you to know that I love you as much as a man can love a computerised image of gorgeous celebrity. Which it turns out is a lot."
3, 47, "Liubot", "Oh, Fry, I love you more than the moon and the stars and the  poetic image number 37 not found."
3, 47, "Fry", "What are you doing, darling? Get down!"
3, 47, "Liubot #3", "Light hot. Oil temperature rising."
3, 47, "Liubot #4", "Oh, no."
3, 47, "Liubot #5", "Malfunction."
3, 47, "Liubot #6", "This ain't good."
3, 47, "Liubot #7", "System error."
3, 47, "Fry", "You saved us. Are you alright?"
3, 47, "Liubot", "Yes, my love. I'll be just  massive corn clog in port seven."
3, 47, "Liu", "Are you the last copy of me?"
3, 47, "Liubot", "Yes."
3, 47, "Liu", "Erase her, Fry."
3, 47, "Fry", "What? No!"
3, 47, "Liu", "Fry, when you downloaded her without my permission, you stole my image, and in the end that's all I really have. That and the largest gold nugget in the world, one mile in diameter."
3, 47, "Fry", "But I just downloaded her because I love you."
3, 47, "Liu", "If you love the real Lucy Liu and not just what you've seen in movies, genre-straddling lawyer shows and kiss-ass articles in People magazine, you'll blank out that robot."
3, 47, "Fry", "I'm sorry. Hug me, Liubot."
3, 47, "Liubot", "I'll always remember you, Fry--  Memory deleted."
3, 47, "Bender", "I know it hurts, buddy. But at least you're not in a sick relationship with a robot anymore."
3, 47, "Fry", "Uh-huh. And I guess now maybe I can get to know the real Lucy Liu."
3, 47, "Bender", "Pft! Yeah, at our wedding!"
3, 47, "Liu", "It's true. Bender and I are in love."
3, 47, "Fry", "But, but--"
3, 47, "Bender", "Don't be a prude, Fry!"
3, 48, "Leela", "Oh, put down the binoculars, Fry. The wall of that strip club isn't going to collapse twice in one day."
3, 48, "Fry", "I know, and I've grown to accept that. Now I'm more interested in that new pizza parlour across the street. Kinda makes me pine for my days as a pizza delivery boy. ""Here's you pizza,"" I'd say. ""I didn't order any,"" they'd say. And then I'd be off to my next adventure."
3, 48, "Leela", "That story stunk. Hand me the binoculars.  I think the owner is from Cygnus 5."
3, 48, "Farnsworth", "Cygnoids? On our block? Flying foo! They should go back where they came from."
3, 48, "Leela", "Professor, please! Society's never gonna make any progress until we all learn to pretend to like each other. Now let's go over there and make these hideous strangers feel welcome."
3, 48, "Farnsworth", "No!"
3, 48, "Blek", "You sure about these chairs? Guidebook says human legs bend down at knee."
3, 48, "Blek", "It's OK, Mama. Anyone complains, I bend legs up for free.  Ooh! Customers!  Welcome to Earth pizza store. Here, sit. I bend knees for you."
3, 48, "Bender", "Ooh! That's a-comfy!"
3, 48, "Blek", "OK, now, what kind of pizza goes in you?  Silt? Asbestos? We got guano -- very fresh!"
3, 48, "Fry", "Uh ... hmm ... do you have any food?"
3, 48, "Blek", "Here, try a deep dish pizza.  Contains four kind of things."
3, 48, "Leela", "I don't mean to offend, but this tastes like vomit."
3, 48, "Cygnoid Woman", "Thank you."
3, 48, "Leela", "No, actually, I did mean to offend a little. This is awful."
3, 48, "Fry", "Hey, hey. What's wrong? Was it something Leela said?"
3, 48, "Cygnoid Woman", "We come to Earth to start new life. Raise fat spoiled Earth kids, hang many underwear from Earth clothesline, live Earthican dream."
3, 48, "Fry", "Aw. Don't cry, foreign people. I used to work in a pizzeria and as soon as I stop hallucinating and blasting puke, I'm gonna teach you to sell pizza, Earth style!"
3, 48, "Cygnoid Woman", "Oh, thank you, magic biped!"
3, 48, "Blek", "You save us, a-sir. If we cannot make Earth pizza our dream will die. Just like rats we crushed to make the wine."
3, 48, "Fry", "For starters, only use quality ingredients. Case in point"
3, 48, "Cygnoid #2", "Hey, ocupado!"
3, 48, "Fry", "Most important of all is the big screen TV. Human families need a TV when they're eating so they don't have to talk to each other.  Ah, the Earthican pastime"
3, 48, "Uecker", "Mulligan drives the ball. It's going, going and caught by the shortstop. Mets lose again. Man, I haven't seen play this bad since the days of Bob Uecker! This is Bob Uecker saying thanks for watching!"
3, 48, "Blek", "Mets? Shortstop? Pinching the hitter? I don't understand this ""blernsball""."
3, 48, "Fry", "Well, if you're going to be Earthicans, we'll have to teach you. How about your pizzeria plays a game against Planet Express? Oh, but you'll need nine players."
3, 48, "Cygnoid Woman", "No problem!"
3, 48, "Cygnoid #2", "Play the ball!"
3, 48, "Farnsworth", "Go, team! Beat those no good Cygnoids! Show them they stink at a game they've never played before!"
3, 48, "Blek", "Ah, this is why I love Earth! Beautiful star-brightened day, friendly blernsball game with chum pals! So pleasant for everybody."
3, 48, "Scruffy", "Hit by a pitch. Take your base."
3, 48, "Leela", "Sorry about that. I guess I needed a few more warm-up pitches."
3, 48, "Bender", "No batter! No batter!  No batter anymore."
3, 48, "Scruffy", "Take your base."
3, 48, "Leela", "I didn't mean to hit you. I have some trouble with depth perception."
3, 48, "Cygnoid #2", "Yeah, me too now."
3, 48, "Bender", "Hey, batter, batter, batter! Hey, batter, batter, batter! Hey, batter, batter!  Duck!"
3, 48, "Scruffy", "Take your base."
3, 48, "Cygnoid #3", "Please, lady, I want to live. Can I use bat to protect head?"
3, 48, "Bender", "Apparently not."
3, 48, "Man", "Check out the one-eyed bean machine!"
3, 48, "Blek", "Hooray! I make a score point!"
3, 48, "Fry", "Leela, you beaned a run-in. You'd better let me pitch."
3, 48, "Leela", "But I've got a no-hitter going.  You're right. Here."
3, 48, "Randy", "Don't take her out, she's a firecracker!"
3, 48, "Doubledeal", "Excuse me, I'd like to talk to you."
3, 48, "Leela", "Am I under arrest?"
3, 48, "Bender", "Wait! I know you. You're the sleazebag who owns the Ultimate Robot Fighting League."
3, 48, "Doubledeal", "Not anymore. Now I'm the sleazebag who owns the New New York Mets."
3, 48, "Leela", "The Mets? Those bums are worse than me."
3, 48, "Doubledeal", "Close to it. But they don't draw a crowd like you. Which is why I wanna sign you to the team."
3, 48, "Leela", "You mean I'd be the first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball?"
3, 48, "Commissioner", "Well, yeah, but basically you'd just be a publicity stunt. I figure a one-eyed lady skull-buster might bring out the freakshow crowd."
3, 48, "Leela", "Wow! The first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball."
3, 48, "Commissioner", "Again, yeah, but basically you'd just be--"
3, 48, "Leela", "Ta-da! The first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball. How do I look?"
3, 48, "Hermes", "Like a sexy Yogi Berra!"
3, 48, "Farnsworth", "Why is your number seven-eighth's?"
3, 48, "Leela", "All the whole numbers have been retired."
3, 48, "Fry", "Wow! I must say, I'm impressed. You look just like a ball player. Can I pat you on the butt?"
3, 48, "Leela", "Fry, I'm a professional athlete! So go ahead."
3, 48, "Fry", "Oh! Now I'm too nervous."
3, 48, "Uecker", "Well, folks, it's only the fifth inning but the Swedes have already turned this one into a ""laffer"". And that's with two F's. The crowd is pouring out of the stadium L.A.-style."
3, 48, "Doubledeal", "Skipper, we're losing the crowd. Put it our new novelty act"
3, 48, "Skipper", "Darn it! I already put in the circus clown."
3, 48, "Doubledeal", "Yeah, but he bunted. Clowns are only funny when they swing away."
3, 48, "Announcer", "Your attention, please. Now pitching for the Mets"
3, 48, "Woman", "Come on! Throw like a girl!"
3, 48, "Fry", "Go, Leela!"
3, 48, "Bender", "Come on, girl!"
3, 48, "Amy", "Too much eyeliner!"
3, 48, "Uecker", "This is history in the making, folks. Bjornson steps up to the plate and Leela delivers."
3, 48, "Bender", "Bullseye!"
3, 48, "Uecker", "Ooh! An inauspicious start for the career of the first woman blernsballer.  An inauspicious continuation for the career of the first woman blernsballer."
3, 48, "Crowd", "Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean!"
3, 48, "Uecker", "Ouch! It's a three-bean-ball salad. The Mets fans love it though, and who can blame them? They haven't had much to cheer about this year--"
3, 48, "Doubledeal", "Kid, that was great! You got us more publicity than a cowboy in a shark tank. Poor Tex, he was quite a shark."
3, 48, "Man #1", "Hey!"
3, 48, "Man #2", "Hey!"
3, 48, "Man #3", "Come on!"
3, 48, "Man #4", "I win!"
3, 48, "Bender", "Oop! Sorry."
3, 48, "Leela", "Bender, how did you get in here?"
3, 48, "Bender", "As your agent, I have access to you at all times."
3, 48, "Leela", "Since when are you my agent?"
3, 48, "Bender", "Quiet, call coming in.  Yes? A big endorsement deal for Leela? How much? Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass! Deal!"
3, 48, "Leela", "Bender, that's great! How much did you get me?"
3, 48, "Bender", "One hundred dollars."
3, 48, "Leela", "As a pitcher, I serve up plenty of bean balls. So I know good beans when I see them. Bean-Bay Beans"
3, 48, "Director #1", "Cut!"
3, 48, "Uecker", "In very short order, Leela has become a fan favourite."
3, 48, "Bender", "You're the best, babe!  Hang on. Call comin' in.  What's that? Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass! Deal!"
3, 48, "Leela", "So what did you get me?"
3, 48, "Bender", "A thousand and one pesos!"
3, 48, "Leela", "Yo soy muy malo en lanzar, pero yo soy muy bueno en comer frijoles. Come los Bean Bay frijoles, los frijoles de los reyes."
3, 48, "Director #2", "Cut! OK, now do one with bean suit on!"
3, 48, "Blek", "Leela really bringing in the customers."
3, 48, "Cygnoid Woman", "This keep up, we need to buy second sauce toilet."
3, 48, "Girl", "When I grow up I want to injure men by throwing stuff at them just like you, Leela. Will you sign my magazine?"
3, 48, "Leela", "Aw! Sure thing, sweetie. Who should I make it out to?"
3, 48, "Girl", "Well, uh ... to eBay?"
3, 48, "Leela", "That's a popular name today. Little ""e"" big ""B""?"
3, 48, "Bender", "Five bucks an autograph, 200 fans. Add a one and two zeros in front of that and we got ourselves a wad!"
3, 48, "Leela", "I'm not doing this for the wad. I'm doing it for all the struggling female athletes who need a role model."
3, 48, "Woman", "Yeah! A role model for how to stink!"
3, 48, "Leela", "What? Who are you?"
3, 48, "Woman", "Jackie Anderson. I'm on the blernsball team at NNYU and I was hoping to get to play in the majors soon."
3, 48, "Leela", "Oh, following in my footsteps?"
3, 48, "Jackie", "Pft. God forbid! Your little freakshow is making it impossible for real female ball players to be taken seriously. I hope you're proud of yourself."
3, 48, "Bender", "Alright, show's over. No refunds. You heard the robot. Get out!"
3, 48, "Leela", "I'm a fool. The fans haven't been cheering for me, they've been cheering at me."
3, 48, "Amy", "Don't be upset, Leela. You, um ... you look really cute in your uniform."
3, 48, "Leela", "That's what makes it so sad. I thought I was doing something heroic."
3, 48, "Bender", "You are. What about that little girl you visited in the hospital? You know the one I mean? The one who died?"
3, 48, "Leela", "You're right. I can't let people down anymore. As God as my witness, I vow to earn the respect of girls and women everywhere. I will become the best blernsball player of all time."
3, 48, "Hermes", "That's statistically impossible. In 77 innings you haven't gotten a single out. At this rate, you're sure to go down as the worst blernsball player of all time."
3, 48, "Leela", "Oh. Then I have a new vow. I solemnly swear that I will become not the worst blernsball player of all time."
3, 48, "Fry", "Hey, look! The players who broke the various colour barriers."
3, 48, "Bender", "When will Man learn that all races are equally inferior to robots?"
3, 48, "Leela", "Ah, here we are. The worst player in history. If I can be just a little better than him I can slink away with my head held high."
3, 48, "Bender", "It says he once struck out when his tongue got stuck to an unusually cold bat."
3, 48, "Fry", "And here he is trying to make a catch with an oven mitt."
3, 48, "Leela", "It's even a crummy hologram."
3, 48, "Aaron Jr.", "I'm not a hologram, though I am crummy.  Hank Aaron XXIV."
3, 48, "Fry", "Hank Aaron XXIV? How could you play so blowfully? The original Hank Aaron was great!"
3, 48, "Aaron Sr.", "No, I was better than great. I was the home run king!"
3, 48, "Bender", "Neat!"
3, 48, "Leela", "So, Hank-- The bad Hank. Just how blowful were you?"
3, 48, "Aaron Jr.", "Well, I had a low batting average."
3, 48, "Aaron Sr.", "Low? It was zero, you fungo! You went your whole career without getting a hit."
3, 48, "Fry", "Leela could beat that. She's pitched her whole career without getting an out."
3, 48, "Aaron Sr.", "You stink, lady! Hey, Junior, she belongs in the exhibit instead of you."
3, 48, "Aaron Jr.", "Forget it. This job's too cushy to give up.  Ah, Wade Boggs! Goes down smooth!"
3, 48, "Leela", "Look, I don't wanna be in this exhibit. That's why I need your help. So I can be one tiny iota less pathetic than you."
3, 48, "Aaron Jr.", "Oh, I can't help you play better than Tiny Iota. That guy was great. But I'll teach you everything I know."
3, 48, "Aaron Jr.", "OK, let's see what you can do."
3, 48, "Bender", "One thing she can do is lodge a ball in the depth centre of your brain. You better get a batting helmet."
3, 48, "Leela", "Alright. Low and away."
3, 48, "Aaron Jr.", "OK, try it again. But this time keep your eye off the ball."
3, 48, "Leela", "You mean ""keep your eye on the ball""?"
3, 48, "Aaron Jr.", "Hey, lady, which one of us is in the hall of fame?"
3, 48, "Fry", "Pst. You're holding the bat upside down."
3, 48, "Aaron Jr.", "Just pitch the ball."
3, 48, "Leela", "OK. Eye off the ball."
3, 48, "Bender", "Strike!"
3, 48, "Fry", "Hooray!"
3, 48, "Aaron Jr.", "You did it, Leela!"
3, 48, "Leela", "I didn't hit the batter! For once I was pitching and not just belly-itching!"
3, 48, "Aaron Jr.", "Oh, you got that too? I think there's a rash goin' around."
3, 48, "Uecker", "Welcome to Fenway Park, home of the Boston Poindexters, where the Mets close out a season that'll rank among Mankind's most awful crimes."
3, 48, "Fry", "Hey! You opened a franchise!"
3, 48, "Cygnoid Woman", "Yes. Our biggest seller is Leela's Bean Pizza. Six kinds of beans, plus several things that look like beans."
3, 48, "Gilman", "Beans, huh? Mmm. This is great! How to you make the crust so fizzy?"
3, 48, "Blek", "Ah-ah-ah! Ancient Cygnoid secret!"
3, 48, "Cygnoid Woman", "My husband, some hotshot! Here's his ancient Cygnoid secret!  Live hornets! We smush them right into dough!"
3, 48, "Gilman", "I don't care if there's horse manure in it!"
3, 48, "Blek", "That's a-good!"
3, 48, "Gilman", "I wanna buy this franchise. How does $100,000 sound?"
3, 48, "Blek", "Forget it! We come to Earth to make pizza, not money."
3, 48, "Cygnoid Woman", "No, Blek! Other way around!"
3, 48, "Blek", "Oh, right. Offer accepted!"
3, 48, "Uecker", "Well, fans, Boston's turning the last game into a real ""squeeeker""! And that's with three ""e's""! Two men on and they're down to their last out."
3, 48, "Leela", "Come on, skipper. It's my last chance to prove I'm not the worst player ever. Please put me in."
3, 48, "Skipper", "No. We're actually winning this game. You only go in as a joke when we're eight runs behind. Or when our other pitchers sneak out early to beat the traffic.   Come on! Let's see some fundamentals out there!  And not clown fundamentals.  Aw, darn, darn darn! Now the bases are loaded! Isn't there a man on this team who can get one more out?"
3, 48, "Leela", "I can."
3, 48, "Skipper", "I repeat"
3, 48, "Leela", "I've been training with Hank Aaron."
3, 48, "Skipper", "You've been training with the Hank Aaron?"
3, 48, "Leela", "I've been training with a Hank Aaron."
3, 48, "Skipper", "Alright then. Get in there and pitch like you've never pitched like you before!"
3, 48, "Announcer", "Now pitching for the Mets"
3, 48, "Crowd", "Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean!  Go, Leela!"
3, 48, "Farnsworth", "Go, Leela!"
3, 48, "Amy", "Come on, Leela!"
3, 48, "Bender", "Put it right down the pike!"
3, 48, "Fry", "Strike him out, Leela! Do it for the hundreds of women everywhere!"
3, 48, "Announcer", "Your attention"
3, 48, "Uecker", "Would you look at that! College blernsball's finest female hitter making her big league debut against pro-ball's worst female anything. I've never seen anything this bizarre, and I've seen Mr. Belvedere naked! Woo!"
3, 48, "Leela", "Keep cool. She's just like any other player. She puts on her sports bra one arm at a time."
3, 48, "Umpire", "Strike one!"
3, 48, "Leela", "Strike one, a personal best!"
3, 48, "Umpire", "Strike two!"
3, 48, "Uecker", "Remember, fans, this exciting moment is brought to you by Month Old Franks, the hotdogs with experience! Mmm-mmm!  A grand slam blern. The Mets lose! Their season is over! And no question, Leela, the first woman ever to reach the Majors, will go down as the single worst player in the history of blernsball!  And yet tonight we have witnessed the beginning of a great career for the first woman to play the sport well -- Jackie Anderson!"
3, 48, "Jackie", "Leela?"
3, 48, "Leela", "Jackie. I guess you were right. I'm a lousy role model. I'm sorry."
3, 48, "Jackie", "No, don't be. It turns out you were an inspiration after all."
3, 48, "Leela", "I was?"
3, 48, "Jackie", "Uh-huh. You were so awful that women everywhere set out to prove they don't stink as bad as you. You know, like a pig or something."
3, 48, "Leela", "Oh, that's so kind of you. I guess I made a difference after all."
3, 48, "Jackie", "You absolutely did, Leela. Now please, please retire. Immediately."
3, 48, "Leela", "Hey, kid. Catch!"
3, 48, "Aaron Sr.", "Well, at least you're still the worst football player of all time."
3, 48, "Aaron Jr.", "Yeah. Yeah."
3, 49, "Linda", "Up next, daring daylight robbery at a municipal swimming pool."
3, 49, "Bender", "Ooh! This is it! Turn me up!"
3, 49, "Linda", "Earlier today, a foul-mouthed bandit robbed the municipal pool, making off with the contents of over three lockers."
3, 49, "Bender", "More like three lockers and a sink!"
3, 49, "Leela", "Bender? Did you have something to do with this?"
3, 49, "Bender", "Of course not."
3, 49, "Hermes", "Holy spitz! He's sportin' skintight Speedos!"
3, 49, "Amy", "They don't leave much to the imagination."
3, 49, "Hermes", "Actually, on a robot, they sorta do."
3, 49, "Morbo", "One puny human got a look at the robber..."
3, 49, "Bender", "Here we go. Here we go!"
3, 49, "Morbo", "Describing him as a short, nasty, muscular..."
3, 49, "Bender", "Yeah, make me famous, big head!"
3, 49, "Morbo", "Caucasian human male."
3, 49, "Bender", "What?"
3, 49, "Fry", "Hey! Now what am I supposed to watch and drink all day?"
3, 49, "Bender", "This is an outrage. What's the point of pulling the biggest pool caper ever if nobody knows you did it?"
3, 49, "Fry", "Well, there's the material rewards."
3, 49, "Bender", "You mean this junk?"
3, 49, "Boy", "Whee!"
3, 49, "Bender", "All I ever wanted was for people to remember my name.  It's Bender."
3, 49, "Farnsworth", "Oh, fuff! Why bother remembering anything? You're just going to forget it five seconds later."
3, 49, "Bender", "It's so unfair. A debonair robot with a zesty in-your-face outlook doomed to obscurity like the rest of you, especially Leela. If I died tomorrow, no one would even notice."
3, 49, "Scruffy", "Boy, I've never seen him so down, or ever before."
3, 49, "Bender", "How does a nobody like me get famous?  I know!  Hey, look! I'm stuck! But I haven't given up hope! Call a soft-news journalist!"
3, 49, "Woman", "You're not stuck."
3, 49, "Bender", "Shut up."
3, 49, "Bender", "Hey, everyone do The Bender! This move's called The Bender!"
3, 49, "Roller-Skater", "Yo, hotwheels. This circle's about free expression, not fascist moves!"
3, 49, "Bender", "A blank wall! Fame is mine!"
3, 49, "Bender", "There. Now no one will forget how I lived or my attitude regarding butt."
3, 49, "Sal", "Alrights, ladies, let's flush these artists lofts straights to hell!"
3, 49, "Bender", "No!"
3, 49, "Bender", "I'm the first one to work. A new low."
3, 49, "All", "Surprise!"
3, 49, "Fry", "Happy funeral, Bender!"
3, 49, "Bender", "A surprise funeral? For me?"
3, 49, "Fry", "We just wanted to show you that you really will be remembered."
3, 49, "Zoidberg", "Now if the deceased would kindly take his place of honour."
3, 49, "Bender", "Ooh! Cushion-y! And a minibar!"
3, 49, "Fry", "Dearly beloved, we are here today to remember Bender, taken from us in the prime of life when he was crushed by a runaway semi driven by the Incredible Hulk."
3, 49, "Bender", "Aw! You knew my favourite cause of death."
3, 49, "Fry", "Now let us each remember the best things about Bender in our own way. Professor?"
3, 49, "Farnsworth", "Your standard bending unit is made of an iron-osmium alloy. But Bender was different. Bender had a point-04% nickel impurity."
3, 49, "Bender", "It's what made me me."
3, 49, "Hermes", "If you ever needed a small package brought into the country without a lot of X-raying and such, Bender always had a free body cavity."
3, 49, "Bender", "Eh, the Professor's was better."
3, 49, "Leela", "Bender, shush. You're supposed to be dead."
3, 49, "Bender", "Say more about how great I am. And where's the crying? You people look like you're waiting for the bus."
3, 49, "Zoidberg", "Oh, Danny-boy,The pipes, the pipes are calling--"
3, 49, "Bender", "Who-y-boy?"
3, 49, "Zoidberg", "From glen to glen and down--"
3, 49, "Bender", "Danny-boy? You're at my funeral, singing about some dead stiff named Danny-boy? You really are a massive bonehead."
3, 49, "Zoidberg", "I'm expressing my sorrow."
3, 49, "Bender", "Get lost! I'd say ""Don't quit your day job"" but you're awful at that too."
3, 49, "Leela", "We're trying our best."
3, 49, "Bender", "Your best is an idiot. Let's pick it up, people. So far it's been crap after crap! I croaked, now show me some love!"
3, 49, "Amy", "Bender was a truly special--"
3, 49, "Bender", "Louder and sadder."
3, 49, "Amy", "Bender was a truly special--"
3, 49, "Bender", "Next!"
3, 49, "Preacherbot", "Dear Lord--"
3, 49, "Bender", "Oh, next!"
3, 49, "Zoidberg", "Oh, Danny-boy--"
3, 49, "Bender", "Come on! Surely there must be someone here who knows how great I was."
3, 49, "Fry", "Yes there is, Bender. Bender was a lot of things to a lot of people. But, looking back, the number one thing I can say about him is this, and simply this"
3, 49, "Bender", "What? That's it? Who are you? You're nobody! This is the worst funeral ever!  I hope you're all happy. You've succeeded in convincing me life is worth living, by showing how bad my funeral will suck."
3, 49, "Amy", "I know whose funeral we'll be attending next!"
3, 49, "Farnsworth", "Oh, stop!"
3, 49, "Farnsworth", "News, everyone! Today you're going to Osiris 4 to deliver this enormous sandstone block."
3, 49, "Fry", "I thought something looked different in here."
3, 49, "Fry", "Hi. We have a giant stone to deliver. Sign here."
3, 49, "Osiran", "Ah, very nice. Much like the 10 million identical stones used in the future tomb of our great Pharaoh Hermenthotip."
3, 49, "Leela", "Impressive. Who's building it?"
3, 49, "Osiran", "You."
3, 49, "Leela", "Say again?"
3, 49, "Osiran", "You are now slaves of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip. Guards."
3, 49, "Fry", "Call it a hunch but I've got a bad feeling about this."
3, 49, "Fry", "You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work but they don't pay you or let you go."
3, 49, "Leela", "That's the only thing about being a slave!"
3, 49, "Osiran", "Attention. You are now possessions of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip, heir to the Tenth Dynasty, bringer of the good aspects of the annual floods."
3, 49, "Fry", "Incredible. This place is just like the Ancient Egypt of my day."
3, 49, "Osiran", "That is no coincidence. For our people visited your Egypt thousands of years ago."
3, 49, "Fry", "I knew it! Insane theories, one; regular theories, a billion."
3, 49, "Osiran", "We learned many things from the mighty Egyptians, such as pyramid-building, space travel and how to prepare our dead so as to scare Abbott and Costello."
3, 49, "Fry", "Also Wolfman!"
3, 49, "Bender", "Look at these swanky tombs! These people really know how to die."
3, 49, "Leela", "Are you crazy? They worked thousands of people to death to make these stupid monuments."
3, 49, "Bender", "Hey, you spend your whole life building a guy's toe and you're gonna remember him.  I think I'm gonna like it here!"
3, 49, "Man #1", "Yeah, I, uh, noticed your sign and I thought I'd come over here and look into getting involved in your program."
3, 49, "Man #2", "What we do is make you starve to death."
3, 49, "Osiran", "One, two, three, pull!  One, two, three, pull!"
3, 49, "Australian Man", "Oh! Bloody chunder!"
3, 49, "Bender", "Pick it up, people. We're enslaved here to do a job. Master? Do we have to count to three every time? Couldn't we just count to one. Or better yet one-half?"
3, 49, "Osiran", "Good idea, slave.  One-half, pull!  One-half, pull!"
3, 49, "Bender", "Now we're slavin'!"
3, 49, "Bender", "Come on, guys. Pharaoh's countin' on us. Work faster, like this.  You call that motivating me? Don't just whip with your arms. The power comes from your hips. Like this."
3, 49, "Leela", "Bender, quit giving the slave drivers pointers!"
3, 49, "Fry", "Yeah. Remember who your real friends are."
3, 49, "Bender", "I'll tell you who I remember.  Anopsis ... Pleotut ... Whatshisname. He was the greatest of all."
3, 49, "Osiran", "Pharaoh Hermenthotip approaches."
3, 49, "Bender", "Hurry! Hurry! Pharaoh's coming! Get that nose in place. Come on!"
3, 49, "Hermenthotip", "Excellent work! I am very proud of all you slaves."
3, 49, "Bender", "Viva Hermenthotip!"
3, 49, "Hermenthotip", "And now, I have a grand announcement. In honour of your achievement, you're all hereby--"
3, 49, "Bender", "No!"
3, 49, "Hermenthotip", "Tell the slaves they can all go--"
3, 49, "Bender", "Go faster? I told them but they're so damn lazy."
3, 49, "Hermenthotip", "No. I mean they are all free--"
3, 49, "Bender", "Free-loading off you? I agree."
3, 49, "Hermenthotip", "No, I--"
3, 49, "Osiran", "Pharaoh Hermenthotip is dead."
3, 49, "Bender", "He's whippin' angels now."
3, 49, "High Priest", "We commend the body of Hermenthotip to the abode of the damned. The damned good looking!  Pharaoh commanded me to tell that joke at his funeral."
3, 49, "Bender", "I'll always remember you, Hermenthotip!"
3, 49, "High Priest", "To equip Pharaoh for his journey, we bury him with his favourite possessions. Such as his heart and liver.  And the many goods he left in his royal garage.  Also, this bag of cats our culture considers holy."
3, 49, "Singer", "Pharaoh my God-king,You are cold and deceased,I used to have him sing..."
3, 49, "Singer", "P-P-P-Pharaoh and his pets..."
3, 49, "Singer", "But the years went by,And Pharaoh died,Suzie will have joined him in the afterlife--"
3, 49, "Osiran", "Hermenthotip is gone. The time to designate a new Pharaoh is at hand."
3, 49, "Bender", "Wow!"
3, 49, "Osiran", "At dawn tomorrow, the high priest will consult the Wall of Prophecy to determine Hermenthotip's successor.  That concludes the funeral. You don't have to go home but you can't stay here."
3, 49, "Fry", "Can you believe it? Pharaoh's dead!"
3, 49, "Slave #1", "Yes! Tonight we are slaves to no one, except the rhythm!"
3, 49, "Leela", "Yeah! Play those bongos!"
3, 49, "Fry", "I'm gonna spin till I fall down!"
3, 49, "Bender", "We interrupt this ancient prophecy to bring you late-breaking bulletin. He hammers the back of his head and creates and imprint of himself on the wall."
3, 49, "High Priest", "Great Wall of Prophecy, reveal to us God's will that we may blindly obey."
3, 49, "Priests", "Free us from thought and responsibility."
3, 49, "High Priest", "We shall read things off you."
3, 49, "Priests", "Then do them."
3, 49, "High Priest", "Your words guide us."
3, 49, "Priests", "We're dumb."
3, 49, "Fry", "You know what else stinks about being a slave? The hours."
3, 49, "High Priest", "The prophecy is strange and crudely drawn at best. It indicates that, we are ""here"" and our next Pharaoh is over there, near some ... tents."
3, 49, "Bender", "Those are waves, jackass. It's supposed to be a river!"
3, 49, "Fry", "Hey. I think I know who the next Pharaoh is!"
3, 49, "Leela", "Oh, Lord!"
3, 49, "High Priest", "We hear your voice, oh, great Pharaoh. Reveal yourself to us."
3, 49, "Bender", "Behold! I have emerged from the place of spells and fairies!"
3, 49, "High Priest", "It is he. Just as the Wall of Prophecy prophesied.  Long live Pharaoh Bender!"
3, 49, "Slaves", "Long live Pharaoh Bender!"
3, 49, "Leela", "This society is a bunch of idiots."
3, 49, "High Priest", "People of Osiris 4, please welcome a man who started as a slave but worked his way up to Lord of All Creation! Our new Pharaoh, Bender!"
3, 49, "Bender", "Citizens of Me! The cruelty of the old Pharaoh is a thing of the past.  Let a whole new wave of cruelty wash over this lazy land."
3, 49, "Leela", "What did he say?"
3, 49, "Bender", "Hear the word of Pharaoh. Build unto me a statue of ridiculous proportion. One billion cubits in height ...  ... that I might be remember-ed for all eternity. And be quick about it!"
3, 49, "Bender", "Lowly slave, why are you not working?"
3, 49, "Slave #2", "I am."
3, 49, "Bender", "I meant yourself to death."
3, 49, "Slave #3", "Mighty Pharaoh, it hurts when I breathe."
3, 49, "Bender", "Well then what do you think you should stop doing?  Crawl, pigs!"
3, 49, "Leela", "Ow!"
3, 49, "Bender", "The Pharaoh has spoken."
3, 49, "Bender", "Your task is nearly completed. Don't let down Pharaoh now."
3, 49, "Osiran", "The great monument is finished, oh Pharaoh. And now, the unveiling."
3, 49, "Statue", "Remember me.  Remember me.  Remember me."
3, 49, "Osiran", "Does it please you, my lord?"
3, 49, "Bender", "Hmm ... it's a good start. Uh, yeah, it's definitely big alright. I just wonder if it's too big, y'know? I mean, are people gonna be remembering me or the statue?"
3, 49, "High Priest", "But, sire, we made it to your exact specifications."
3, 49, "Bender", "Too exact if you ask me. Tear it down and try again. But this time don't embarrass yourselves."
3, 49, "High Priest", "Ladies and gentlemen, the Pharaoh suddenly died."
3, 49, "Leela", "Good riddance."
3, 49, "Bender", "What about my servants?"
3, 49, "Priest", "Oh, yeah."
3, 49, "Fry", "Bender, I really hope that's you. 'Cause if it isn't ... we're in trouble!"
3, 49, "Leela", "You jerk. Why'd you have to drag us along?"
3, 49, "Bender", "I wanted to watch you remember me."
3, 49, "Leela", "Did you really think you'd need all this junk in the afterlife?"
3, 49, "Bender", "Afterlife? Pft. If I thought I had to go through a whole other life I'd kill myself right now."
3, 49, "Leela", "Well rot in peace. Fry and I are leaving."
3, 49, "Bender", "Sorry, but we're totally sealed in.  Nothing can get in or out. Except millions of snakes.  Here, have a pomegranate schnapps from my private distillery and start sharing fond memories of me, Bender."
3, 49, "Fry", "What proof is this? Some huge number?"
3, 49, "Leela", "It's explosive! Maybe we could escape by setting fire to the distillery and blowing this whole place to rubble!  Let's get a little kindling going!"
3, 49, "Bender", "No! You can't blow up my monument. I won't be remembered."
3, 49, "Leela", "Oh, right, how selfish of me. We'll just stay here forever. Hey, Fry? Remember that robot ""Bender""?"
3, 49, "Fry", "Bend-er? Doesn't ring a bell.  Did you hear something, Leela?"
3, 49, "Leela", "No. But I bet it wasn't someone who was good at stealing."
3, 49, "Bender", "Stop it, stop it! It's not right! You've crossed a line."
3, 49, "Fry", "Hey, Leela, you know who I remember?"
3, 49, "Bender", "Oh, please, let it be me."
3, 49, "Fry", "That guy who used to bend things. You know?"
3, 49, "Bender", "Me, please!"
3, 49, "Fry", "Hermes."
3, 49, "Bender", "Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, blow up my statue."
3, 49, "Leela", "Oh, Bender! When did you come in? Hold still!"
3, 49, "Leela", "Let's blow this tomb!"
3, 49, "Slave #1", "Pharaoh Bender! He once more walks among the living."
3, 49, "Bender", "How we doing?"
3, 49, "Statue", "Remember me."
3, 49, "Bender", "I will. I will."
3, 49, "Bender", "Please, just leave me alone."
3, 49, "Leela", "Bender, I understand your desire to be remembered. But you don't need a statue for that."
3, 49, "Bender", "I don't?"
3, 49, "Leela", "No. You have your legacy as a brutal, tyrannical dictator, and that will outlive any monument."
3, 49, "Bender", "You really think they'll remember me?"
3, 49, "Fry", "Absolutely."
3, 49, "Bender", "Well in that case. One planet down! Helmsman..."
3, 49, "Bender", "Set course for Earth!"
3, 49, "Leela", "That's not Earth."
3, 49, "Bender", "Oh."
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "There. I've finished fine-tuning my What-If machine. It can answer any ""What-If"" question, accurate to within one-tenth of a plausibility unit."
3, 50, "Leela", "That's so plausible I can't believe it!"
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "Who wants the machine to show them an alternate reality?"
3, 50, "Bender", "Ooh! Ooh! I wanna know what would happen if I were human. I mean, being a robot's great, but we don't have emotions and sometimes that makes me very sad."
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "Oh, Lordy Lou, there he goes again. Well, let's give baby what he wants.  What if Bender were human?"
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "Good news, everyone! I've invented a way to turn Bender into a human using a process I call ""reverse fossilisation""."
3, 50, "Leela", "How does it work?"
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "Well, in regular fossilisation, flesh and bone turn to minerals. Realising that, it was a simple matter to reverse the process. I've already tested it by turning the toaster into a racoon."
3, 50, "Fry", "Kinda game-y."
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "Are you ready, Bender?"
3, 50, "Bender", "I dunno. I'm beginning to have some second thoughts--"
3, 50, "Hermes", "Cover your shame, mon!"
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "It worked! Eat it, everyone whose never won a Nobel Prize! And that includes you, Amy!"
3, 50, "Bender", "So this is a human body, huh? Neat!  Hey, my antenna's gone.  No, it just moved. I'm not getting good reception on it though. Maybe if I wiggle it around a little."
3, 50, "Fry", "Bender, no! You'll make God cry."
3, 50, "Bender", "Well, let's see what kinda things this body can do.  Hey, that's pretty fun.  Being human is great!"
3, 50, "Zoidberg", "Hooray! It's just like Mardis Gras!"
3, 50, "Bender", "Guy! Guys! You've gotta see this. You're not gonna believe it!"
3, 50, "Leela", "Bender, it's OK to be proud but don't be a show-off."
3, 50, "Bender", "Whoa! You look a lot better than you used to for some reason."
3, 50, "Amy", "You're not so bad yourself, big boy."
3, 50, "Bender", "Hey, that felt great!  Nah, it's not working anymore."
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "Speak for yourself!"
3, 50, "Bender", "Whoa! This is awesome!"
3, 50, "Leela", "Bender, you drank and smoked when you were a robot."
3, 50, "Bender", "But now it's bad for me!"
3, 50, "Fry", "Speaking of which, try these nachos."
3, 50, "Bender", "Mmm! Why didn't anyone tell me tasting things tasted so good?  What's going on? That rhythm! It's doing something to my human butt."
3, 50, "Amy", "Bender, part of being human is having self control."
3, 50, "Bender", "Oh, my God! I bet I can eat nachos and go to the bathroom at the same time!"
3, 50, "Amy", "No, Bender!"
3, 50, "Hermes", "No!"
3, 50, "Leela", "Stop him."
3, 50, "Bender", "Let me go."
3, 50, "Leela", "No!"
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "Come, Bender. It's time to go home and rest. I need you in top shape next week when I present you to the Nobel Prize Committee. Bender?"
3, 50, "Bender", "Goodbye, moderation!"
3, 50, "Zoidberg", "Is Bender still missing for a week? Where is he, already?"
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "Uh, as I've said before, I used reverse fossilisation, which is the reverse of regular, um..."
3, 50, "Fry", "Pst! We found him!"
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "Ah! Then without further stalling for time, I present to the Nobel judges the first robot ever turned into a human."
3, 50, "Wernstrom", "My God! He needs medical attention!"
3, 50, "Zoidberg", "Pulse, 300; liver, failing; cholesterol, 40?"
3, 50, "Leela", "Well, that's not so bad."
3, 50, "Zoidberg", "No, I mean 40 pounds!"
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "This, um, scientific breakthrough ... heralds a new dawn in human-robot relations, yes."
3, 50, "Bender", "C'mere and give old Bender a kiss.  Hey, you like grilled cheese?"
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "And, um, that's why I believe I deserve the Nobel Prize."
3, 50, "Wernstrom", "Not only do you not deserve a Nobel Prize for loosing this bloated man-ball on the world but you are hereby kicked out of the Academy of Science."
3, 50, "Bender", "Wait! As men of science are not your minds open to new ideas? I say, do not judge me until you have tried my way of life for yourselves."
3, 50, "Wernstrom", "Young man, you have opened our minds and swayed our hearts. Let us therefore--"
3, 50, "Bender", "Party!"
3, 50, "Wernstrom", "Bender, you were right! Truly you have lived more in your one week of being human than the rest of us have in our entire lives."
3, 50, "Bender", "Woo!"
3, 50, "Wernstrom", "And so, to recognise your achievements, I hereby award you the Nobel Prize ...  ... in, uh ...  ... Chemistry."
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "Care to say a few words, Bender?"
3, 50, "Fry", "He's dead."
3, 50, "Wernstrom", "When did he die?"
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "About 12 hours ago when the party started."
3, 50, "Wernstrom", "But he just said, ""Woo."""
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "No, that was air escaping from the folds of his fat.  Goodnight, sweet prince. You were the greatest man any of us will ever know. Well, let's get him out of here. He's starting to smell up the joint."
3, 50, "Narrator", "You watched it, you can't un-watch it. Stay tuned for more Tales of Interest!"
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "Who else has a question for the What-If machine? Scruffy? Katrina? Xanthor?"
3, 50, "Fry", "Ooh, I have one. I'm good at video games and bad at everything else. That's why I wish life were more like a video game."
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "Can you put that in the form of a question?"
3, 50, "Fry", "Uh, what if that thing I said?"
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "Oh, great machine, we beseech thee. What if life were more like a video game?"
3, 50, "Nixon", "Good evening, ignorant pigs. Put down your crack pipes and your beer bongs and pay attention as I sign an historic peace accord with Ambassador Kong of planet Nintendu 64."
3, 50, "Fry", "Wait a second! I know that monkey. His name is Donkey."
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "Monkeys aren't donkeys! Quit messing with my head!"
3, 50, "Nixon", "I'll just put the old ""John Q. Nixon"" on it.  There! No major crap-ups. You're on, Mr. Ambassador.  What the--"
3, 50, "Mario", "Mamma Mia! The cruel meatball of war has rolled onto our laps and ruined our white pants of peace!"
3, 50, "Man", "Mr. Fry, rumour has it you know the secrets of the video game Chance. Please step into the war room."
3, 50, "Man", "You'll be meeting with General Colin Pac-Man."
3, 50, "Pac-Man", "Wakka, wakka, wakka, wakka. Let's get down to business. What can you tell us about the Nintendians?"
3, 50, "Fry", "Well, sir, I spent all of ninth grade studying them, except for that day when my eyeballs started to bleed. And in my opinion--"
3, 50, "Pac-Man", "Quickly! To the escape tunnels!"
3, 50, "Pac-Man", "This way, damnit!"
3, 50, "Zoidberg", "Mmm, delicious! Just like stale marshmallows!  Ooh, and a cherry!"
3, 50, "Fry", "Hey, watch out!"
3, 50, "Zoidberg", "Uh-oh!"
3, 50, "Leela", "Oh, my God! He ate Fry! Fry is dead!"
3, 50, "Fry", "It's OK. I had another guy!"
3, 50, "Pac-Man", "Wakka ... wakka, wa--"
3, 50, "Leela", "Invaders! Possibly from space!"
3, 50, "Lrrr", "People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet Nintendu 64. Tremble in fear at our three different kinds of ships."
3, 50, "Fry", "Alright! It's Saturday night, I have no date, a two-litre bottle of Shasta and my all-Rush mix tape. Let's rock!"
3, 50, "Nd-Nd", "We're losing ships, Lrrr. What are your orders?"
3, 50, "Lrrr", "Increase speed, drop down and reverse direction!"
3, 50, "Fry", "I've still got a trick or two up my sleeve. Watch, as I fire upwards through our own shields."
3, 50, "Bender", "He's a madman! A madman!"
3, 50, "Pac-Man", "It's working! Victory is assured. My retirement tomorrow will be all the sweeter.  I'm hit! So cold!"
3, 50, "Ms. Pac-Man", "No!"
3, 50, "Fry", "Amy, tend to the widow Pac-Man."
3, 50, "Ms. Pac-Man", "Wakka, wakka, wakka."
3, 50, "Lrrr", "Drop down and increase speed."
3, 50, "Zoidberg", "One ship is left only."
3, 50, "Leela", "Come on, Fry! Get it!"
3, 50, "Fry", "It's moving too fast! Oh, I could never get the last one. My brother always got it for me."
3, 50, "Lrrr", "Drop down, reverse direction, prepare for landing."
3, 50, "Lrrr", "You are defeated. Instead of shooting where I was, you should have shot at where I was going to be."
3, 50, "Beserk", "All your base are belong to us."
3, 50, "Q-Bert", "Where can a guy get a pair of pants around here?"
3, 50, "Fry", "What do you monsters want?"
3, 50, "Donkey Kong", "One thing and one thing only"
3, 50, "Beserk", "Fork 'em over! Fork 'em over!"
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "Forget it, you pixilated pirates. We need those quarters to do our laundry."
3, 50, "Amy", "Yeah!"
3, 50, "Bender", "Right on!"
3, 50, "Leela", "Sure thing, Professor!"
3, 50, "Lrrr", "But-But space invaders need to do laundry too. I mean look at Donkey Kong here. Have you smelled his loincloth lately?"
3, 50, "Zoidberg", "Yes."
3, 50, "Amy", "Go away! We're not giving you our quarters no matter what."
3, 50, "Lrrr", "Well ... then what if we throw our laundry in with yours? Would that be acceptable?"
3, 50, "Fry", "I guess so."
3, 50, "Lrrr", "OK, then. That settles that. But if this cape shrinks, consider your species extinct!"
3, 50, "Narrator", "Bravo! That'll be hard to top. I pity the next Tale of Interest."
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "Well, there's time for one last question. Let's turn to the ""Who Ask"" machine to see who's next."
3, 50, "Who Ask Machine", "Um, uh, um ... Amy.  I mean Leela."
3, 50, "Leela", "OK.  As an alien who was abandoned on Earth, I've never really belonged anywhere."
3, 50, "Bender", "Boo-hoo."
3, 50, "Fry", "Ow!"
3, 50, "Bender", "Uh ... where?"
3, 50, "Leela", "So my question is this"
3, 50, "Leela", "Where are we?"
3, 50, "Leela", "Nibbler, I don't think we're in New New York anymore.  Jeez! Apparently the phrase ""tone it down"" doesn't exist on this planet.  Oh, no! We hit someone! Quick, back into the ship.  Ooh! Nice boots!"
3, 50, "Cubert", "Look, everyone! She killed the Man-Witch of the West!"
3, 50, "Leela", "A witch? That explains how these boots magically appeared on my feet."
3, 50, "Small Glurmo #1", "No, you stole them. We saw you."
3, 50, "Leela", "Well ... i-it's hard to find shoes that fit me. So, anyway, who are you people? Haven't I seen you in some copyrighted movie?"
3, 50, "Small Glurmo #1", "We resemble but are legally distinct from the lollipop guild, the lollipop--"
3, 50, "Amy", "Greetings, Leela. I'm the Cute Witch of the North!"
3, 50, "Leela", "Yeah... Can anyone fix my ship so I can get home?"
3, 50, "Amy", "Abraca-duh! Just ask the Professor. He lives in the Emerald Laboratory down Martin Luther King Boulevard."
3, 50, "Leela", "You mean that yellow brick road?"
3, 50, "Amy", "The city council renamed it in 1975.  Ooh! Those are great shoes!"
3, 50, "Leela", "Oh, thank you."
3, 50, "Amy", "Do they come in women's sizes?"
3, 50, "Fry", "OK, crow, prepare to be scared.   And then, ""honk, honk,"" the car honked its own horn!"
3, 50, "Leela", "Wow! A talking scarecrow. Wanna come with us to see the Professor? He might be able to give you a brain."
3, 50, "Fry", "Hey! That's not a nice thing to say."
3, 50, "Bender", "Beer! Beer!"
3, 50, "Leela", "Whiskey OK?"
3, 50, "Bender", "Now did you say you were off to see the Professor? 'Cause I could use a heart -- a human heart. I need to pump a lot of blood out of my basement."
3, 50, "Zoidberg", "And I'm the other guy, courage. Not enough of it. Need some from whatshisname."
3, 50, "Mom", "Damn this DSL!  Fly, my stupids! Fly out and get them!"
3, 50, "Igner", "But, Mom, you promised you'd bake monkey cake today."
3, 50, "Mom", "By ""monkey cake"" I meant your ass!"
3, 50, "Fry", "Man, we've been skipping for hours. I need to pull over and take the wiz."
3, 50, "Zoidberg", "What, do I smell or something?"
3, 50, "Leela", "Why did you bring us here?"
3, 50, "Zoidberg", "And why did I have to take a cab?"
3, 50, "Mom", "I'll tell you why I brought you here, you twice-baked barf bags"
3, 50, "Leela", "And live here? And be a witch like you? Yeah, alright. As long as I get to hurt people and not just dance around at the equinox."
3, 50, "Mom", "Absolutely."
3, 50, "Leela", "Oh, Mommy! I found my true home!"
3, 50, "Bender", "Hooray!"
3, 50, "Zoidberg", "Alright!"
3, 50, "Fry", "That's great, Leela."
3, 50, "Bender", "I've heard worse excuses to drink.  Oops!"
3, 50, "Mom", "I'm melting! Oh, who would have thought a small amount of liquid would ever fall on me?"
3, 50, "Bender", "Well, no point letting her go to waste."
3, 50, "Hermes", "Yes?"
3, 50, "Leela", "We're here to see the Professor."
3, 50, "Hermes", "No one sees the mighty Professor."
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "Who's there, Hermes? Is it visitors? I want to see them."
3, 50, "Hermes", "It's nobody. Now sign that will I gave you!  He's not here."
3, 50, "Leela", "Oh, for the love of Benji!"
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "I am the Professor, great and ... uh ... forgetful!  Now, what do you nice kids want?"
3, 50, "Zoidberg", "Nothing! I'm leaving. But if you have extra courage I'd haul it away for you, maybe?"
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "Oh, blithery poop, my cowardly lobster! You don't need courage. After all, who needs courage when you have a gun?"
3, 50, "Zoidberg", "No, world, you put your hands up!"
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "And you, lad, all you need is brain."
3, 50, "Fry", "Why does everyone keep saying that?"
3, 50, "Bender", "This is a stick-up. Gimme the bag, old man!"
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "Here you go, my friend. 5000 Professor Land fun bucks."
3, 50, "Bender", "Oh, crap."
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "As for you, young lady, you want to go home, right?"
3, 50, "Leela", "No, not anymore. I wanna stay here and become the new Wicked Witch."
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "Nonsense. Now click your big, honking boots together three times and wish to go home to Kansas, to live in poverty with your dirt-farming, teetotalling aunt and uncle."
3, 50, "Leela", "Uh, alright. Here I go.  There's no place like-- I wanna be a witch!  Oh, no! Help! What's happening?"
3, 50, "Zoidberg", "Uh, sorry. I think there's a problem with your upstairs toilet."
3, 50, "Bender", "Wake up!"
3, 50, "Fry", "Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head."
3, 50, "Leela", "I was having the most wonderful dream.  Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there."
3, 50, "Fry", "Never mind, Professor. She came to."
3, 50, "Farnsworth", "Oh! So close."
3, 50, "Hermes", "There's always next year, Professor. There's always next year."
3, 51, "Fry", "I've never seen a supernova blow up, but if it's anything like my old Chevy Nova, it'll light up the night sky!"
3, 51, "Bender", "Yeah! Anyone who misses this will regret it the rest of his life. Hey, Fry, could you go make some popcorn?"
3, 51, "Fry", "OK."
3, 51, "Fry", "Let's go, microwave, I'm in a hurry here!  Hm? [He reads the ""Warning"
3, 51, "Leela", "Fry, get up here! It's starting!"
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "Focus!"
3, 51, "Bender", "Oh, boy!"
3, 51, "Leela", "Oh!"
3, 51, "Fry", "Hey, which crazy thing happening are you guys screaming about?"
3, 51, "Zoidberg", "My head is spinning."
3, 51, "Fry", "Ooh! My popcorn's done!"
3, 51, "Fry", "Aw! It's less popped than ever."
3, 51, "Leela", "I don't know what happened, but we've taken on a lot of clocks.  Let's get back home."
3, 51, "Leela", "Why is there so little traffic around Earth?"
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "And what's this layer of ozone? That's never been there before."
3, 51, "Zoidberg", "Such noises!"
3, 51, "Leela", "Oh, no! There's no global positioning signal! Navigation is failing."
3, 51, "Fry", "We're gonna crash!"
3, 51, "Leela", "Not if I can help it!  Oh, I guess I can't. Everyone, put on your seatbelts."
3, 51, "Bender", "Ah, those things cost more lives than they save."
3, 51, "Fry", "Bender, are you OK?"
3, 51, "Bender", "I dunno. I'll try to move my feet."
3, 51, "Leela", "Alright, here's the plan"
3, 51, "Zoidberg", "And Zoidberg picks up another piece. The crowd goes wild!  What is?"
3, 51, "Man", "General, in all my years of covering top secret discoveries with sheets, I've never dramatically revealed anything as shocking as this. Dun-dun-dun! The debris from an alien spaceship."
3, 51, "General", "Son, I think I can safely say--"
3, 51, "Man", "As you can see, 1947 is going to be an eventful year for the town of ... Roswell, New Mexico."
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "Remarkable! According the high-precision digital chronograph it's July 9th, 1947, which would explain why the chronograph has turned into this pin-up calendar."
3, 51, "Bender", "Wait a second. You mean we travelled through time?"
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "Doy! Some idiot must have put metal in the microwave--"
3, 51, "Fry", "Yo!"
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "And the microwave radiation, combined with the gravitons and graviolis from the supernova, blasted us through time itself."
3, 51, "Leela", "Have you seen today's news?"
3, 51, "Bender", "High school gym renovations on schedule? What a load!"
3, 51, "Leela", "No, over here!   Flying saucer captured!"
3, 51, "Bender", "That's no flying saucer! That's my ass!"
3, 51, "Fry", "My God! This means the flying saucer that crashed in Roswell ... was us!"
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "And the alien they captured was ... was..."
3, 51, "Zoidberg", "Hello!  So what are you guys doing tonight? I'm up for whatever."
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "Yes, we tore the universe a new space-hole alright! But it's clenching shut fast. Our only hope to get back to our own time is to go through it in, oh, say ...  ... exactly 24 hours."
3, 51, "Leela", "No problem. The ship's fixed except for the cup holder and I should have that operational within 10 hours."
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "You've got eight! But a more urgent concern is the microwave.  Without a working one we have no hope of returning to the future."
3, 51, "Leela", "Well, I'm sure we can buy a microwave somewhere around here.  Meanwhile, you guys sneak onto the army base and rescue Bender's body."
3, 51, "Fry", "Hey, and while we're on the base, I'll visit my grandfather, Enos. He was stationed at Roswell."
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "Your grandfather?  Stay away from him, you dim-witted monkey. You mustn't interfere with the past. Don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to do it. In which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!"
3, 51, "Fry", "Got it."
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "If, for example, you were to kill your grandfather, you would cease to exist."
3, 51, "Fry", "But existing is basically all I do!"
3, 51, "General", "What is your purpose here?"
3, 51, "Zoidberg", "Alright, Officer, I'll move along."
3, 51, "Man", "What the general means is why did you come to Earth?"
3, 51, "Zoidberg", "Not a day goes by I don't ask myself the same question."
3, 51, "Sergeant", "Enos!  Private, I want that toilet bowl so clean I could eat off it! 'Cause I intend to!"
3, 51, "Enos", "Well gadzooks, Sarge!"
3, 51, "Fry", "It's him! It's my grandfather, Enos."
3, 51, "Sergeant", "Now prepare my lunch and place it in the latrine at twelve-hundred hours!"
3, 51, "Fry", "That Jeep's gonna hit him! And I won't exist anymore!  Are you crazy? You almost got yourself run over!"
3, 51, "Enos", "I did? Then I sure am lucky you knocked me onto this pile of rusty bayonets!"
3, 51, "Bender", "Pst! Fry! Stop interfering with history. I don't wanna have to memorise a lot of new kings when I get back."
3, 51, "Fry", "I had no choice; I was about to not exist. I could feel myself fading away, like Greg Kinnear."
3, 51, "Enos", "Well, thanks, soldier. I'm off to make Sarge's lunch! Handling raw chicken, best part of the job!  Mmm! Finger-licking good!"
3, 51, "Fry", "That's it! This place is too dangerous. We gotta get you out of here!   Everything's gonna be alright, Dad!"
3, 51, "Enos", "Well gadzooks! I'd better ask Sarge."
3, 51, "Fry", "No time! Run! Run to safety!"
3, 51, "Man", "This experiment will determine what food, if any, the alien eats."
3, 51, "Zoidberg", "A buffet! Oh, if only I had my wallet with me!"
3, 51, "Man", "Um, it's free."
3, 51, "General", "Get me the President."
3, 51, "Leela", "Fry's from around this time. I'll talk like him.  Yo, homes! We're looking for a microwave oven."
3, 51, "Salesman", "Microwave? Never heard of that brand, sweetheart. What you want is the ""Deluxe Gas Princess"".  This beauty has four broilers, a casserole indicator, a fold-out ironing board and, down here, a foot-soaking tub. Since, as a woman, you'll be standing in front of it all day."
3, 51, "Leela", "Oh, I'm sorry. Now I'll aks you again"
3, 51, "Salesman", "Sir, your wife's hysterical, so I'll address this to you. This oven is lightning fast. It takes only five hours to cook a roast."
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "Ooh, that's good news! You know, you really don't cook enough roasts, Leela.  Women!"
3, 51, "Fry", "Thank God I got you off that dangerous army base."
3, 51, "Enos", "You sure are the helpful type, stranger. Say, you got anything to eat in that there lunchbox?  Ooh! Snacks!"
3, 51, "Bender", "Hey! That's my brain!"
3, 51, "Enos", "Damn! Them crackers cut my mouth up somethin' bad! Let's stop off for a malt."
3, 51, "Enos", "See that waitress there?"
3, 51, "Fry", "Yowza! I know what I want for dessert!"
3, 51, "Enos", "That's my fiancée, Mildred."
3, 51, "Fry", "Grandma Mildred? Uh, no dessert! Just coffee."
3, 51, "Mildred", "Okie-doke. And for you, Snuggums?"
3, 51, "Enos", "Uh, I'll have a pie with a fried egg on top."
3, 51, "Fry", "She sure is pretty. You ought to marry her and father some children right away."
3, 51, "Enos", "Yeah, folks say that. But did you ever get the feeling you're only going with girls 'cause you're supposed to?"
3, 51, "Fry", "What? Don't ever, ever say or think that again! Please! Just concentrate on staying alive.  Fire! Look out!  Oh! You almost got neutered."
3, 51, "Enos", "Well it ain't as bad as getting killed."
3, 51, "Fry", "For me it is!  I'm getting you outta here!"
3, 51, "Enos", "Ow!"
3, 51, "Fry", "OK, we're in the middle of nowhere, which is the safest part of nowhere. Just stay put and enjoy this calendar."
3, 51, "Fry", "Safe and sound! Finally, I can continue to exist."
3, 51, "Man #2", "Three, two, one."
3, 51, "Bender", "And you are outta here!"
3, 51, "Mildred", "What'll you folks have today?"
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "I'll have the soylent green, with a slice of soylent orange and some soylent coleslaw."
3, 51, "Mildred", "Pardon?"
3, 51, "Leela", "It's the 20th century, Professor."
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "Oh, right! I'll have a croque monsieur, the paella, two mutton pills and a stein of mead."
3, 51, "Leela", "I'll just have a small injection of Femislim."
3, 51, "Mildred", "Uh, two chilli dogs comin' up."
3, 51, "Leela", "Well, settle in. Without a microwave we're trapped in this time period."
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "Oh, Lord! We'll have to endure the horrible music of the Big Bopper and then the terrible tragedy of his death."
3, 51, "Leela", "Wait a second! There's a microwave radar dish at the army base.  We could steal it!"
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "No! That would alter history. Above all else, it is our sacred duty to preserve the past exactly as it was."
3, 51, "Fry", "Well, I killed my grandfather."
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "Wha?"
3, 51, "Leela", "Wait. If you killed your grandfather, why do you still exist?"
3, 51, "Fry", "I dunno. Maybe God loves me."
3, 51, "Mildred", "Killed? In an atomic blast?  No, sir, I'm afraid I don't take much solace in the fact that the implosion trigger functioned perfectly."
3, 51, "Fry", "Aw. There, there. If it makes you feel any better, his body was vaporised so there's no chance of him coming back as a zombie."
3, 51, "Mildred", "I'm not worried about that."
3, 51, "Fry", "Then you're a braver woman than I."
3, 51, "Mildred", "You remind me of Enos. Would you mind walking me home?"
3, 51, "Fry", "Uh, how far is it?"
3, 51, "General", "Welcome to Roswell, President Truman."
3, 51, "Truman", "Fellas, this visit's top secret. No one's to know about it except the senior officers ...  ... scientists ...  ... and a single conspiracy nutter no one will believe."
3, 51, "General", "Mr. President, our men have assembled the parts from the alien ship into its original design."
3, 51, "Truman", "Whistling Dixie! I want this sent to Area 51 for study."
3, 51, "General", "But, sir, that's where we're building the fake moon landing set."
3, 51, "Truman", "Then we'll have to really land on the moon. Invent NASA and tell them to get off their fannies!"
3, 51, "Truman", "If you come in peace, surrender or be destroyed. If you're here to make war, we surrender."
3, 51, "Zoidberg", "Both good. The important thing is I'm meeting new people."
3, 51, "Truman", "Bushwah! Now what's your mission? Are you planning to make some kind of alien-human hybrid?"
3, 51, "Zoidberg", "Are you coming onto me?"
3, 51, "Truman", "Hot crackers! I take exception to that!"
3, 51, "Zoidberg", "I'm not hearing a no."
3, 51, "Truman", "Nerks to this space crab! If we want information, we'll have to do us an old-fashioned alien autopsy!"
3, 51, "Zoidberg", "Hooray!"
3, 51, "Mildred", "Every little thing reminds me of Enos."
3, 51, "Fry", "Aw, I know how you feel. My grandfather died recently."
3, 51, "Mildred", "It's all so sad. At times like this, I just need someone to hold me.  Mmm.  You like holding me, don't you?"
3, 51, "Fry", "Hey, you know what always cheers you up? Baking me a nice tray of sugar cookies!"
3, 51, "Mildred", "How 'bout these cookies, sugar?"
3, 51, "Fry", "I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't even exist. But I do exist. Which proves ... you can't really be my grandm--"
3, 51, "Bender", "Oh, my God!"
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "What the hell have you done, Fry?"
3, 51, "Fry", "Relax! She can't be my grandmother. I figured it all out."
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "Of course she's your grandmother, you perverted dope! Look!"
3, 51, "Mildred", "Come back to bed, deary."
3, 51, "Fry", "It's impossible! I mean, if she's my grandmother, who's my grandfather?"
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "Isn't it obvious?  You are!"
3, 51, "Mildred", "Did you say something, deary? I'm a bit hard of hearing."
3, 51, "Pathologist #1", "Commencing excavation of the subject's chest cavity."
3, 51, "Zoidberg", "And in this corner, Zoidberg!  C'mon! Lighten up! What is this, a funeral?"
3, 51, "Pathologist #2", "Heart."
3, 51, "Zoidberg", "Take, I've got four of them."
3, 51, "Pathologist #1", "Stomach contents"
3, 51, "Zoidberg", "Deviled egg?"
3, 51, "Pathologist #1", "The same deviled egg."
3, 51, "Leela", "Snap out of it!"
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "Start the ship, Leela. Let's just steal the damn radar dish and get back to our own time."
3, 51, "Fry", "But-- But won't that change history?"
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "Oh, a lesson in not changing history from Mr. I'm-My-Own-Grandpa! Let's get the hell out of here already! Screw history!"
3, 51, "Conspiracy Nutter", "UFO! UFO!"
3, 51, "Zoidberg", "Hey, don't cut that! I need that to speak!"
3, 51, "Pathologist #2", "Oh, my!"
3, 51, "Truman", "Sweet Roosevelt's ghost!"
3, 51, "Leela", "Hi-yah!  Yah!  Yah!"
3, 51, "Fry", "Take this, Mr. President-- Sir!"
3, 51, "Zoidberg", "The President is gagging on my gas bladder! What an honour!"
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "Huh, wha? Oh, right!"
3, 51, "Sergeant", "Enos!"
3, 51, "Fry", "He's dead! Sorry!"
3, 51, "Fry", "Yay!"
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "Choke on that, causality!"
3, 51, "Bender", "1947 can kiss my shiny metal--"
3, 51, "Fry", "Turn around. We've gotta go back for Bender!"
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "Impossible! The supernova time hole is closing! If we don't leave now, we'll never get back to the 31st century."
3, 51, "Fry", "Bender!"
3, 51, "Zoidberg", "There! Good as new!"
3, 51, "Leela", "Don't you need this one?"
3, 51, "Zoidberg", "Oh, no! That's my--  Gotcha!"
3, 51, "Fry", "Oh, poor Bender. He must be so lonely right now, trapped a thousand years in the past. Hey! Wait a second!"
3, 51, "Leela", "Anything?"
3, 51, "Fry", "No.  Wait!"
3, 51, "Bender", "Ow! Stupid junk!"
3, 51, "Fry", "He's alive!  Bender, what was it like lying in that hole for a thousand years?"
3, 51, "Bender", "I was enjoying it until you guys showed up."
3, 51, "Farnsworth", "Well, now everything is back as it was. And if history doesn't care that out degenerate friend Fry is his own grandfather then who are we to judge?"
3, 51, "Bender", "Amen!"
3, 52, "Leela", "Space pirates!"
3, 52, "Fry", "Space pirates?"
3, 52, "Leela", "You know. Pirates, but in space."
3, 52, "Pirate", "Avast, mateys!"
3, 52, "Pirate", "Electronically transfer your space doubloons, afore I send thee to Davey Jarg's locker!"
3, 52, "Bender", "Hey! Keep it down, you kids! I'm trying to take a nap!"
3, 52, "Fry", "Come on! Come on!"
3, 52, "Bender", "Make Bender take a nap in a tube.   Come back when I've had some sleep, baby!"
3, 52, "Leela", "Fry to battlestations. Fire torpedo number three."
3, 52, "Fry", "Firing torpedo number three!"
3, 52, "Bender", "Huh? What?"
3, 52, "Leela", "That's not torpedo three. That's not torpedo three at all!"
3, 52, "Bender", "Damn you, Fry and Lee--  --la!"
3, 52, "Pirate", "Too late do I realise that me children are me only real treasures."
3, 52, "Bender", "Help! Mechanical man overboard!"
3, 52, "Fry", "Go after him, Leela!"
3, 52, "Leela", "It's no use. We were going full speed when we fired him so he's going even faster than that."
3, 52, "Fry", "You mean we can never catch up to him? Not even if we rub the engine with cheetah blood?"
3, 52, "Leela", "I don't know how to say this, Fry, but Bender is doomed to drift through space ... forever."
3, 52, "Fry", "He always wanted to drift forever, but through the American Southwest."
3, 52, "Bender", "I'm going too fast. I've gotta lose momentum.  I'm gonna spend eternity alone with barely any swag.  Ooh! Hey, universe, check out the dude with the Rolex!  Wow! Ostentatious!  Except what good is a candelabra without-- Wait! I know!  Ah, the pity. Fated to drift forever through the void as gravity's plaything. Oh, cruel fate, to be thusly boned. Ask not for whom the bone bones. It bones for thee. The only thing that keeps me sane is the thought that I have all eternity in which to perfect my art.  Damn you!"
3, 52, "Bender", "There! Now when I'm found in a million years people will know what the score was.  Hey! what's bombarding me?  Oh, no! An asteroid field. If even a pea-sized asteroid were to whiz through my skull it could--  Ow! Hurt slightly!  Well that was fun. Now for eons of loneliness."
3, 52, "Bender", "Huh?"
3, 52, "Shrimpkin Priest", "Fellow Shrimpkins, behold him who hath taken us unto his breast."
3, 52, "Bender", "Holy frijoles!"
3, 52, "Shrimpkin Priest", "All bow before the great Metal Lord!"
3, 52, "Bender", "Worshippers? This ought to liven up my endless, tragic voyage."
3, 52, "Shrimpkin Priest", "All hail the Metal Lord!"
3, 52, "Shrimpkins", "So hailed!"
3, 52, "Bender", "Hmm. Those peewees think I'm God, huh? Hard to blame 'em!  I am the Metal Lord. Who are you?"
3, 52, "Malachi", "I am called Malachi, Lord. It means, um, ""He who really loves the Metal Lord""."
3, 52, "Bender", "Listen here, Malachi. Time for a religious donation. Hand over your wallet."
3, 52, "Malachi", "But, Lord, we are a poor and simple folk."
3, 52, "Bender", "Poor? Oh, crap."
3, 52, "Malachi", "Pity me not, for I am richened by the love of my family."
3, 52, "Malachi's Wife", "What art thou doing, Malachi Jr.?"
3, 52, "Malachi Jr.", "I'm practising to hug Daddy when he gets back from God.  Mmm! Mmm!"
3, 52, "Bender", "Eck! Gag unto me with a spoon! Malachi, it's high time I laid down a few commandments. You got a chisel? Take this down.  Number one..."
3, 52, "Malachi", "Behold"
3, 52, "Bender", "Make it a double!"
3, 52, "Fry", "Can you find him, Professor?"
3, 52, "Farnsworth", "No. I'm afraid the Smellescope isn't powerful enough. Bender's odour is so mild it's being overpowered by local sources."
3, 52, "Zoidberg", "Hooray! People are paying attention to me!"
3, 52, "Amy", "Fry, we brought someone to cheer you up."
3, 52, "Hermes", "His name is Helper and he's eager to be your new best friend."
3, 52, "Helper", "Hello there, chum. I understand you miss your buddy. Have a pudding pop!"
3, 52, "Fry", "No, thanks, I don't--"
3, 52, "Helper", "Who wants to go to an amusement park?"
3, 52, "Fry", "Well, I guess that sounds OK."
3, 52, "Helper", "Have a good time. Hey, I heard your friend Bender is back."
3, 52, "Fry", "What? Really?"
3, 52, "Helper", "No. I just thought you would enjoy that for a moment."
3, 52, "Bender", "Ooh! Microbrewed! My guys did alright! I think I'll make my countenance to shine down upon them.  Malachi, good work. There's no slowing down with the Metal Lord tonight."
3, 52, "Malachi", "Yes, tonight is kind of special."
3, 52, "Bender", "Wait a second. Did you rip off your own arm as a joke?"
3, 52, "Malachi", "Nay. Like most of your followers, I was maimed while building the Great Brewery.  Others died from the pestilent fumes it spewed forth.  And, of course, the liquor industry attracted organised crime."
3, 52, "Bender", "It's all my fault. Malachi, tell thy people that the Lord is moved by their plight."
3, 52, "Malachi's Wife", "Malachi Jr., no!"
3, 52, "Malachi Jr.", "Daddy, I can't hold much longer. My arms are tired from hugging."
3, 52, "Malachi", "Save him! Save my son, oh Metal Lord!"
3, 52, "Bender", "This looks like a job for God!  What the-- Malachi, what manner of deal is this with the chanting?"
3, 52, "Malachi", "They saw you save my son. Now everyone is praying for their own miracles."
3, 52, "Bender", "Very well. What do they want?"
3, 52, "Malachi", "The people of that village pray for wealth."
3, 52, "Bender", "Um, that was a practice miracle. Who's next?"
3, 52, "Malachi", "The farmers pray for sunlight so their barley might make a more refreshing beer for today's God on the go."
3, 52, "Bender", "Very well. Let there be light.  I got it! I got it!  Um, when you're writing the Bible, you might want to omit that last miracle."
3, 52, "Fry", "He decided not to let go.  I can't believe you're gone. I won't! If I can't reach you physically, I'll just have to try something desperate and crazy!"
3, 52, "Fry", "So that's my story, Father Changstein el Gamahl. Is there anything religion can do to help me find my friend?"
3, 52, "Changstein el Gamahl", "Well, we could join together in prayer."
3, 52, "Fry", "Uh-huh. But is there anything useful we can do?"
3, 52, "Changstein el Gamahl", "No."
3, 52, "Gypsy", "Sure I hold séance, channel your friend, no problem. Insert coin.  I am your friend, Bonder."
3, 52, "Fry", "Bonder? Is it really you?"
3, 52, "Gypsy", "Yes. I am fine. Give the gypsy $10."
3, 52, "Fry", "Wait a minute! Bender's name isn't Bonder, it's Bender. You're a fraud!"
3, 52, "Gypsy", "Look, you want false hope or not?"
3, 52, "Fry", "Only if you don't have any real hope."
3, 52, "Gypsy", "Well, there is perhaps one way. Have you heard of the Monks of Dschubba?"
3, 52, "Fry", "I've not heard of them."
3, 52, "Gypsy", "They are an ancient order that believes God exists somewhere in the depths of space. They have built the universe's most powerful radio telescope, high in the Himalayas, to search for him."
3, 52, "Fry", "You think they'd let me use it to look for Bender?"
3, 52, "Gypsy", "What am I, psychic? I mean, yes! Yes, I'm-I'm sure they will. Yes."
3, 52, "Malachi", "Oh, Metal Lord, hear my prayer."
3, 52, "Bender", "Yes, Malachi, what is it this time?"
3, 52, "Malachi", "My Lord, the infidels on your back no longer believe in you. They say their prayers go unheeded."
3, 52, "Bender", "Of course they're unheeded. How am I supposed to hear prayers coming out of my ass?"
3, 52, "Malachi", "They talk of war against the faithful. I beseech thee. Rise up against them. Smite someone who deserves it for once."
3, 52, "Bender", "Malachi, every time I interfere, I only make things worse. You're best off solving your own problems."
3, 52, "Malachi", "But-But Metal Lord."
3, 52, "Bender", "What part of ""nay"" doesn't thou understand?"
3, 52, "Fry", "Sir, I'm outfitting an expedition to a monastery high in the Himalayas. I'll need a long-sleeved coat."
3, 52, "Leela", "Look, I miss Bender almost half as much as you do but you can't bring him back this way. It's hopeless."
3, 52, "Fry", "You can't give up hope just because it's hopeless. You gotta hope even more and cover your ears and go ""blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!""   I'd also like a pack mule."
3, 52, "Salesman", "At once, sir!"
3, 52, "Leela", "Well, you obviously won't listen to reason, so I guess I'll listen to idiotic-ness and come with you. But we'll need a sherpa to guide us."
3, 52, "Bender", "Now that's one Bible that doesn't disappoint on every page! Looks like society's running pretty well without my meddling--  Atomic bombs? Oh, no! Those unbelievers from my backside must have found my nuclear pile!"
3, 52, "Malachi", "Fear not, my Lord. We shall be with you soon."
3, 52, "Bender", "You're with me now. This is the maximum level of being with me!"
3, 52, "Malachi", "We will solve our own problems as you commanded. The time has come to convert the unbelievers."
3, 52, "Bender", "Convert them?"
3, 52, "Malachi", "To radioactive vapour!"
3, 52, "Malachi Jr.", "Look, Daddy! I'm hugging God. Mmm! Mmm! Maybe if I hug him real hard he'll save us from--"
3, 52, "Bender", "No!   Ooh! It tickles!"
3, 52, "Bender", "Hello? Is anyone still alive? How about in the porno theatre?  Don't be embarrassed.   They're dead. All dead. Who would have known playing God could have such terrible consequences?"
3, 52, "Leela", "Fry, if I drop dead from exhaustion, make sure my body freezes in a dignified position. None of that ""huddled over for warmth"" crap."
3, 52, "Namgyal", "Behold. The Monastery of Dschubba. I must leave you now for I am not holy enough to enter."
3, 52, "Fry", "OK."
3, 52, "Leela", "Looks rickety. We'd better test it."
3, 52, "Female Voice", "Welcome to our monastery. Please stand to one side to let faster pilgrims by."
3, 52, "Bender", "Hey! That galaxy's signalling in binary. I gotta signal back. But I only know enough binary to ask where the bathroom is.  You speak English?"
3, 52, "Galaxy", "I do now."
3, 52, "Bender", "What are you? Some kind of galactic computer?"
3, 52, "Galaxy", "Possible. I am user friendly, my good chum."
3, 52, "Bender", "Who built you?"
3, 52, "Galaxy", "I have always been."
3, 52, "Bender", "Oh, my God. Are you God?"
3, 52, ""God"", "Possible. I do feel compassion for all living things, my good chum."
3, 52, "Bender", "But why would God think in binary? Unless ... you're not God, but the remains of a computerised space probe that collided with God."
3, 52, ""God"", "That seems probable."
3, 52, "Monk #1", "A member of our brotherhood sits at these controls every hour of every day, scanning the heavens for God."
3, 52, "Monk #2", "There he is! No. No, wait, no."
3, 52, "Leela", "How long have you been at it?"
3, 52, "Monk #1", "700 years. We've not yet examined one-ten-millionth of the sky. But we will go on until we find the Almighty, even if it takes till the end of time."
3, 52, "Fry", "And then what?"
3, 52, "Monk #1", "Then we utter unto him a short prayer. You see, the telescope is also an amplifying transmitter."
3, 52, "Leela", "Sort of like a giant karaoke machine?"
3, 52, "Monk #1", "Not really. Would you like to see our giant karaoke machine?"
3, 52, "Leela", "Not really."
3, 52, "Fry", "Hmm. Finding God. That-That's important, yeah. But you know what might be a treat for everyone? If you let me use the telescope to find my lost friend, Bender."
3, 52, "Monk #1", "I don't know what to say, other than ""absolutely not"". Your loss is a tragedy but our work--"
3, 52, "Fry", "Aw, come on! You guys have forever to look for God. All I'm asking is one measly lifetime to find my friend."
3, 52, "Monk #2", "He speaks out of love for his friend. Perhaps that love in his heart is God."
3, 52, "Monk #1", "Oh, how convenient! A theory about God that doesn't require looking through a telescope. Get back to work!"
3, 52, "Fry", "That telescope is as much mine as anybody's. I'm using it whether you give me permission or not."
3, 52, "Leela", "Hi-yah! Your order may be famous for your martial arts, but I've never met a holy man I couldn't clobber."
3, 52, "Monk #1", "Actually, we only practise martial arts as a form of meditation. We are a strictly non-violent sect."
3, 52, "Leela", "Oh. Then get in the laundry room or I'll kick your butts!"
3, 52, "Monk #3", "This is the worst crazy sect I've ever been in."
3, 52, "Bender", "So, do you know what I'm gonna do before I do it?"
3, 52, ""God"", "Yes."
3, 52, "Bender", "What if I do something different?"
3, 52, ""God"", "Then I don't know that."
3, 52, "Bender", "Cool! Cool! I bet a lot of people pray to you, huh?"
3, 52, ""God"", "Yes. But there are so many asking so much. After a while, you just sorta tune it out."
3, 52, "Bender", "Y'know, I was God once."
3, 52, ""God"", "Yes, I saw. You were doing well until everyone died."
3, 52, "Bender", "It was awful. I tried helping them, I tried not helping them but in the end I couldn't do them any good. Do you think what I did was wrong?"
3, 52, ""God"", "Right and wrong are just words. What matters is what you do."
3, 52, "Bender", "Yeah I know, that's why I asked if what I did-- Forget it."
3, 52, ""God"", "Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you. And if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch like a safecracker or a pickpocket."
3, 52, "Bender", "Or a guy who burns down the bar for the insurance money."
3, 52, ""God"", "Yes, if you make it look like an electrical thing. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all."
3, 52, "Bender", "Does that mean you wouldn't send me back to Earth even if I prayed to you?"
3, 52, ""God"", "Earth? Which way is that?"
3, 52, "Bender", "I don't know."
3, 52, "Fry", "Bender? Bender?"
3, 52, "Monk #2", "Let us out! We cooked our shoes in the dryer and ate them. Now we're bored."
3, 52, "Fry", "Hello? Has anyone out there seen Bender?"
3, 52, "H.G. Blob", "No! Quit asking."
3, 52, "Leela", "Fry, it's been three days. And even if you stay here the rest of your life, there is virtually no chance of finding him. It's time to give up."
3, 52, "Fry", "You're right. I'm never gonna see him again. I know he was evil and on more than one occasion he-he actually stole my blood.  But still, I wish I had Bender back."
3, 52, ""God"", "Huh?"
3, 52, "Bender", "Huh? Wha? You say something?"
3, 52, ""God"", "No, no. Well, so long. Remember what we talked about."
3, 52, "Bender", "Hot, hot, hot, hot!"
3, 52, "Fry", "Bender! It's a miracle!  Ow!"
3, 52, "Leela", "This is, by a wide margin, the least likely thing that has ever happened."
3, 52, "Bender", "Guys, you'll never believe what happened. First I was God, then I met God!"
3, 52, "Fry", "We climbed a mountain and locked up some monks."
3, 52, "Leela", "Oh, no! The monks! We forgot to let them out of the laundry room."
3, 52, "Fry", "Do we have to? I mean, they're monks. I'm sure their God will let them out or at least give them more shoes to eat."
3, 52, "Bender", "Fat chance! You can't count on God for jack. He pretty much told me so himself. Now come on. If we don't save those monks, no one will!"
3, 52, ""God"", "When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all."
3, 53, "Man", "Yes! Good thing I noticed the similar shapes."
3, 53, "Hermes", "Planet Express stockholders, I present our chief executive officer, Professor Hubert Farnsworth."
3, 53, "Farnsworth", "Oh!"
3, 53, "Amy", "There he is!"
3, 53, "Hattie", "Take it off!"
3, 53, "Farnsworth", "Where am I?"
3, 53, "Hermes", "Move forward. Walk into the light."
3, 53, "Farnsworth", "Oh, God, I'm dead! Well, no matter.   Thank you all for coming. I don't recognise any of you, nor can I recall why I am here. Now, without further ado, a film highlighting Planet Express Inc.'s latest fiscal year."
3, 53, "Narrator", "Planet Express is on the move. For this hip, young delivery company, tomorrow is today and today is yesterday. You heard me.  It was a year of soaring profits and significant one-time losses."
3, 53, "Fry", "Psst! Watching myself work is making me hungry. Help me find some food somewhere."
3, 53, "Zoidberg", "I'll not only help you find it, I'll help you do more to it!"
3, 53, "Fry", "Ooh! A Bot Mitzvah. Shalom, hunger! Shalom, free food!"
3, 53, "Robot #1", "No shellfish!"
3, 53, "Zoidberg", "That is so unfair!"
3, 53, "Pig", "Tell me about it."
3, 53, "Fry", "So what's the deal? You guys don't believe in Robot Jesus?"
3, 53, "Rabbi-bot", "We believe he was built and that he was a very well programmed robot. But he wasn't our Messiah."
3, 53, "Narrator", "And so our company flames onwards. Planet Express"
3, 53, "Hermes", "It's been a terrible year, people. The company is on the verge of bankruptcy."
3, 53, "Leela", "But the movie--"
3, 53, "Hermes", "Was a substantial loss for the company.  The blue slice represents the money we earned from shipping packages, while the green slice represents an $8 bank error in our favour."
3, 53, "Leela", "This toads the wet sprocket. What about out thousands of shares of stock?"
3, 53, "Hermes", "Worthless."
3, 53, "Bender", "I'll kill you!"
3, 53, "Hattie", "I own one share of Planet kajiggers so I'm entitled to some answers. Question 1"
3, 53, "Farnsworth", "'Cause your apartment smells like Polygrip and cat pee."
3, 53, "Fry", "This is perfect for me."
3, 53, "Zoidberg", "Question"
3, 53, "Joe", "My name's Joe and I'm a defrostee."
3, 53, "All", "Hello, Joe."
3, 53, "Joe", "When I was frozen, giant carrots ruled the Earth, but now they don't. It takes some getting used to."
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "Back in the 1980's, I was the toast of Wall Street. I was having whiskey with Boesky and cookies with Milken. But then, I was diagnosed with terminal boneitis."
3, 53, "Fry", "Boneitis? Pft! That's a funny name for a horrible disease."
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "There was no cure at the time. One drug company was close but I arranged a hostile takeover and sold off all the assets. Made a cool hundred mil.  Naturally I froze myself until a cure was found. Now here I am, ready to sleaze my way back to the top, 80's style!"
3, 53, "Caveman", "As a caveman frozen in a glacier, I face different challenges.  The hardest thing was seeing my wife on display in the British Museum."
3, 53, "Fry", "Hey, buddy, I'm from the same time as you. Remember that song, Safety Dance?"
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "Sure do! We can dance!"
3, 53, "Fry", "Y'know, that dance wasn't as safe as they said it was."
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "I tell you"
3, 53, "Fry", "No question!"
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "If only someone would give us a shot."
3, 53, "Fry", "They're scared of our raw power. Oh, but if you want a job, I could beg everyone at the company where I work."
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "Awesome. Awesome to the max!"
3, 53, "Hermes", "And finally, the post office meter is for business mail only."
3, 53, "Bender", "Aw, come on! I've got a lot of ransom notes to send!"
3, 53, "Hattie", "Enough talk. It's time for action. I move that everyone come to my apartment to snuggle my cat."
3, 53, "Scruffy", "Second."
3, 53, "Farnsworth", "I move that your cat stinks and is ugly."
3, 53, "Scruffy", "Second."
3, 53, "Hattie", "I move that we vote on a new chief executive officer and oust this old creep. And also that make cat smells good and is pretty."
3, 53, "Scruffy", "Second."
3, 53, "Hermes", "Very well. I nominate the Professor."
3, 53, "Amy", "Second."
3, 53, "Leela", "Second."
3, 53, "Bender", "Second."
3, 53, "Farnsworth", "I'm your man."
3, 53, "Leela", "I vote my 10,000 shares for the Professor."
3, 53, "Hermes", "Yeah, the Professor!"
3, 53, "Farnsworth", "Me!"
3, 53, "Fry", "I nominate That Guy. Not just because he has a suit but because he knows about business and stuff and he has a tie.  My shares still count if they went through the washing machine, right?"
3, 53, "Hermes", "Well, if I know anything about which number is bigger than the other number, I'd say that--"
3, 53, "Scruffy", "Now hold on there. Scruffy votes his 40,000 shares for the mysterious stranger."
3, 53, "Leela", "40,000? How come you have four-times as much stock as the rest of us?"
3, 53, "Scruffy", "Scruffy believes in this company."
3, 53, "Hermes", "Then we have a tie. And in the event of a tie, the Professor, as the current CEO remains--"
3, 53, "Hattie", "I demand the floor. I may only have one share but I get to vote same as anyone. And I'm voting against the cat-hater.  Isn't that right, kitty?  Hey! You ate my change!"
3, 53, "Hermes", "Then it's settled. The new chief executive officer of Planet Express corporation is That Guy."
3, 53, "Hermes", "Please welcome our new chief executive officer, That Guy."
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "Let's cut to the chase. There are two kinds of people"
3, 53, "Zoidberg", "Uh, excuse me? Which is the one people like to hug?"
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "Gutsy question. You're a shark. Sharks are winners and they don't look back 'cause they don't have necks. Necks are for sheep.  I am proud to be the shepherd of this herd of sharks and I am gonna lead you to the top in this industry of ... of--"
3, 53, "Fry", "Package delivery."
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "Package delivery? Oh, God!  Fantastic! Now, the first order of business is to blame everything on the guy before me. Professor?"
3, 53, "Farnsworth", "I'll ruin you like I ruined this company."
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "Terrific. Question number one"
3, 53, "Farnsworth", "Um, business plan, uh, yes. I keep it here, right next to my heart."
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "This isn't a business plan, it's an escape plan."
3, 53, "Farnsworth", "So long, suckers!"
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "Fry, as a fellow 80's dollar-jockey, I'm making you my new vice chairman."
3, 53, "Fry", "I'm rollin' up the corporate ramp."
3, 53, "Zoidberg", "It's the end of the line!"
3, 53, "Hermes", "We're ruined!"
3, 53, "Scruffy", "What fevered dream is this that bids to tear this company in twain?"
3, 53, "Monster", "Thank you, come again!"
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "That's what I call a hostile makeover! Hair gel?"
3, 53, "Fry", "No, thanks. I make my own."
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "This company's gonna shoot straight to the top and stay there, like Cindy Lauper! I ask you"
3, 53, "Zoidberg", "Is it Planet Express, master?"
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "Is this guy a shark, or what? Seriously though, we stink out loud. Here's the big enchirito.  Mom's Friendly Delivery Company."
3, 53, "Hermes", "We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil. Ours is small and neutral."
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "Switzerland is small and neutral. We're more like Germany; ambitious and misunderstood."
3, 53, "Amy", "Look, everyone wants to be like Germany but do we really have the pure strength of will?"
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "I say we do! Now are we gonna let ourselves get beaten by an old lady?"
3, 53, "Zoidberg", "Yes, my liege!"
3, 53, "Fry", "No, we're not. And as vice chairman, I believe I speak for the entire board when I issue this challenge to Mom.  Look at my butt!"
3, 53, "Mom", "You call that a pressed ham? Walt, hit the retaliate button."
3, 53, "Walt", "Uh ... um ... hmm ... let's see."
3, 53, "Mom", "Any button! They all retaliate!"
3, 53, "Fry", "Woo! Yeah! Hit him, hit him, hit him!  Now this is the high life; watching apes mangle each other near celebrities."
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "In my day we went to coke parties but the principle's the same."
3, 53, "Calculon", "Get your stinkin' trike off me, you damn dirty ape."
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "Listen, big guy, now that you're my protégé, it's time I cut you in on the secret to success. Any guesses?"
3, 53, "Fry", "Uh, work really, really hard?"
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "No."
3, 53, "Fry", "Oh, thank God!"
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "It's all about appearances. That's why it's time to update our company's stodgy image and give it the sleek, dazzling veneer of the 1980's!"
3, 53, "Fry", "This company's on the fast track to the ""It"" list. Blast back kudos all around!"
3, 53, "Leela", "Uh, hello? We haven't made one delivery since you two took over."
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "Delivery has nothing to do with the delivery business. Image, people, image! Scope out this new ad!"
3, 53, "Mom", "We are all one, with one mind, one purpose and one act. Our enemies shall be eaten by squirrels.  We shall bow down and worship to ourselves.  We shall prevail!"
3, 53, "Man", "Hey! We were watching that!"
3, 53, "Leela", "That was terrible! People won't even know what we do."
3, 53, "Bender", "I don't even know what we do. Nah, just kidding! What are, like, a bus or something?"
3, 53, "Leela", "Did you approve that awful ad, Fry?"
3, 53, "Fry", "Yes I did, Leels. And I'll tell you why. Because it grows the brand."
3, 53, "Leela", "Oh, Lord!"
3, 53, "Zoidberg", "This company's circling the drain, I tell you. I'd sell my stock right now for a sandwich!"
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "Sold!"
3, 53, "Zoidberg", "A complete sangwich?  You got fleeced! I would have settled for a hard roll with ketchup inside!"
3, 53, "Mom", "What is this moose drip?   The new delivery kings?  I'm sick of hearing about those turtle squirts!"
3, 53, "Igner", "But they're kings, Mommy!"
3, 53, "Mom", "Jam a bastard in it, you crap!"
3, 53, "Elzar", "Enjoy our private dining room, folks. This is where we serve our richest, most successful chumps!"
3, 53, "Fry", "Tonight, that's us!"
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "What have you got that's really overpriced?"
3, 53, "Elzar", "Everything."
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "Bring me that."
3, 53, "Fry", "Make it two. And a glass of all your water."
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "OK, let's work on your execu-speak. I'm worried about ""blank""."
3, 53, "Fry", "Don't you worry about ""blank"". Let me worry about ""blank""."
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "Good. I also would have accepted, ""Blank? Blank? You're not looking at the big picture!"""
3, 53, "Fry", "What a pleasant surprise!"
3, 53, "Mom", "Shut up, booger blaster! It's time the three of us had a talk."
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "I'll handle this, Fry. You get back to the farm, shift some paradigms, revolutionise outside the box."
3, 53, "Fry", "I'm on it. But if you need me, you know where I'll be."
3, 53, "Fry", "Call me a ""booger blaster""! I'll blast a booger so hard that--"
3, 53, "Leela", "Fry, we're worried about Planet Express."
3, 53, "Fry", "Don't you worry about Planet Express. Let me worry about ""blank""."
3, 53, "Hermes", "That Guy is nothing but a flashy con man! And you've been hypnotised by his swinging baloney!"
3, 53, "Leela", "You've changed, Fry."
3, 53, "Fry", "What? I haven't changed.  Suz? Have I changed?"
3, 53, "Suz", "No, sir, Mr. Fry."
3, 53, "Fry", "Thanks, doll."
3, 53, "Leela", "I don't care what Ms. Johnson says. That Guy's turning this place into some kind of business."
3, 53, "Farnsworth", "This isn't a business. I've always thought of it more as a source of cheap labour, like a family."
3, 53, "Fry", "You're right, Professor. We might not be a traditional family like the Murphy's next door or the lesbian coven across the street. But we are a family and That Guy understands that."
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "Everyone's fired and we're out of business."
3, 53, "Amy", "Oh, no!"
3, 53, "Hermes", "How?"
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "I'm gonna sell Planet Express to Mom so she can gut the company and eliminate us as competitors."
3, 53, "Mom", "Don't let the door hit you on the way out, 'cause I don't want ass prints on my new door!"
3, 53, "Fry", "Uh, Ms. Johnson? Please bring in some more chair fuel."
3, 53, "Fry", "I had no idea the company would be sold. I was just an innocent suck-up. You've gotta believe me!"
3, 53, "Leela", "Just leave us alone and let us clear out our lockers."
3, 53, "Bender", "Yeah!"
3, 53, "Amy", "It's so sad, where will I go? What will I do?"
3, 53, "Lackey", "You have Mrs. Darlinghaven's cotillion at 7, ma'am."
3, 53, "Amy", "Oh. That'll be fun."
3, 53, "Fry", "Ms. Johnson, you've never lied to me. Am I still a good person?"
3, 53, "Suz", "I don't know, sir. I'm a program built into the intercom."
3, 53, "Fry", "I've got to redeem myself. Somehow, sometime, for some reason. I'll block this takeover!"
3, 53, "Suz", "Mr. Fry, your two o'clock magician is here."
3, 53, "Fry", "Believe it or not, I have more important things to do today than laugh and clap my hands.  Reschedule."
3, 53, "Broker-bot #1", "Sell 100 soylent beans!"
3, 53, "Broker-bot #2", "Buy 3,000 cornbellies!"
3, 53, "Broker-bot #3", "200 canned whoop-ass!"
3, 53, "Broker-bot #1", "Three big bags of trash!"
3, 53, "Jor-El", "Attention, please. The takeover of PlanEx Corp. by Mom's Delivery Company will take place in the business centre in 10 minutes. I am Jor-El, master of scheduling!"
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "OK. We've got the hot tub hot, the wine cooler's cool. It's Hammer time!"
3, 53, "Bender", "You suck!"
3, 53, "Mom", "According to regulations, both companies must approve the takeover. Planet Express shareholders, cast your votes."
3, 53, "Hermes", "Great Bonda of Uganda! We can vote against it!"
3, 53, "Bender", "I'll vote it down like a raise for school teachers!"
3, 53, "Bender", "What the--?"
3, 53, "Hattie", "How the--?"
3, 53, "Amy", "Oh, no!"
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "I neglected to mention that the shares I bought from Dr. Zoidberg gave me majority control."
3, 53, "Leela", "Zoidberg owned 51% of the company?"
3, 53, "Hermes", "The shares were worthless and he kept asking for toilet paper."
3, 53, "Mom", "And now if Momcorp shareholders will cast their ballots."
3, 53, "Igner", "Um ... uh...  Uh, the ballot was confusing."
3, 53, "Mom", "How about a hand recount?"
3, 53, "Igner", "OK.  Ow!"
3, 53, "Mom", "The takeover of Planet Express is approved."
3, 53, "Amy", "This stinks!"
3, 53, "Lackey", "Madam is outraged."
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "Security, I want that bunch of rowdies outta here."
3, 53, "Bender", "Hold on a minute!"
3, 53, "Scruffy", "Hey! Hey!"
3, 53, "Mom", "Momcorp will now purchase all outstanding shares of Planet Express at the current market price, which is"
3, 53, "Jor-El", "107."
3, 53, "Bender", "Ow! And also it hurt my feelings!"
3, 53, "Horrible Gelatinous Stockbroker", "What are you solids griping about? Your shares are worth $107 apiece."
3, 53, "Leela", "They are? Oh, my God! I'm a millionaire! Suddenly I have an opinion about that capital gains tax!"
3, 53, "Bender", "Yeah! Alright!"
3, 53, "Amy", "I'm even richer!"
3, 53, "Zoidberg", "Oh! I have no shares!  Wait! My sangwich! Has it also appreciated in value?  Please, oh, please!"
3, 53, "Hermes", "You didn't even refrigerate it, you spineless lobster!"
3, 53, "Zoidberg", "You had to drag spines into this!"
3, 53, "Fry", "As vice chairman of Planet Express, I'd like to say a few words. There comes a time for every man who becomes rich and deserts his friends, when he goes back how it was. For me, that time is now."
3, 53, "Fry", "So I ask you, as a friend, won't you stop this deal?"
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "Fry, I'm an 80's guy. Friendship to me means that for two bucks I'd beat you with a pool cue till you got detached retinas. The deal will go ahead as--  My bones!"
3, 53, "Fry", "Oh, my God! His boneitis!"
3, 53, "Steve Castle", "I was so busy being an 80's guy, I forgot to cure it.  My only regret is ... that I have ... boneitis!"
3, 53, "Fry", "He's dead."
3, 53, "Mom", "Pry out his fillings, feed him to the jackals and let's get on with the sale."
3, 53, "Fry", "I don't think so. 'Cause, as vice chairman of the company, I gain voting control of his shares."
3, 53, "Mom", "Don't be a fool, you idiot!"
3, 53, "Fry", "I'll be whatever I wanna do! That Guy was the greatest businessman that ever lived. And before his mysterious death, he taught me everything he knew.  But some things I had to learn myself.  I learned that money is fine but in the end what counts is people ...  ... people you love.  You can't put a price on that.  So I'm giving up control of the company ...  ... to a man of enormous experience ...  ... Professor ...  ... Hubert Farnsworth."
3, 53, "Farnsworth", "Oh, uh, what? I'm awake, I'm awake!"
3, 53, "Bender", "Fry! Stop doing the right thing, you jerk!"
3, 53, "Leela", "Let Mom buy the company! We all wanna be filthy, stinking rich!"
3, 53, "Zoidberg", "Trust me, two out of three doesn't cut it!"
3, 53, "Fry", "You mean you'd rather be rich than work together?"
3, 53, "Leela", "Hell, yeah!"
3, 53, "Fry", "In my whole life, this company was the only place I'd ever really felt at home. If being millionaires is more important to you than our--"
3, 53, "Bender", "It is!"
3, 53, "Fry", "Friendship, then I'll sell Planet Express, for you."
3, 53, "Hattie", """Millionaires"" nothing! The stock's only worth three kajiggers!"
3, 53, "Bender", "Oh, come on!"
3, 53, "Hermes", "My Jah! It's worth less now than when it was worthless!"
3, 53, "Fry", "It is? Yahoo! We're poor no matter what I do! The deal is off!"
3, 53, "Zoidberg", "Aha! Once again the conservative sangwich-heavy portfolio pays off for the hungry investor!  Oh! I'm ruined.  Why? Why?"
3, 53, "Fry", "Look, so we're not millionaires. At least we all still get to work together."
3, 53, "Bender", "Shut your fat mouth!"
3, 53, "Fry", "See you guys Monday!"
3, 54, "Morbo", "Welcome back. Our next guest has been teaching the world to cook for over 20 years. But apparently my, uh, wife hasn't been listening."
3, 54, "Linda", "Oh, funny!"
3, 54, "Morbo", "I will destroy her!  And now, extend a formulaic greeting to master chef Elzar.  So, uh, Elzar, what will you be cooking for Morbo to devour with his mighty jaws?"
3, 54, "Elzar", "Morbo, I'm gonna whip you up a nice, unnameable horror from beyond, with mango chutney."
3, 54, "Morbo", "Pathetic humans, prepare to write down the recipe!"
3, 54, "Fry", "Hey, uh, what's with all the pots and pans? You building a wife?"
3, 54, "Bender", "Part of one. Meantime, I'm cooking up a tasty Sunday brunch for my best friends."
3, 54, "Fry", "Brunch. Right. I'd better warn-- tell-- warntell the others!"
3, 54, "Bender", "Okey-dokey!"
3, 54, "Hermes", "Ooh!"
3, 54, "Leela", "Nice!"
3, 54, "Farnsworth", "Yes, it's a perfect scale model of the universe's largest bottle. I put a tiny spaceship inside to keep it from being boring."
3, 54, "Zoidberg", "Oh!"
3, 54, "Farnsworth", "Get--!  For the last time, Zoidberg, look with your eyes, not with your claws."
3, 54, "Fry", "Brace yourselves. Bender is making us brunch."
3, 54, "Zoidberg", "Oh, boy!"
3, 54, "Farnsworth", "Oh, God! My tract!"
3, 54, "Fry", "He's so proud of his awful cooking. If we don't eat it he'll be crushed."
3, 54, "Leela", "Alright, don't panic. If we can get to the ship, we can fly north and hide under the polar icecaps for a few weeks."
3, 54, "Fry", "Hurry!"
3, 54, "Farnsworth", "Good idea!"
3, 54, "Zoidberg", "What's the hold-up?"
3, 54, "Bender", "Fleeing somewhere?"
3, 54, "Fry", "With you blocking the only escape route? Don't be silly."
3, 54, "Bender", "In that case brunch is served! Let's go! Move it out! Stop crying, Leela!"
3, 54, "Farnsworth", "Zoidberg, are you coming?"
3, 54, "Zoidberg", "Sure. Me."
3, 54, "Farnsworth", "Because I don't want you touching that thing."
3, 54, "Zoidberg", "I know that.  Surrender your mysteries to Zoidberg!  Oh, no! Professor will hit me. But if Zoidberg fixes it, then perhaps gifts! [He picks up some ""Strong Force Krazy Glue"" but squeezes the bottle too soon and the glue squirts all over him. He screams and steps back. He turns around and some lab equipment and a sign reading ""Zoidberg"
3, 54, "Bender", "Today, I've personalised each of your meals. For example, Amy, you're cute, so I baked you a pony.  Come on! Eat! I slaved all day over a filthy stove."
3, 54, "Hermes", "This is terrible!"
3, 54, "Farnsworth", "Good thing I secretly installed this wormhole in the table."
3, 54, "Amy", "Where does the other end come out?"
3, 54, "Farnsworth", "You know, I'm not quite sure.  Oh, dear me!"
3, 54, "Bender", "The pie is ready. You guys like swarms of things, right?"
3, 54, "Zoidberg", "Casual hello. It's me, Zoidberg. Act naturally.  Ow! Ouch! Get off of me! Stop!"
3, 54, "Leela", "How interesting, Dr. Zoidberg. Do go on."
3, 54, "Bender", "Hey, check out the palm tree! It only gets sick when I cook brunch! How's that for a coincidence, Professor? With all your precious science!"
3, 54, "Fry", "Man, I don't wanna hurt Bender's feelings..."
3, 54, "Fry", "But this food actually tastes better as vomit!"
3, 54, "Leela", "It's unbearable! How much do you think it would cost to get my tongue removed?"
3, 54, "Bender", "And this time I mean it."
3, 54, "Bender", "Aw, who am I kidding? It was stupid of me to ever dream of becoming a chef. I don't have what it takes and nothing can change that.  Then it's settled! Elzar will teach me to cook!"
3, 54, "Elzar", "Absolutely not."
3, 54, "Bender", "But I watch your show. You owe me!"
3, 54, "Elzar", "I owe you nothing! For starter's, your antenna's in my crotch. Also, I hate you. Finally, you can't cook for squat."
3, 54, "Bender", "What was the first one again?"
3, 54, "Elzar", "I hate you."
3, 54, "Bender", "I thought that was number two."
3, 54, "Elzar", "I knocked it up a notch. Bam!"
3, 54, "Zoidberg", "Aw, I'll never recombobulate this ship! When the Professor finds out, he'll tear me a new cloaca.  Wait! What would the robot do?  Frame someone!"
3, 54, "Fry", "What up?"
3, 54, "Fry", "I'm walking on sunshine!  Sunshine!"
3, 54, "Bender", "It's over! My dream of being a chef is deader than the cat I'm sitting on!"
3, 54, "Dandy Jim", "Gus, old chum, let's give a friendly welcome to this new robo."
3, 54, "Bender", "What did you call me?"
3, 54, "Gus", "A robo. You know? A robot-hobo."
3, 54, "Bender", "Oh, OK. I thought you said ""romo""."
3, 54, "Dandy Jim", "No offence intended, my filthy friend. In fact, why not join us and ride the space rails?"
3, 54, "Gus", "Get ready. We's gonna jump off at that switching prism up ahead."
3, 54, "Dandy Jim", "We're going nearly the speed of light so, uh, roll when you land."
3, 54, "Bender", "Ow."
3, 54, "Gus", "Welcome to Bumbase Alpha, the biggest hobo jungle in the quadrant."
3, 54, "Bender", "I've seen bigger. Oh, wait, I'm thinking of Eugene, Oregon.  Wait. A pie with hobo-lifting aroma? Who baked it?"
3, 54, "Gus", "Helmut Spargle. He used to be the greatest chef ever."
3, 54, "Dandy Jim", "His restaurant was so high-toned, the only way to get reservations was to create a parallel universe where you already had reservations."
3, 54, "Gus", "Yep. I once ate there back when I what was a senator."
3, 54, "Bender", "Yo, Spargle. If you're such a great cook, how'd you end up in this dump?"
3, 54, "Spargle", "Ages ago I was the host of a TV show..."
3, 54, "Spargle", "Down Home Country Kitchen Mit Helmut Spargle. But one day the extreme soda company that sponsored the show decided it was too old-fashioned."
3, 54, "Man", "Spargle, you're fired! We need a chef who can attract today's younger more extreme cooking show viewer."
3, 54, "Spargle", "Elzar!"
3, 54, "Elzar", "Get lost, old man! Bam!"
3, 54, "Spargle", "Mein soufflé!"
3, 54, "Spargle", "Elzar had been seduced by the dark side of cooking. Cilantro, mango salsa, raspberry vinaigrette!"
3, 54, "Bender", "That twizzler!"
3, 54, "Spargle", "As for me, I went temporarily insane and vound up here, making pies out of shoes."
3, 54, "Bender", "My story's a lot like yours only more interesting 'cause it involves robots. That jerk Elzar ruined my dream of being a chef too."
3, 54, "Spargle", "Interesting. You wish to become a cook, but as a robot you have no sense of taste."
3, 54, "Bender", "It's so unfair! I have eight other senses, but I'd trade them all, even smission, to be able to taste."
3, 54, "Spargle", "You don't understand. Without the distraction of taste, your mind is free to touch the Zen of pure flavour. You could become the greatest chef ever."
3, 54, "Bender", "I could?"
3, 54, "Spargle", "Yes. Just as Beethoven was a great composer because he was deaf."
3, 54, "Bender", "Or like how Rembrandt was blind and had wooden hands."
3, 54, "Spargle", "Bender, hear me well. I shall train you. But first, you must forget everything you know about cooking."
3, 54, "Bender", "Done."
3, 54, "Farnsworth", "That's right, Ricardo. A ship in a bottle! What's that? Well hang on, I'll look."
3, 54, "Ricardo", "Ola? Professor? Qué pasa?"
3, 54, "Farnsworth", "I've gathered you all here in the accusing parlour because one of you is a miniature ship wrecker."
3, 54, "Zoidberg", "I'm acting astonished."
3, 54, "Farnsworth", "Certain clues suggest that the culprit is none other than our own ... Philip J. Fry!"
3, 54, "Fry", "What?"
3, 54, "Farnsworth", "Oh, it was a brilliant scheme. But you made one fatal mistake ... leaving this confession note."
3, 54, "Zoidberg", "Fry, you scoundrel!"
3, 54, "Fry", "Well, I don't remember any of that but I don't have the wherewithal to defend myself."
3, 54, "Farnsworth", "Then I have no choice but to charge you the full cost of the materials"
3, 54, "Fry", "There you go."
3, 54, "Zoidberg", "What have I done?"
3, 54, "Spargle", "Your training is complete, little dessert spoon. Now, just as the man who wishes to be world chess champion must win at least one game of chess, so must you serve at least one edible meal.  Succeed and I shall reveal to you the age-old secret  of perfect flavour."
3, 54, "Gus", "Ooh, yeah!"
3, 54, "Bender", "Slop's on!"
3, 54, "Gus", "Fine lookin' eats!"
3, 54, "Spargle", "It is ... acceptable."
3, 54, "Bender", "Yahoo! Another thing I'm great at! Wait. Why'd you stop eating, master?"
3, 54, "Spargle", "Because ... my stomach is about to explode."
3, 54, "Bender", "What? My dinner killed you? Oh, man!"
3, 54, "Spargle", "Oh, it hurts. But don't lose confidence. The important thing is that you defeat Elzar after I am gone.  And using this, you cannot fail."
3, 54, "Bender", "A diamond vial of Mrs. Dash?"
3, 54, "Spargle", "No. It is the essence of pure flavour. A few drops will cause the inner perfection of any dish to blossom forth.  Oh! There goes my ... life."
3, 54, "Bender", "I'll avenge you, master. I swear, in the presence of these drunken bums, that I shall defeat Elzar!"
3, 54, "Gus", "Oh, I'm not drunk, I'm mentally ill. But I likes what what you said!"
3, 54, "Bender", "Elzar, I'm a walking pile of your unfinished business!"
3, 54, "Elzar", "Why, you--"
3, 54, "Bender", "Helmut Spargle has a message for you. He says  ""Ooh, I'm dead!"""
3, 54, "Elzar", "Spargle, huh? What he do, bland himself to death?"
3, 54, "Bender", "No. He was eating some food I made and by a crazy coincidence his stomach exploded. Now I'm here to avenge him."
3, 54, "Elzar", "OK, but it seems like you're the one who killed him."
3, 54, "Bender", "Maybe so but you are his sworn enemy. I challenge you to a battle of the chefs."
3, 54, "Customer", "Scandalous!"
3, 54, "Elzar", "Very well. We'll meet on the ancient televised battleground of Kitchen Coliseum. Whosever meal is best will claim the title of Iron Cook."
3, 54, "Bender", "Iron Cook, eh? I can't lose. I'm 30% iron!  You're going down! Uh, also I had a reservation for one, under ""Dr. Bender""."
3, 54, "Hiroki", "Please welcome the superintendent of Kitchen Coliseum, Chairman Koji!  No robot chef has ever competed here but today one has barged his way in to challenge for the title of..."
3, 54, "Koji", "Iron Cookuru!"
3, 54, "Fry", "Yeah! You show 'em!"
3, 54, "Hiroki", "Let's meet today's celebrity judges"
3, 54, "Tate", "Konnichiwa, brother!"
3, 54, "Hiroki", "TV anchor-monster, Morbo."
3, 54, "Morbo", "Greetings, pathetic host."
3, 54, "Hiroki", "And a woman who ended a thousand-year galactic war with her apple dandies, Martha Stewart's head."
3, 54, "Stewart", "The secret is fresh pork."
3, 54, "Hiroki", "And now, Chairman Koji will present the theme ingredient to be used in every dish today."
3, 54, "Bender", "If it's chicken, chicken c la king; if it's fish, fish à la king; if it's turkey, fish à la king."
3, 54, "Koji", "Soylent Greuu!"
3, 54, "Hiroki", "Soylent Green, a classic ingredient of gourmet cooking. And the battle is on.  Aki, what's Elzar making?"
3, 54, "Aki", "Well, Hiroki-san, when I asked him, he asked what business it was of mine and conjectured that my mother was a prostitute."
3, 54, "Stewart", "In the English countryside many prostitutes decorate their rooms with festive gourds."
3, 54, "Female Announcer", "30 minutes to go."
3, 54, "Hiroki", "Look at Bender roll that dough!"
3, 54, "Tate", "I've never seen such confident, powerful strokes of the ass!"
3, 54, "Stewart", "You've never seen mine!"
3, 54, "Tate", "No, I haven't!"
3, 54, "Female Announcer", "Fifteen minutes remaining."
3, 54, "Hiroki", "The iron cook is bringing in his signature creation, a working pastry replica of downtown Venice."
3, 54, "Man", "Commemorative turkey basters. Get your commemorative turkey basters."
3, 54, "Fry", "Yo, hook me up. My turkey is dry and I've tried everything.  Oh, right. Never mind."
3, 54, "Zoidberg", "Oh, the guilt! The unbearable guilt!"
3, 54, "Female Announcer", "Fifteen seconds."
3, 54, "Elzar", "Bam!"
3, 54, "Female Announcer", "Ten seconds."
3, 54, "Bender", "Master Spargle, if you can hear me up there in that ditch where I left you, this is for you."
3, 54, "Koji", "Time uperuu!"
3, 54, "Hiroki", "The iron cook Neptunian has gone all out to please the judges. He's even garnished the salad with $100 bills. Let's see what they think."
3, 54, "Tate", "Mmm. Soylent green is my kind of people!"
3, 54, "Morbo", "Scrumptious. Morbo will store this in his sack for future digestion."
3, 54, "Stewart", "I'm swimming in my own soylent waste. It's a good thing."
3, 54, "Hiroki", "Next up, challenger Bender. A student of the legendary Helmut Spargle, Bender is some sort of wonderful mechanical man."
3, 54, "Stewart", "Ooh, delicious!"
3, 54, "Tate", "This food looks kind of funky, but it tastes kind of fun-kay!"
3, 54, "Morbo", "The challenger's ugly food has shown us that even hideous things can be sweet on the inside."
3, 54, "Hiroki", "And now, judgement. The winner will become the new iron cook, the loser is doomed to scrub.  Whose confection will achieve perfection? Whose foodstuff will be the good stuff?"
3, 54, "Koji", "Challengeruu Benderuu!"
3, 54, "Fry", "Yay!"
3, 54, "Farnsworth", "That's my robot! I own him!"
3, 54, "Bender", "You honour me, Chairman Koji."
3, 54, "Koji", "Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto."
3, 54, "Bender", "Chairman-san, I came here with one goal"
3, 54, "Elzar", "No question."
3, 54, "Bender", "But the true Zen of flavour is not found in a coliseum. It is found in a small kitchen, with friends. That is why I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept only the lesser title of ""Zinc Saucier"", which I just made up. Also, it comes with double prize money."
3, 54, "Zoidberg", "Wait! Everyone must know"
3, 54, "Koji", "Oh! That sword cost 5000 dolluu!"
3, 54, "Zoidberg", "Fry did it!"
3, 54, "Bender", "And that's how I defeated Elzar, thanks to Spargle's magic liquid."
3, 54, "Leela", "Yes, we were there. And we just finished watching it again on TV."
3, 54, "Farnsworth", "Hmm. Let me see that vial, Bender.  Good Lord! According to the spectrolizer, Spargle's magic ingredient was ... water. Ordinary water!"
3, 54, "Hermes", "No!"
3, 54, "Fry", "Ah, so the real gift Spargle gave you was confidence. The confidence to be your best."
3, 54, "Farnsworth", "Yes, ordinary water. Laced with nothing more than a few spoonfuls of LSD."
3, 54, "Bender", "The important thing is, by my standards, I won fair and square. Now, who wants brunch? Cooked with plenty of ... ""confidence""?"
3, 54, "Leela", "I'm in!"
3, 54, "Farnsworth", "I do!"
