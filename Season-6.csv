6, 89, "Bender", "On the count of three, you will awaken feeling refreshed, as if Futurama had never been cancelled by idiots, then brought back by bigger idiots. 1... 2... ."
6, 89, "Bender", "This has been a test of the Emergency Hypnotoad System.  Had this been an actual hypnosis, you would go limp and watch whatever crap comes on next.  Comin' up next"
6, 89, "Fry", "Professor, my Fry-fro's all frizzy."
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "OK."
6, 89, "Fry", "That's all.   Oh, also; I'm covered with severe burns."
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "So!?  What of it?"
6, 89, "Fry", "Well, why is– those things?"
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "You mean you don't remember?"
6, 89, "Fry", "Nope, nothing. It's like when I passed out in college, except no one drew magic marker penises on my forehead."
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "Well, I suppose it's for the best, considering the unbearable horrors you've endured. Let's never speak of it again.  It all began a few days ago. We were interstellar fugitives on the run from the law."
6, 89, "Zapp", "Fire all weapons and open a hailing frequency for my victory yodel."
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "And so, as you and Leela kissed goodbye in a tender display of toungesmanship, we plunged into a massive wormhole. Never to be seen again."
6, 89, "Bender", "Yeah, we're back."
6, 89, "Hermes", "Sweet coincidence of Port-au-Prince, we're back at Earth!"
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "Of course, that was the Panama Wormhole, Earth's central channel for shipping!"
6, 89, "Zoidberg", "How humorous."
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "Yes! It's sort of a Comedy Central channel, and we're on it now!"
6, 89, "Amy", "I get it!"
6, 89, "Fry", "We've lost power to the forward Game Boy, Mario not responding!"
6, 89, "Leela", "Brace for emergency landing!"
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "Rodger that, activate Safety Spheres!  Also mine has air conditioning."
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "Yet, thanks to my trusty safety sphere, I surblibed with only tribial bray dablage."
6, 89, "Fry", "And the others?"
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "Right here behind this horror cloth."
6, 89, "Fry", "Are they dead?"
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "Oh, no no no, much worse."
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "Move over God! Prepare for rebirth!  Wrong switch."
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "Come on, stem cells. Work your astounding scientific nonsense!"
6, 89, "Fry", "Fetal steam cells? Aren't those controversial?"
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "In your time yes, but nowadays, shut up! Besides, these are adult stem cells harvested from perfectly healthy adults, whom I killed for their stem cells."
6, 89, "Fry", "Hermes Conrad!"
6, 89, "Hermes", "Oh, mon! I'm dripping with placenta! Good thing it's Casual Friday."
6, 89, "Fry", "Amy Wong!"
6, 89, "Amy", "Oh, baby soft!"
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "Indeed.Hermes"
6, 89, "Hermes", "Dr. Zoidberg!"
6, 89, "Zoidberg", "Hermes, my friend! Let me cut off your umbilical cord.  Oops."
6, 89, "Fry", "And the rest!"
6, 89, "Amy", "Hooray, we're back in business!"
6, 89, "Zapp", "Over my dead body.  Uh, never mind."
6, 89, "Fry", "Bender! Are the steam cells working?"
6, 89, "Bender", "I'm dying. I need mouth to ass resuscitation."
6, 89, "Fry", "I'm on it!  It's not working!"
6, 89, "Bender", "I die happy knowing you fell for that."
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "His power supply is shot! He is flatlining!  Only one thing can keep him alive.  Possibly this thing."
6, 89, "Bender", "Woo! I've never felt so energetic!"
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "That's because the doomsday device I shoved all up in you puts out 50 gigawatts. That's ten times your recommended--"
6, 89, "Bender", "Who are you? My warranty?"
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "For God's sake, Bender! Keep dancing, keep whooping it up!  You must burn off the doomsday energy as fast as it produces, or it will build to critical levels."
6, 89, "Bender", "You don't mean..."
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "Oh, but I do. If you stop partying for a single second, you'll explode and kill everyone here in a fireball of melting gears and splattered bowels."
6, 89, "Bender", "Sounds like a party, baby!"
6, 89, "Fry", "Hey! Speaking of splattered bowels, can I cook you a romantic dinner tonight, Leela?... Where's Leela?  Is she okay? Why hasn't she acknowledged my dinner offer?"
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "Something's wrong! She's not responding to my poking stick."
6, 89, "Fry", "Poke harder, damn it!"
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "I'm poking as hard as I can! I'm sorry, Fry,  but I'm afraid Leela is in an irreversible coma."
6, 89, "Bender", "Coma, coma, coma, coma, coma, chameleon!"
6, 89, "Fry", "My soul mate is gone. Why should I go on living?"
6, 89, "Bender", "Because the pain slowly fades but the love is forever."
6, 89, "Fry", "But, what if I forget the sweet sound of her voice or the moist touch of her eyeball on my lips?"
6, 89, "Bender", "Aw! Are you still hung up on Whatshername? Move on already!"
6, 89, "Fry", "Maybe you're right."
6, 89, "Bender", "Maybe I'm always right."
6, 89, "Fry", "Build-A-Bot Workshop? It's time to start living again!"
6, 89, "Fry", "At least it's something to distract me from Leela.  Nah.  Now that I like for some reason."
6, 89, "Robot Leela", "I like jellybeans. Do you?"
6, 89, "Fry", "I sure do, honey."
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "Come now, Fry!  You can't live out this sick fantasy!  Not without our help."
6, 89, "Hermes", "These security tapes record everything at Planet Express. Including the ship, shower, and urinals.Amy"
6, 89, "Amy", "And yet, it still hasn't stopped the elusive bathroom burglar."
6, 89, "Zoidberg", "Maybe he's just trying to feed his family."
6, 89, "Hermes", "Computer, analyze tapes and extract personality profile of one Turanga Leela."
6, 89, "Computer", "Analyzing...analyzing...Checking my eBay bid.  Dammit. Analysis complete."
6, 89, "Fry", "Hey, I was nuzzling that!Computer"
6, 89, "Computer", "Attributes transferred...Shoe size 12...etc."
6, 89, "Robot Leela", "Brace for emergency landing! What? We survived the crash? Oh, Fry!"
6, 89, "Bender", "Party people in the house say,"
6, 89, "Robot Leela", "This is wonderful! The last thing I remember I was dying in an explosion. Yet here I am in the flesh more alive than ever!"
6, 89, "Fry", "Alive?"
6, 89, "Hermes", "You better tell her, Fry."
6, 89, "Robot Leela", "Tell me what?"
6, 89, "Hermes", "Anyway, my work is done. I'm gonna hit the showers."
6, 89, "Robot Leela", "Nibbler, come give mama a hug!  Ow! What the—?! Bad Nibbler! Bad Nibbler!  What are you doing, pooperdoodle? It's me, Leela.[Montage"
6, 89, "Robot Leela", "Am I really just a robot? I mean, I have Leela's memories!  Her opinion of gazelles! (Majestic.)  Her emotions! (Confused and hurt.)"
6, 89, "Fry", "I swear.  I didn't know this would happen.  The only thing I truly know is I love you.  I mean her—Wait, help me out here."
6, 89, "Bender", "Do the Bender! Do the Bender!"
6, 89, "Randy", "No thank you."
6, 89, "Bender", "I said, ""Do it!""[Cut to"
6, 89, "Robot Leela", "The truth is, Fry, I still have feelings for you.  But are they really my feelings? Am I just an automaton or can a machine of sufficient complexity legitimately achieve consciousness?"
6, 89, "Fry", "I agree."
6, 89, "Robot Leela", "I need some time to figure this out.  Until then,  friends?"
6, 89, "Fry", "Okay."
6, 89, "Bender", "Listen up, disco dummies, you just flunked outta Bender's College for Party Knowledge!"
6, 89, "Bender", "Do the back dance! Do the back dance! Ooh...."
6, 89, "Farnsworth (v.o.)", "Good news, everyone...[Scene"
6, 89, "Farnsworth (cont'd)", "I'm going to make one final attempt to awaken Leela.  After all, there's always hope."
6, 89, "Fry", "Really?"
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "No, don't get your hopes up. Frankly, she's just a brainless mound of scabs and pus."
6, 89, "Fry", "Oh! I didn't need to hear that."
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "No, and you don't need to see this."
6, 89, "Machine", "Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!"
6, 89, "Machine", "Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!!!! WAKE UP!!!!!!!!!!!"
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "Well, that's it. I'm afraid traditional medicine has failed."
6, 89, "Fry", "No!  I refuse to give up! Wake up, Leela!  I! Love! You!"
6, 89, "Robot Leela", "Fry, stop. She's gone."
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "Dr. Zoidberg, can you note the time and declare the patient legally dead?"
6, 89, "Zoidberg", "Can I? That's my specialty."
6, 89, "Hermes", "As you all know, Leela's living will states that in the event of coma, her body is to be fed to the wild Cyclophage, a highly endangered creature that eats only cyclopses."
6, 89, "Bender", "Yep, that's what her donor card says."
6, 89, "Fry", "Goodbye, my love."
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "The beast aproacheth."
6, 89, "Bender", "To the beat y'all! To the beat y'all! I'm dancin' a jig wid ma feets y'all!"
6, 89, "Amy (whispering)", "Bender, cut it out! People are trying to have emotions!"
6, 89, "Bender (angry)", "You think I wanna party?  I'm sick of partying!  Woohoo! More partying!"
6, 89, "Leela", "Bender, shut the hell up!"
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "Bender, stop shutting the hell up!"
6, 89, "Bender", "Oh, right.  Leela's back. As if I care. Woo."
6, 89, "Leela", "Thanks. It's so nice to wake up and see—"
6, 89, "Fry", "Leela?!"
6, 89, "Robot Leela", "Leela?"
6, 89, "Leela", "Leela?"
6, 89, "Hermes", "Leela."
6, 89, "Leela", "How is this possible? And can you believe she wore a tank top to my funeral?"
6, 89, "Robot Leela", "Shut up!  We gotta get outta here!"
6, 89, "Leela", "No, you ""Shut up! We gotta get outta here!""Bender"
6, 89, "Bender", "Ooh, yeah, baby, come on!"
6, 89, "Bender", "All aboard the party ship![Cut to"
6, 89, "Leela", "There's no room for two captains' butts in this chair!"
6, 89, "Robot Leela", "There would be if you'd taken a spin class instead of lounging around in a coma!"
6, 89, "Leela (v.o.)", "This is crazy."
6, 89, "Leela", "It's like I'm looking at an exact robot duplicate of myself."
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "That is what you're looking at."
6, 89, "Leela", "Oh.  How could you do this, Fry?"
6, 89, "Fry", "Uh, coma. Sad."
6, 89, "Robot Leela", "I have to go!  This is just too freaky!"
6, 89, "Fry", "Don't get upset, Leela.  She's nothing like you."
6, 89, "Leela", "I have to go!  This is just too freaky!"
6, 89, "Fry", "I need cheering up, Bender.  I dunno.  You wanna go out and party tonight?"
6, 89, "Bender", "I hate partying!  If only I didn't have so much crunk in my badunkadunk!  Ooh, yeah! Come on, babe!"
6, 89, "Fry (sighing)", "Why does everything I date run away?  I love Leela, always and forever.  And if I loved Robot Leela, too..."
6, 89, "Fry (cont'd)", "...well, that's only 'cause she had so much of real Leela in her.  I thought she loved me, too, but, obviously, I was wrong as usual."
6, 89, "Leela", "Wrong again.  You were right."
6, 89, "Fry", "Leela?  Leela Leela?"
6, 89, "Leela", "Leela Leela.  I've been thinking, Fry, if I lost you, I don't think I could stand it, either.  I'd probably build a copy of you, too.  As long as Robo-Leela's not a jealous type like me, thing will wor—"
6, 89, "Robot Leela", "I'll kill you, you slut-clops!  Hee-ya!  He's mine!"
6, 89, "Leela", "Oh, back off, missy!"
6, 89, "Amy", "Somebody do something!  Here, take this."
6, 89, "Fry", "A gun?!  D-Do I really need to—?"
6, 89, "Leela", "Shoot her!  She's the robot!"
6, 89, "Robot Leela", "No, shoot her!  She's the human!"
6, 89, "Fry", "But-But how do I know who's the human and who's the robot?"
6, 89, "Leela", "We just told you!"
6, 89, "Robot Leela", "Yeah, you idiot!"
6, 89, "Fry", "Okay. Fine. If you're gonna be like that, I'm not shooting anyone.  Whoa! Right between the lungs. Man, that was close."
6, 89, "Fry (gasps)", "I'm a robot, too!"
6, 89, "Zoidberg", "Aha!  That explains this growth on your drive shaft."
6, 89, "Robot Fry", "But how is this possible?"
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "Who knows?  Oh, I do.  Allow me to explain what really happened the day the ship crashed."
6, 89, "Fry", "I'll protect you, Leela!  My love is stronger than the vast majority of explosions!"
6, 89, "Farnsworth (v.o.)", "Fry did in fact save Leela, though at a terrible cost to himself.  I tossed him into the stem cells but he just bubbled away like phlegm on a hot sidewalk.Farnsworth (v.o.)"
6, 89, "Farnsworth (v.o.)", "Leela was so upset, she went all Blade Runner and built a duplicate..."
6, 89, "Farnsworth (v.o)", "...then uploaded his personality from the urinal surveillance tapes."
6, 89, "Fry", "I sure love Leela."
6, 89, "Farnsworth (v.o.)", "Alas, in recreating Fry's adorable jelly belly, she had overstuffed him with copper wadding."
6, 89, "Farnsworth (v.o.)", "The inevitable static discharged electrocuted Leela and destroyed both of their short-term memories."
6, 89, "Robot Fry", "So that's why I'm so amazed by these things I already knew."
6, 89, "Farnsworth (v.o.)", "What could I do?  I hung up Leela with the other bone bags and went to procure the final ingredient for my stem cell brew."
6, 89, "Robot Fry", "Professor, my Fry-fro's all frizzy."
6, 89, "Leela", "My god, I can't believe I'll never see that particular Fry again."
6, 89, "Fry", "Hey, where's my shoes?"
6, 89, "Robot Fry", "Fry!"
6, 89, "Fry", "Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was already here. Wait, what's with all the Leelas?"
6, 89, "Robot Fry", "Trust me, don't ask."
6, 89, "Fry", "Okay, dork. Listen, I'm gonna hit the urinal, maybe talk about myself a little bit, then—"
6, 89, "Robot Leela", "Hang on!  It's time to sort things out.  The truth is I love Fry.  That Fry."
6, 89, "Robot Fry", "And I love Leela.  Any Leela."
6, 89, "Robot Leela", "We're robots and we're in love. Let's ditch these meat jackets."
6, 89, "Robot Fry", "Whoa, cool!"
6, 89, "Robot Fry", "Hasta la vista, wiener!"
6, 89, "Robot Leela", "We'll be back...for our stuff."
6, 89, "Amy", "Why did their voices change?"
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "That's the one thing we'll never truly understand."
6, 89, "Fry", "Uh, this is a bit awkward.  Or is it?"
6, 89, "Leela", "I'm not sure. I lost track around the second robot."
6, 89, "Fry", "Well, you know how I feel.  I waited for you for a thousand years.  I can wait a little longer."
6, 89, "Bender", "Pffft!  What a load of mush!  I've had it!"
6, 89, "Amy (gasps)", "He's gonna blow!"
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "Party, Bender!  Party for your life!"
6, 89, "Bender", "No chance, hot pants!  I'd rather die and kill all of you than party for one more millisecond!"
6, 89, "Leela", "The cyclops eater!"
6, 89, "Bender", "Hold on, mac!  It ain't like that!"
6, 89, "Bender", "Geez, what's it take to kill me?"
6, 89, "Farnsworth", "Bender, you blew out your excess capacity!  You're cured!"
6, 89, "Bender", "Oh, sweet mercy.  My hellish nightmare is over. I never have to party again."
6, 89, "Fry", "Well, that's that, then.  We're back, everyone!"
6, 89, "Bender", "Party!!"
6, 89, "Zapp", "Wheeee!"
6, 90, "Transition Announcer", "And now, The Transcredible Exploits of Zapp Brannigan!  Brought to you by Bartley's Rocket Wax."
6, 90, "Zapp", "I wax my rocket every day."
6, 90, "Emperor Chop Chop", "No one can save you now, Leela."
6, 90, "Leela Actress", "Well, what about Zapp Brannigan?"
6, 90, "Emperor Chop Chop", "Well, obviously, Zapp Brannigan can save you, but—  Zapp Brannigan!"
6, 90, "Zapp", "So, Emperor Chop Chop, once again we meet at last! Drop that space gun or I'll shoot!  Like so!"
6, 90, "Leela Actress", "Oh, Zapp!  Tie me back up and ravish me!"
6, 90, "Zapp", "I'd like to, Leela.  So I will."
6, 90, "Zapp", "Ooh, yeah, shake it, baby. Shake it like—   I surrender and volunteer for treason!"
6, 90, "Kif", "Emergency summons from the President, captain."
6, 90, "Zapp", "Oh, it's you.  Just let me freshen up.  Computer, captain's musk."
6, 90, "Zapp", "The long dramatic corridor.  That's never a good sign."
6, 90, "Scanner", "Glove recognized. Proceed, Mrs. Eisenhower.Zapp"
6, 90, "Zapp", "Mr. President, what the hell?"
6, 90, "Nixon", "At ease, Brannigan."
6, 90, "Nixon", "What you're about to see is highly classified. Reptillicus, hit the thingy."
6, 90, "Nixon", "At 0000 hours, Planet XXX was attacked by a mysterious death sphere."
6, 90, "Zapp", "Magnify that death sphere.  Why's it still blurry?"
6, 90, "Kif", "That's all the resolution we have. Making it bigger doesn't make it clearer."
6, 90, "Zapp", "It does on CSI"
6, 90, "Nixon", "They fought back with advance military hardware, but it was like shooting BB's at Bebe Rebozo."
6, 90, "Zapp", "That poor brave hardware."
6, 90, "Nixon", "The sphere then fired some kind of hellish blackout ray.  Erased that planet like eighteen minutes of incriminating tape."
6, 90, "Zapp", "Oh, I just wish I understood why.  Why I should care."
6, 90, "Nixon", "Because the death sphere is now on course for Earth! Rowrowooooooo!!"
6, 90, "Zapp", "My god, we're defenseless. Like fish in a barrel."
6, 90, "Nixon", "Options?"
6, 90, "Zapp", "My instinct is to hide in this barrel.  Like the wily fish."
6, 90, "Nixon", "Then we're down to our last hope.  A radical new weapon built by a visionary scientist I once dismissed as crazy."
6, 90, "Farnsworth", "Let's see how crazy I am now, Nixon!  The correct answer is"
6, 90, "Nixon", "Alright, Professor. Sock it to me!"
6, 90, "Farnsworth", "Top secret news, everyone! I've developed a tiny one-man stealth fighter that's virtually undetectable."
6, 90, "Zapp", "How undetectable?"
6, 90, "Farnsworth", "It's right in front of you."
6, 90, "Zapp", "I find that—OW! —to believe."
6, 90, "Bender", "But how exactly is this Happy Meal toy gonna destroy a giant death sphere?"
6, 90, "Farnsworth", "From within.  This ship should be able to sneak undetected through the sphere's one vulnerable opening."
6, 90, "Hermes", "What vulnerable opening?"
6, 90, "Farnsworth", "All death spheres have one vulnerable opening."
6, 90, "Zoidberg", "Well, sure, but who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a ""death sphere""?"
6, 90, "NIxon", "I say Brannigan."
6, 90, "Zapp", "I say no."
6, 90, "Leela", "I say me."
6, 90, "Nixon", "I say Leela."
6, 90, "Leela", "I say yes."
6, 90, "Fry", "I say no."
6, 90, "Zapp", "I say Leela, too."
6, 90, "Leela", "I say yes again."
6, 90, "Zapp", "I say I shall join her."
6, 90, "Leela", "But it's only a one-man craft...I say."
6, 90, "Zapp", "There'll only be one man.  Me.  How would you feel if I rode rear as your personal tail gunner?"
6, 90, "Leela", "Creeped out."
6, 90, "Zapp", "Then it's decided."
6, 90, "Leela", "Are you sure I have to sit in your lap?"
6, 90, "Zapp", "It'll help us achieve maximum thrust."
6, 90, "Fry", "I made you some trail mix for the flight.  Also this picture to remember me by."
6, 90, "Leela", "You hold on to it.  I'll be back soon."
6, 90, "Farnsworth", "Activate stealth shielding."
6, 90, "Leela", "Liftoff!"
6, 90, "Zapp", "I'll rodger that."
6, 90, "Fry", "Did anyone else feel aroused and jealous and worried?"
6, 90, "Bender", "I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died."
6, 90, "Leela", "Death sphere in range.  Engaging holographic targeting.   Activating the Force."
6, 90, "The Force", "Feel the entrance, Leela. Destination on your left in...  zero point three  miles."
6, 90, "Zapp", "Zapp to Leela"
6, 90, "Leela", "We better whisper."
6, 90, "Zapp", "Switching to pillow talk mode."
6, 90, "Leela", "Look.  What are those huge letters?"
6, 90, "Zapp", """V-GINY?"" Doesn't ring a bell."
6, 90, "Farnsworth (v.o.)", "Hmmm...."
6, 90, "Farnsworth", "I don't like the looks of this ""V-GINY.""  Does anyone recognize those call letters?"
6, 90, "Hermes", "Nope.  It's not in the Janeway's Guide either."
6, 90, "Farnsworth", "Deciphering that ID code is critical.  I'll be in the Chamber of Understanding."
6, 90, "Leela", "This is it! The moment we should've trained for!"
6, 90, "Leela", "Holy cr—"
6, 90, "Zapp", "Incoming yucky!"
6, 90, "Leela", "Firing pocket rocket!"
6, 90, "Zapp", "Don't panic, Leela! Go go go go go!"
6, 90, "Leela", "I hope this is the control stick!"
6, 90, "Zapp", "Captain's Log"
6, 90, "Transition Announcer", "And now, back to The Transcredible Exploits of Zapp Brannigan!"
6, 90, "Zapp", "Chapter Two"
6, 90, "Zapp", "Leela, wake up! I can't face this mysterious planet alone without you or someone like you."
6, 90, "Leela", "Zapp?  Zapp, wake up!"
6, 90, "Zapp", "Leela? Where are we."
6, 90, "Leela", "We crashed on an uncharted planet.  When I woke up, I was pinned under this tree. Can you help me?"
6, 90, "Zapp", "If anyone can move it, I can.  No one can move it. Are you hurt?"
6, 90, "Leela", "No. But I'm so thirsty.  This spacesuit is making me sweat like a sow."
6, 90, "Zapp", "Me, too. We better strip them off and continue surviving au naturel."
6, 90, "Leela", "Uh, I suppose so."
6, 90, "Zapp", "Here.  We can cover ourselves with these sticky sap-covered leaves.  I'll try to avert my eyes from your nudery."
6, 90, "Leela", "You will?  Eh, what's the point? You'll have to look sooner or later."
6, 90, "Zapp", "Well, I promise not to abuse the privilege. For now, I better scout around for food and water and help."
6, 90, "Leela", "What a thoughtful and considerate thing to say.  What the hell's wrong with you?"
6, 90, "Zapp", "I'm not quite sure. Perhaps it's the fresh air or a severe head injury.  In any case, I'm off."
6, 90, "Leela", "If you see any steaks, that'd be good!"
6, 90, "Fry", "Why isn't Leela back yet?  Do you think she's okay?"
6, 90, "Bender", "How should I know?  And how come you never ask if I'm okay?  I'm feelin' a little neglected here!"
6, 90, "Fry", "Oh, sorry. Are you okay, Bender?"
6, 90, "Bender", "Shut up!"
6, 90, "Hermes", "What difference does it make?  When that death sphere gets to Earth, we'll all be blown to Manwich meat!"
6, 90, "Amy", "Well, I guess it's time to indulge in some end-of-the-world debauchery.  Who's up for an orgy?"
6, 90, "Zoidberg", "Maybe a Parcheesi tournament."
6, 90, "Farnsworth", "Belay that Parcheesi tournament! I've identified the death sphere! We may yet have a faint hope of survival!"
6, 90, "Zoidberg", "Still, a Parcheesi tournament."
6, 90, "Farnsworth", "This is a top secret military satellite launched by the Air Force in 1998."
6, 90, "Farnsworth (cont'd)", "And this is a top secret FCC satellite launched that same year to censor indecent TV programs."
6, 90, "Bender", "Like The Pimpsons? And Assarama?"
6, 90, "Farnsworth", "Precisely.  However, the satellites collided shortly after launch and were never heard from again."
6, 90, "Zoidberg", "I found the board!"
6, 90, "Farnsworth", "Now, I've simulated that collision using Shrapnovision(?)."
6, 90, "Fry", "Granted, all that makes perfect sense, but why is this death sphere destroying planets?"
6, 90, "Farnsworth", "That makes the most sense of all.  Look at the planets it's destroyed so far.  First came XXX, the nude beach planet.  Then Poopiter.  /* <!.getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */$!#%&"" comes on screen.] And finally that world that can't be mentioned in polite company."
6, 90, "Fry", "You mean..."
6, 90, "Amy", "Aw!"
6, 90, "Farnsworth", "How dare you!?"
6, 90, "Amy", "Shame on—"
6, 90, "Hermes", "So the death sphere is ""censoring"" indecent planets?"
6, 90, "Farnsworth", "Indeed.  And we're next if we can't keep it in our collective pants!  Our sole hope is to persuade the people of Earth to abandon their smutty ways."
6, 90, "Amy", "So the orgy's off?"
6, 90, "Leela", "So thirsty.  Why couldn't a water fountain have fallen on me?"
6, 90, "Zapp", "I couldn't find any water.  But the moisture in these fruit and nut berries should sustain you."
6, 90, "Leela", "Thank you."
6, 90, "Zapp", "I climbed perilously high into the trees to pick them, yet I saw no sign of intelligent life."
6, 90, "Leela", "Bummer."
6, 90, "Zapp", "Moreover, the crash totally destroyed our ship."
6, 90, "Leela", "So we're stuck here until someone finds us?"
6, 90, "Zapp", "Alas, that may never happen.  Stealth technology makes the ship impossible to locate yet easy to stub your crotch on."
6, 90, "Leela", "Well, there's worse places to be marooned.  Plenty of food, mild climate."
6, 90, "Zapp", "It's a veritable Garden of Eden."
6, 90, "Leela", "It is?"
6, 90, "Snake", "Hello."
6, 90, "Leela", "Did that snake say, ""Hello""?"
6, 90, "Zapp", "No, we're both delirious from dehydration."
6, 90, "Snake", "Just like Adam and Eve."
6, 90, "Farnsworth (v.o.)", "We can still save Earth.  People are sure to clean up their act when presented with cold hard facts by rational folks like us."
6, 90, "Farnsworth", "The end is near! Repent thy sins!"
6, 90, "Sal", "I'll thinks it overs while I engages this five dollar hooker."
6, 90, "Fry", "Don't do it! It's not worth it!"
6, 90, "Petunia", "Okay, make it three dollars."
6, 90, "Sal", "Yuck! I don't wants no three-dollar hooker.  I'm goin' backs to the adults bookstore."
6, 90, "Fry", "Adult bookstore?  I thought this was the public library."
6, 90, "Bender", "Nope, pubic library."
6, 90, "Leela", "Zapp?  Where are you?  Oh, God, I'm actually starting to miss him."
6, 90, "Snake", "Maybe you two belong together."
6, 90, "Leela", "We do not.  And you can't talk."
6, 90, "Snake", "Oh, come on!  It must be an awful temptation. Zapp"
6, 90, "Zapp", "Guess who just killed a woodchuck with his bare feet?  I thought I'd whip us up some shelter, make this a little more like home."
6, 90, "Leela", "I do miss the Earth terribly.  I wonder if it's even still there."
6, 90, "Zapp", "Let's find out together.  I'll brave the ship's wreckage to fetch you the telescope."
6, 90, "Leela", "That's so sweet."
6, 90, "Snake", "I'm just sayin' is all."
6, 90, "Farnsworth", "I know my new plan is a long shot, but it's the only hope left."
6, 90, "Hermes", "Well, now I've heard everything  on my eyePod.  So, do you have a new plan, Professor, and is there any hope left?"
6, 90, "Farnsworth", "Indeed.  We're here on Earth's last unspoiled acre to show the death sphere there's still purity in the world.  Begin transmitting."
6, 90, "Farnsworth", "Commence purity chant."
6, 90, "Fry", "Hey, I'm proud of you, Bender. Avoiding sin for almost a full minute.   Bender?"
6, 90, "Bender (v.o.)", "Aw, yeah, baby. You're quite a dish.Farnsworth"
6, 90, "Farnsworth", "Bender, stop!! STOP!!"
6, 90, "Bender", "Aw, quiet, you riot.  What's the worst that could happen?"
6, 90, "Leela (v.o.)", "No!"
6, 90, "Leela", "No!  Earth is gone!  We're the only two humans left in the universe!"
6, 90, "Zapp", "Oh, God, I'm sorry, Leela."
6, 90, "Leela", "Maybe — Maybe this was meant to be. Maybe you and I were meant to build a new world here."
6, 90, "Zapp", "We can avoid humanity's mistakes."
6, 90, "Leela", "Like the tuba."
6, 90, "Zapp", "Yes.  We'll be like Adam and Eve."
6, 90, "Leela", "Only without the tuba."
6, 90, "Zapp", "And we'll beget little Zapp Jr. and Leela Jr. and they'll have kids of their ow—Yecch!  Is that really what happened in the Bible?!"
6, 90, "Leela", "It's a sick and twisted book of holiness all right."
6, 90, "Zapp", "Then we'll write our own Bible, with less Sodom and more Gomorra."
6, 90, "Leela", "Let's do it.  I shall become the mother of a new world, trapped here under this tree.  The Tree of Knowledge!  Look, it even has apples!  Ow!  Wow!  Come here, Adam, partake of my forbidden fruit."
6, 90, "Zapp", "Thee will be done."
6, 90, "Leela", "Wait!  One more bite before we begin the begetting.   Mmm, juicy.  Those nut berries you found were so salty, I—I couldn't think straight.  I mean, not to belabor it, but they were as salty as that bag of trail mix Fry gave me.  Exactly as salty.  Hey!  Wait a second!"
6, 90, "Zapp", "Uh...woh...ih...Giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiih—I have a terrible confession to make!"
6, 90, "Zapp (v.o.)", "You see, when I first went foraging, what I actually found was the smoldering wreckage of the ship.  Ignoring all danger, I charged inside to liberate our provisions."
6, 90, "Leela", "So this is the trail mix Fry gave me!"
6, 90, "Zapp", "Yes!  I exaggerated when I said I picked it from the treetops.  I just wanted you to think  a little better of me."
6, 90, "Leela", "Well, your motives were good.  And we were both loopy from dehydration.  Hey, wait!  You've been doing an awful lot of urinating!"
6, 90, "Zapp", "Ooooooiiiiiiigeeeaaaaaaaaaah, there's plenty of water! You see...[Flashback"
6, 90, "Zapp (v.o.)", "...after I selflessly rescued the trail mix, I braved the flames once more in search of fluids."
6, 90, "Leela", "Then why didn't you give me any?"
6, 90, "Zapp", "I though it might help you forget your intense hatred for me if you were a teensy bit delirious."
6, 90, "Leela", "So you let me dehydrate while you washed down the trail mix with imported mineral water?"
6, 90, "Zapp", "Diiiiiiiiaaaaaaaaaah, not exactly.[Flashback"
6, 90, "Zapp (v.o.)", "You see, besides the trail mix, the minibar also contained Doritos, beef jerky and a generous assortment of fine chocolates."
6, 90, "Zapp", "I wanted to offer you the chocolates, I truly did.  But I was concerned about your waistline.  Very concerned."
6, 90, "Leela", "It's because I haven't been exercising.  If only this tree hadn't fallen on me by chance.   Oh, dear God!"
6, 90, "Zapp", "Gluuuuuuuuyiiiiiiiiiiiih, it was just after we crashed!"
6, 90, "Zapp (v.o.)", "I awoke first to find you trapped."
6, 90, "Zapp", "Leela.  Leela! Wake up!"
6, 90, "Leela", "You could've moved this grub-infested log anytime you wanted?!"
6, 90, "Zapp", "Well, sure.  But then I wouldn't have been able to provide the loving care you wouldn't have needed."
6, 90, "Leela", "I'd leave you to rot in this paradise if only the ship weren't destroyed!  The ship's fully functional, isn't it?"
6, 90, "Zapp", "Ee-iiiiiiiiiiiiiiih, you see..."
6, 90, "Zapp (v.o.)", "...after re-trapping you and before feigning unconsciousness, I paused to enjoy a cigar.  Though mellow and satisfying, it did parch me a bit.  So I went in search of brandy.  That's when my keen senses detected the still invisible ship."
6, 90, "Zapp", "Ow!"
6, 90, "Leela", "So we can go back to Earth?  But there is no Earth anymore!  Everyone I know is dead!"
6, 90, "Fry", "Ah, this seems like a good place to take a dump.  Leela? You're alive!"
6, 90, "Leela", "Fry!  But how did you find this planet?  Well?"
6, 90, "Zapp", "Oooheeeeeeaaaaiiiiiiih, we're actually on Earth!  The ship's homing device brought us back!"
6, 90, "Leela", "But I saw Earth explode!"
6, 90, "Zapp", "I'm actually kinda proud of this one.  You see..."
6, 90, "Zapp (v.o.)", "What you saw was merely a simulation I rigged up using the ship's holographic targeting projector.  The alleged telescope was a toilet paper tube."
6, 90, "Leela", "You said there wasn't any toilet paper!  And that humanity was annihilated!"
6, 90, "Zapp", "My motives were pure!  I just wanted you think we had to save humanity so you'd be willing to have sex.  Please say you believe me."
6, 90, "Leela", "Yes.  I believe you."
6, 90, "Fry", "Yay!"
6, 90, "Bender", "There must be somethin' to steal on this island.  Hey, it's Leela!Leela"
6, 90, "Leela", "Let's go home, everybody.  At least the Earth wasn't destroyed.  Yet."
6, 90, "V-GINY", "People of Earth, hear the righteous word of the Mighty V-GINY!"
6, 90, "Bender", "The Mighty V-GINY!"
6, 90, "V-GINY", "Seeing you frolic in this unspoiled garden gives hope that this world may yet be redeemed."
6, 90, "Farnsworth", "Huzzah!  The purity chant worked!"
6, 90, "V-GINY", "Unacceptable wardrobe malfunction!  I was referring to Adam and Eve."
6, 90, "Leela", "We're not Adam and Eve.  You see, due to a series of—"
6, 90, "V-GINY", "Consummate your union or I shall destroy Earth!"
6, 90, "Leela", "Well, if it's to save Earth, I-I guess I could take one for the team."
6, 90, "Zapp", "You what?  R-Right now?  Eh, but I need a little romance, first.  Maybe a vanilla candle or something."
6, 90, "V-GINY", "Commence intercourse."
6, 90, "Zapp", "The giant guns are making me feel sort of...inadequate.  I'm not sure if I could—"
6, 90, "Leela", "Move it!  I gotta get home and do laundry!"
6, 90, "Fry", "For God's sake, censor it!!! CENSOR IT!!!"
6, 90, "V-GINY", "Approved for all audiences!!"
6, 90, "Fry", "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!"
6, 90, "Transition Announcer", "And now, the spicy finale of The Transcredible Exploits of Zapp Brannigan!"
6, 90, "Zapp", "That was a close call but we saved Earth.  Was it as good for you as it was for the human race?"
6, 90, "Leela Actress", "Oh, Zapp, let's save another planet right now!"
6, 91, "Poopenmeyer", "As mayor, it is my deeply tedious pleasure to kick off the 83rd or 84th Annual e-Waste Recycling Festival!"
6, 91, "Bender", "Down in front!"
6, 91, "Zoidberg", "Sorry, I get aroused in crowds."
6, 91, "Poopenmeyer", "I will now throw out the ceremonial first dump"
6, 91, "Farnsworth", "These old doomsday devices are dangerously unstable.  I'll rest easier not knowing where they are."
6, 91, "Leela", "So long, overly complicated Japanese toilet!"
6, 91, "Toilet", "Please.  I not to throw away.  I give you, uh, Happy Poopie Time."
6, 91, "Fry", "Sorry, you know too much."
6, 91, "Bender", "Seems like a good place to ditch some evidence.  Flexo?!  What are you doin' in a hazardous wastebin?"
6, 91, "Flexo", "Haven't you heard?  Us bending units are dangerously outdated.  We overheat, we're radioactive, we cause erectile dysfun—"
6, 91, "Farnsworth", "Who were you talking to?"
6, 91, "Bender", "No one? Your mama? Shut up? Take your pick."
6, 91, "Scoop Chang", "Scoop Chang, New New York Times Online Podcast blog comments editor.  Mr. Mayor, isn't this e-waste dangerous?"
6, 91, "Poopenmeyer", "Not at all, Scoop. Not after it's hauled off to the Third World by an expendable team of minimum-wage nobodies."
6, 91, "Farnsworth", "Good news, nobodies!"
6, 91, "Antarian #1", "Greetings, my friends. It shan't take long to strip down your clunker."
6, 91, "Leela", "There's nothing wrong with our clunker."
6, 91, "Antarian #1", "Really? Because we can smelt out the deadly, deadly chromium to make rat poison and artificial sweeteners."
6, 91, "Leela", "No, thanks. We're delivering e-waste."
6, 91, "Antarian #1", "Pity. We're halfway done."
6, 91, "Antarian #2", "This thing is 40% chromium."
6, 91, "Antarian #1", "Gentle now.  Gentle with the hover dumpster."
6, 91, "Antarian #1", "Ready for processing!"
6, 91, "Fry", "What smells like bloody sinuses?"
6, 91, "Antarian #1", "We burn your e-waste down to the usable metals, safely releasing the toxins into our air and drinking water."
6, 91, "Leela", "Uch!  That's the worst thing I've ever seen!"
6, 91, "Antarian #1", "Really? Then don't look over there.  Okay, kids, let's play Find the Shiny!"
6, 91, "Leela", "That's even more horrific! Is all the work done by children?"
6, 91, "Antarian #1", "No. Not the whipping.[Scene"
6, 91, "Leela", "Granted, we later learned some positive things about recycling.  But a better solution is to use our electronics as long as possible, instead of throwing them out in the first place.   I'm gonna start by keeping my old cell phone, even if it is outdated."
6, 91, "Phone", "Hello, Miss Turanga, your call to St. Louis has gone through."
6, 91, "Bender", "Well, let's at least throw this TV out.  The batteries in the remote are gettin' low."
6, 91, "Leela", "No! Put that back and turn it on!"
6, 91, "Bender", "I was just tryin' to help."
6, 91, "Morbo", "More on this breaking puff piece after a word from our sponsor."
6, 91, "Announcer", "WIth the new eyePhone, you can watch, listen, ignore your friends, stalk your ex, download porno on a crowded bus, even check your E-mail while getting hit by a train.  All with the new eyePhone."
6, 91, "Mom (v.o.)", "From Mom."
6, 91, "Leela", "A new eyePhone? Forget this junk."
6, 91, "Phone", "Well, this is a fine howdoyoudo."
6, 91, "Hermes", "So long."
6, 91, "Fry", "Sayonara."
6, 91, "Amy", "Buh-bye."
6, 91, "Zoidberg", "Good riddance."
6, 91, "Bender", "Yep."
6, 91, "Farnsworth", "Toodle-oo!"
6, 91, "Leela", "Come on!  Let's buy some eyePhones on line!"
6, 91, "Fry", "Wait.  I thought we were buying our eyePhones online."
6, 91, "Leela", "We are on line."
6, 91, "Fry", "But I thought the Mom Store was across town."
6, 91, "Amy", "It is across town.Fry"
6, 91, "Fry", "But I thought—"
6, 91, "Bender", "Stop thinking, Fry!"
6, 91, "Fry", "I feel like a mindless zombie.  I wish I knew how long we've been waiting."
6, 91, "Beeler", "The eyePhone has an app for that!"
6, 91, "Bender", "Is there an app for kissin' my shiny metal ass?"
6, 91, "Beeler", "Several!"
6, 91, "Bender", "Ooooooh!"
6, 91, "Farnsworth", "Oh, no!  The light!  I guess I'm off to Hell."
6, 91, "Hermes", "That's the store, Professor."
6, 91, "Farnsworth", "Eh-wha?"
6, 91, "Amy", "Shwow! It's that obscure underground song that's constantly playing everywhere."
6, 91, "Mom", "Hello, dearies.  Welcome to the Mom Store.  The new eyePhones are in short supply, so please form an orderly—"
6, 91, "Bender", "Outta the way!"
6, 91, "Fry", "Are there any left?"
6, 91, "Salesman", "There may be one."
6, 91, "Salesman", "Okay, it's $500, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold a charge and the reception isn't very—"
6, 91, "Fry", "Shut up and take my money!!"
6, 91, "Mom", "The new eyePhone is wonderful. I use it to check recipes and send threatening e-mails to unauthorized third party app developers."
6, 91, "Fry", "Say, you're from one of those ethnicities that knows about technology.  Why's it called an eyePhone?"
6, 91, "Salesman", "I'll explain after I install it."
6, 91, "Fry", "Neat."
6, 91, "Salesman", "Now for the earpiece."
6, 91, "Mom", "But my favorite app is called ""Twitcher"".  Twitcher lets you send and receive short messages or videos called ""twits"".  Why,  here's a twit now."
6, 91, "Larry", "Hi, Mom, I love you more than Kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar—"
6, 91, "eyePhone", "Low battery."
6, 91, "Mom", "But don't take my word for it.  Unbiasedreviews.mom says, ""Twitcher is the Killer App!"""
6, 91, "Mom", "And when I say, ""killer app"", I mean, ""KILLER app!"""
6, 91, "Announcer", "And now, another downloadisode of ""The Real Housewives of Sim City""!"
6, 91, "Sims Woman", "She needs to reset.  I'll say it to her face."
6, 91, "Fry", "No wonder traditional media is dead!  Check out this webisode of Hypnotoad."
6, 91, "Bender", "Enjoy your outdated format, Grandpa.   Nowadays, cool kids like me mash up our own phoneisodes."
6, 91, "Calculon", "It's from the kidnappers.  My nephew is alive and he's...in this envelope."
6, 91, "Calculon's Nephew", "They cut off one of my dimensions!"
6, 91, "Calculon", "No.  No!"
6, 91, "Bender", "Oh, my God! It's Bender! He'll save us!"
6, 91, "Fry", "What's happening to me?  Is it puberty?"
6, 91, "Bender", "It's a phone call, dingus."
6, 91, "Fry", "These eyePhones are phones, too?"
6, 91, "Bender", "Duh!"
6, 91, "Fry", "Fry-lo."
6, 91, "Leela", "Hi, Fry.  Did you know these eyePhones are phones, too?"
6, 91, "Fry", "Duh.  Hey, is it safe to talk while you're flying?"
6, 91, "Leela", "Oh, totally.  This thing's hands-free.   That's how I can eat this taco  and this spaghetti."
6, 91, "Leela", "I'm hanging up now."
6, 91, "Bender", "Hey, check out this Internet video of some idiot crashing her spaceship!"
6, 91, "Leela", "You recorded that?"
6, 91, "Bender", "The eyePhone records everything.  All I did was add a laugh track and twit it to my 10,000 followers."
6, 91, "Fry", "Oh, that reminds me.  It's time to twit my hourly twupdate.   'Sup, followers?  Fry here.  Burpin' eggs.  Scratchin' my underarm fungus.  Lookin' for love.  Send."
6, 91, "Larry", "Underarm fungus?  Too much informatio— OW!"
6, 91, "Mom", "It's exactly the right amount of information!  For years, I've collected personal data with old-fashioned methods like spybots and infosquitoes."
6, 91, "Infosquito", "This guy sure loves porno."
6, 91, "Mom", "But now, thanks to Twitcher, morons voluntarily spew out every fact I need to exploit them."
6, 91, "Walt", "Target acquired, Mother."
6, 91, "Mom", "Fire direct marketing algorithm!"
6, 91, "Man", "Do you suffer from the heartbreak of...?"
6, 91, "Fry's Voice", """—my underarm fungus."""
6, 91, "Man", "Then, you, Mr. or Mrs. ... , need the soothing relief of Mom's Caustic Anti-Fungal Bleach!"
6, 91, "Fry", "Ooh, can I somehow charge it to my eyePhone for an additional fee?"
6, 91, "Mom (v.o.)", "Hell, yes!"
6, 91, "Ad", "Hey, fatso, stuffa you face!"
6, 91, "Hermes", "This thing always seems to know when I get the munchies!  Attention followers"
6, 91, "Leela", "Duh. That's why we all came over here for lunch. Send."
6, 91, "Bender", "Greetings, followers"
6, 91, "Fry", "You have 50,000 followers? I only have three. Send."
6, 91, "Leela", "I unsubscribed yesterday."
6, 91, "Bender", "I got the most followers cuz I give the people what they want, like this video of you doin' karate in your underpants."
6, 91, "Fry", "Help!  Police!"
6, 91, "Bender", "Send."
6, 91, "Fry", "That is low, Bender.  Even by your standards."
6, 91, "Bender", "My what, now?"
6, 91, "Fry", "Since when is the internet about robbing people of their privacy?"
6, 91, "Bender", "August 6, 1991."
6, 91, "Fry", "I'll bet I can get as many followers as you without sinking to your level.  What do you say?  First one to a million followers wins a buck."
6, 91, "Bender", "You're on!  Send."
6, 91, "Fry", "What happens to the loser?"
6, 91, "Bender", "Let's make it interesting."
6, 91, "Amy", "Splech!  Why is Mr. Chunks doing that?"
6, 91, "Bender", "Because the loser of our bet has to do a double somersault into a tub of alien goat vomit."
6, 91, "Fry", "Wait!  Let's make it interestinger!  Vomit and diarrhea!"
6, 91, "Bender", "Good idea!  That way, we don't waste an end!"
6, 91, "Leela", "Eg, it's putrid! What do you feed him?"
6, 91, "Bender", "What comes out one end we feed to the other.  Also Indian food.  Let the contest begin![Montage"
6, 91, "Mom", "Amazing.  Some dumb bastard has nearly a million other dumb bastards following his every twit.   Are you dumb bastards listening to me, you dumb bastards?"
6, 91, "Igner", "Why are you so angry, Mommy?"
6, 91, "Mom", "Oh, I'm sorry.  I guess I'm just a little nervous about my evil plan.  YOU DUMB BASTARDS!!!   You see, the plan is about to enter phase two.  As soon as someone reaches a million followers, I'll use them to transmit...the Twitworm!"
6, 91, "Walt", "Oh, Mother, you devious hag, tell us more about this ""Twitworm""."
6, 91, "Mom", "It's a very special computer virus, for instead of infecting computers, it infects...the human brain!"
6, 91, "Infosquito", "I like it!"
6, 91, "Mom", "The million followers will become an army of zombies eager to obey my every command!"
6, 91, "Larry", "The important thing is we're a family."
6, 91, "Mom", "NO IT'S NOT!"
6, 91, "Amy", "Ew!  He sneezed in it!"
6, 91, "Fry", "Oh, God, I'm gonna lose the bet!  I'm gonna have to swim in the juice of the puke-me-poop-yu!"
6, 91, "Amy", "Don't give up.  You just need more titillating twits."
6, 91, "Fry", "Trust me, I want twits that tittle."
6, 91, "Leela", "Then you're gonna have to sink to Bender's level. Stop acting like the Queen of England."
6, 91, "Female Voice", "La la la la la la la!"
6, 91, "Fry", "Whose that?  The Queen of England?"
6, 91, "Leela", "Uh, e-e-excuse me.  I have to...someplace."
6, 91, "Fry", "That was odd.  Where'd that singing come from?"
6, 91, "Amy", "It wasn't the goat.  All of its orifices are in use."
6, 91, "Female Voice", "I dreamed a dream in time gone by..."
6, 91, "Leela and Female Voice", "When hope was high and life worth living.I dreamed that love would never die."
6, 91, "Susan", "I dreamed that God would be forgiving."
6, 91, "Fry", "What the hell is that?"
6, 91, "Leela", "Nothing."
6, 91, "Susan", "I'm not nothing!  All my life, everyone's called me, ""nothing""!"
6, 91, "Fry", "You have a boil on your butt that sings showtunes with you?"
6, 91, "Leela", "Don't look at me!  I'm a freak!"
6, 91, "Fry", "No, no.   Well..."
6, 91, "Leela", "I've been ashamed of Susan as long as I can remember."
6, 91, "Fry", "You named your boil Susan?"
6, 91, "Susan", "A boil cannae have a name. He also said a boil cannae sing.  But...  Amazing grace, how—"
6, 91, "Fry", "Ew, she's Scottish!"
6, 91, "Leela", "I lance her every few months, but she always grows back.  It's hard enough being a cyclops, but if anyone found out about Susan, I'd be devastated."
6, 91, "Susan", "Amazing grace, how—"
6, 91, "Fry", "Woah, gross.  Million follower gross."
6, 91, "Leela", "Fry, delete that! Delete that right now!"
6, 91, "Fry", "What?  Oh.  Okay."
6, 91, "Bender", "So much for a pleasant swim in vomit."
6, 91, "Fry", "Send"
6, 91, "Leela", "Did you delete it?"
6, 91, "Fry", "Eh."
6, 91, "Leela", "Thanks, Fry.  You're a good friend."
6, 91, "Fry", "Ih."
6, 91, "Susan", "Amazing grace, how— [Scene"
6, 91, "Hoschel", "Hey, there she goes in the jen-you-ine!  Let's get ta hootin'!  HOOOOOOOOOO!"
6, 91, "Sal", "Whoa-whoa-whoas!  If it ain'ts the world's number ones internet sensation!"
6, 91, "Leela", "Where?  Also, what?"
6, 91, "Susan (v.o.)", "Ama-"
6, 91, "Susan (v.o.)", "-zing grace, how"
6, 91, "Hermes", "Play it one more time!"
6, 91, "Farnsworth", "No! It's humiliating and degrading to Leela!  Play it ten more times!"
6, 91, "Fry", "I know I shouldn't have twitted that but  not swimming in barf might ease my conscience."
6, 91, "Zoidberg", "But if Leela should find out, her dignity sac will rupture."
6, 91, "Fry", "That's why we can't let her see this.  Leela, lock the doors so Leela doesn't—EEEEE!"
6, 91, "Leela", "How could you do this?!!"
6, 91, "Amy", "Poor Mr. Chunks.  At least he died doing what he loved."
6, 91, "Bender", "He's in a better place now.Scruffy"
6, 91, "Scruffy", "There.  I turned a regular board into a divin' board.   Mm-hmm."
6, 91, "Farnsworth", "Impending news, everyone!  We're about to learn the winner of the bet!"
6, 91, "Bender", "Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!  I hope it's me![Scene"
6, 91, "Bender", "Wait a minute!  There's a chance I could lose?  That wasn't part of the deal!"
6, 91, "Hermes", "Sweet Georgia Brown of Kingston Town! It's a tie!  Since no one lost, no one has to jump!"
6, 91, "Bender", "Alright, a tie! I win again!!"
6, 91, "Fry", "Oh, I'm a scuzzball."
6, 91, "Zoidberg", "Don't feel bad.  At least you're not Leela."
6, 91, "Mom", "A tie?  This worked out better than I could have hoped!  Now I'll have two million zombies!"
6, 91, "Walt", "Actually, Fry and Bender may share some of the same followers.  All we can say for sure is that there will be between one million and two million zombies."
6, 91, "Mom", "All I can say for sure is...  Now stop getting slapped and power up the Twitworm!"
6, 91, "Hoschel", "It's both disgusting and inspiring, like Jared from Subway."
6, 91, "Leela", "Okay, I'm a freak with a singing butt boil, but I'm still a human being more or less."
6, 91, "Sal", "Singin' butts boil?  That's yesterday'ses news."
6, 91, "Hoschel", "Like that giant caterpillar what ate Jared from Subway."
6, 91, "Sal", "Nows us internet geeks gots a whole new video sensation."
6, 91, "Leela", "So my humiliation is over?"
6, 91, "Sal", "Who are you?"
6, 91, "Mom", "And now, to create an unstoppable army of between one and two million zombies!"
6, 91, "Igner", "Uh, shouldn't you wait for the weather to clear up?"
6, 91, "Mom", "No!  I give you...the Twitworm!  Send."
6, 91, "Fry", "Aaah!  I'm sick of my head doing things!  Leela!"
6, 91, "Leela", "Fry, I came to talk to you."
6, 91, "Fry", "No, I came to talk to you."
6, 91, "Leela", "It looked like you were just sitting there, but whatever."
6, 91, "Fry", "I am so, so sorry for what I did.  And I know I can never make it up to you."
6, 91, "Leela", "You don't have to apologize.  In fact, I came to thank you."
6, 91, "Fry", "I think you mean hit me."
6, 91, "Leela", "Everyone knows my secret, but no one cares.  I have nothing to hide anymore.  Oh, Fry, thanks to your selfish rudeness, a terrible weight has been lifted from my heart!"
6, 91, "Susan (v.o.)", "That's not the only place you need a terrible weight lifted!"
6, 91, "Leela", "Susan and I are agreed.  For the first time in our lives, we're not ashamed of who we are."
6, 91, "Susan (v.o.)", "I was never ashamed."
6, 91, "Leela", "Come here.   What stinks?  Were you rolling around in New Jersey?"
6, 91, "Fry", "Leela, I knew I could never make it up to you, so I did the next best thing.  I put myself through the same humiliation I put you through."
6, 91, "Leela", "Aw, you didn't have to do that."
6, 91, "Fry", "I didn't? Damn."
6, 91, "Leela", "Don't worry.  By tomorrow, no one will remember."
6, 91, "Fry", "Can I have another hug?"
6, 91, "Leela", "No."
6, 91, "Susan (v.o.)", "Oh, hold yer nose an' give it a go!"
6, 91, "Mom (v.o.)", "Introducing the all new eyePhone 2.0!"
6, 91, "Mom", "Dumb bastards."
6, 92, "Linda", "We now go live to our eye-in-the-sky hovercopter on the scene of that terrible hovercopter crash. Jim?"
6, 92, "Jim", "The scene is not good, Linda. I've just learned that my last words were"
6, 92, "Linda", "One for the blooper reel."
6, 92, "Kif", "The news is so violent. Let's watch Rachael Ray instead. No, wait. There might be chopping."
6, 92, "Amy", "God, what a wuss. Stop being such a spineless jellyfish."
6, 92, "Kif", "You know full well that I am more closely related to the sea cucumber."
6, 92, "Amy", "Not where it counts."
6, 92, "Morbo", "I hated Jim! In other news, our city's urine-soaked walls have been desicrated by a mysterious tile-work graffiti artist."
6, 92, "Linda", "Police have no idea who is behind this innovative scourge of public art."
6, 92, "Bender", "That is one sexy bridge abutment."
6, 92, "Hyper-Chicken", "Free corn? That'll suit me just fine."
6, 92, "Bender", "The key is knowing precisely where to strike.  Oops!"
6, 92, "URL", "Well, well. Time to beat him his rights."
6, 92, "Smitty", "You know, that don't look half bad on your buttocks."
6, 92, "URL", "It does sorta class-up the place."
6, 92, "Clock", "The time is 4 am."
6, 92, "Amy", "We've been arguing all night, Kif. Can't we go to bed?"
6, 92, "Kif", "Is that all you ever think about? I'm not just some piece of tofu, Amy. I need to know where we stand in our relationship."
6, 92, "Amy", "We're just going through a rough patch."
6, 92, "Kif", "It is not a patch. It's been ages, according to your wildly inappropriate ""Hunk of the Month"" calender."
6, 92, "Amy", "Leave Todd out of this!"
6, 92, "Todd", "Thanks, babe. Also, today is Canadian Independence Day."
6, 92, "Amy", "Oh, that's Bender's ringtone. I recognize the smell. Hello?"
6, 92, "Bender", "Yo, Amy, I'm in the slammer."
6, 92, "Amy", "Oh, no!"
6, 92, "Bender", "That's enough lip from you, moneybags. Just get 5 grand an bail me out."
6, 92, "Amy", "I don't have that kind of money laying around."
6, 92, "Bender", "Yeah, you do. You know that floor safe where you keep 10 grand? There's 5 grand in there. Don't make me wait!"
6, 92, "Roberto", "Hey, Bender. Ever kill a man with a sock? It ain't so hard. Ha-HAA."
6, 92, "Bender", "I better carve a shiv for protection."
6, 92, "URL", "Rodríguez! These two brothers bailed your ass out."
6, 92, "Bender", "Oh! Thank God.  Tell me, have things changed on the outside. Is food finally in pill form? What about pills? Are they in food form?"
6, 92, "Larry the Murder Burglar", "Hey, hot stuff. I'm Larry the Murder Burglar."
6, 92, "Amy", "Hi, Larry. I like your tattoos."
6, 92, "Kif", "Amy, that man's a criminal!"
6, 92, "Amy", "I was just checking out his tats.  Sneato! I have one of my mom. Wanna see?"
6, 92, "Larry the Murder Burglar", "Sure."
6, 92, "Kif", "I just don't understand why you have to flirt with every bad boy in sight."
6, 92, "Amy", "Quit exaggerating."
6, 92, "Criminal", "Nobody move, or sweet cheeks here gets it!"
6, 92, "Amy", "Oh! You're bad!"
6, 92, "URL", "Momma said, Spock you out!"
6, 92, "Kif", "That's it, Amy. Pardon my language, but I have had it with you ruffling my petticoats. You and I are through."
6, 92, "Bender", "Aw! Here's a little song I wrote to cheer you up. It's called,  Let's go already!"
6, 92, "Leela", "Here's to Amy, single, lonely, and fabulous."
6, 92, "Amy", "Thanks everybody. Looks like I'm back in the game."
6, 92, "Bender", "Yeah, the game of Old Maid."
6, 92, "Security woman", "Excuse me, sir, are those yours?"
6, 92, "Bender", "You're damn right. And, before you ask, this is mine too."
6, 92, "Fry", "Tough break, Amy. Are you and Kif getting divorced?"
6, 92, "Amy", "No. Technically we were Fonfon rus, so we weren't really married."
6, 92, "Bender", "Wow! The interesting thing about that is"
6, 92, "Leela", "So, Amy, how can I phrase this delicately? Why did Kif dump you like a sack of yesterday's turds?"
6, 92, "Amy", "He says I have a thing for bad boys. It's so stupid."
6, 92, "Bender", "The truth is often stupid."
6, 92, "Amy", "Bender, why do you have to be so mean to me?"
6, 92, "Bender", "Shut up, baby, you love it."
6, 92, "Amy", "Don't tell me to shut up! You know what happened to the last guy that told me to shut up?"
6, 92, "Bender", "What?"
6, 92, "Amy", "That was great."
6, 92, "Bender", "Shut up.  Come over here."
6, 92, "Amy", "Remember, love between a human and a robot is taboo.  We can't tell anyone, not even our co-workers."
6, 92, "Bender", "Got it. I'll show the utmost discretion as we get nasty in this glass tube."
6, 92, "Hermes", "I think I'm coming down with circusitis. [He sneezes and his face gets traditional clown fare"
6, 92, "Leela", "I thought circusitis only affected children."
6, 92, "Hermes", "Children of all ages."
6, 92, "Zoidberg", "Bender, old friend. What's on your face?"
6, 92, "Bender", "Uh. Blood. You know, from shaving of the face-beard."
6, 92, "Fry", "Amy, are those gear imprints on your sweatpants?"
6, 92, "Amy", "Uh, maybe. So what?"
6, 92, "Fry", "I only brought it up because Bender is wearing them."
6, 92, "Bender", "Uh, I stole them from her. Yeah, that's it, call the cops."
6, 92, "Hermes", "Oh, my swollen feet. He takes his feet out of the tub of water. They have turned into clown shoes] I better take my pills."
6, 92, "Bender", "Amy, I reckon sweet talk don't come natural to me, but of everyone I've ever dated, you are probably in the top ten."
6, 92, "Amy", "Aw, you always say just the wrong thing in just the right way."
6, 92, "Preacherbot", "Sinners! Robosexuality is an abomination!"
6, 92, "Bender", "Oy, this guy."
6, 92, "Preacherbot", "The good book sayeth a robot shall not lie down with a human, nor do it standing up, nor any angle in between."
6, 92, "Bender", "Look! A single mother! Let's get her!"
6, 92, "Farnsworth", "Quickly, into the ship's basement!  Now, then, as you all know, the county fair is approaching once again, so I'm preparing my entry of pickled winds and weathers.  I've got sunny, snow flurry, hail with onions, even my grandmother's cranberry-raisin typhoon, but no tornado. I'll be damned if I let Mrs. Girdleson take the blue ribbon again.  That's why I need you folks to get out there and harvest a nice ripe one. This cattle prod should help."
6, 92, "Leela", "How is that?"
6, 92, "Farnsworth", "Get out there!"
6, 92, "Leela", "Is everybody in position?"
6, 92, "Amy", "What?"
6, 92, "Zoidberg", "Is someone talking?"
6, 92, "Leela", "Okay, good. On three. One."
6, 92, "Hermes", "What did she say?"
6, 92, "Leela", "Two."
6, 92, "Bender", "Wait, I'm not in position."
6, 92, "Leela", "Three."
6, 92, "Zoidberg", "I'm ready for the countdown."
6, 92, "Leela", "I'm not hearing anyone! Abort mission!"
6, 92, "Fry", "She said, ""Go!"""
6, 92, "Farnsworth", "Good work, everyone."
6, 92, "Leela", "Honestly, that went better than I expected."
6, 92, "Farnsworth", "I just need to reduce it down into this pickle jar, toss in a bay leaf to impress those stupid judges."
6, 92, "Fry", "Hey, where's Amy and Bender?"
6, 92, "Zoidberg", "They're missing out on some hot pickle action."
6, 92, "Hermes", "Sounds like a muskrat's caught in there."
6, 92, "Leela", "That's Amy's sweatshirt!"
6, 92, "Fry", "And that's Bender's hat from the Player's ball!"
6, 92, "Hermes", "Sweet tornadoes of Barbados! Bender and Amy have been torn to shreds!"
6, 92, "Farnsworth", "Oh, the humanity! Also Bender!"
6, 92, "Amy", "Uh-oh!"
6, 92, "Farnsworth", "What's going on here?"
6, 92, "Bender", "Uh.  Nothing."
6, 92, "Farnsworth", "A pair of deviant robosexuals. Not under my roof!"
6, 92, "Bender", "What about on the roof?"
6, 92, "Farnsworth", "Get your mind out of the gutter!"
6, 92, "Bender", "What about in the gutter?"
6, 92, "Leela", "Professor, there is nothing wrong with robosexuality."
6, 92, "Hermes", "Yeah, when the lights go out, it's nobody's business what happens between two consenting adults."
6, 92, "Zoidberg", "Or one!"
6, 92, "Amy", "Thanks, guys. Everything will be okay just as long as my parents don't find out."
6, 92, "Farnsworth", "Zai jian."
6, 92, "Amy", "Mom? Dad?"
6, 92, "Leo", "Come home, Amy. It your decision. We can't make you.  Atta girl!"
6, 92, "Bender", "Uh-oh! not the innocent whistling!"
6, 92, "Preacherbot", "Repent!"
6, 92, "Bender", "Oy, this guy."
6, 92, "Inez", "Look, we're your family. And if you can't talk about your problems with us, that would be great."
6, 92, "Amy", "I don't have a problem! I'm in a happy relationship that just happens to be robosex-"
6, 92, "Leo", "You finish that word, you kill your parents."
6, 92, "Wine Bucket", "Low wine level detected."
6, 92, "Amy", "Thank you."
6, 92, "Leo", "Stop seducing him, you hussy!"
6, 92, "Amy", "Dad, gleesh! I'm attracted to Bender, not his emotionless wine bucket!"
6, 92, "Wine Bucket", "Hopes deleted."
6, 92, "Preacherbot", "Robotic brothers, the path to Robot Hell is paved with human flesh."
6, 92, "Bender", "Neat!"
6, 92, "Preacherbot", "Over the course of this escape-proof workshop, your software will be reprogrammed through prayer. And by some tech support guys in India."
6, 92, "Robosexual Robot", "But I read in Esqwired that some robots are hardwired to be robosexual."
6, 92, "Preacherbot", "Don't believe those lies, son! The one ones worth believing are the ones in the Bible. Can I get an ""Amen""?"
6, 92, "Hermaphrobot", "I'll take a-three-men, holla!"
6, 92, "Inez", "Come on, Amy! Pick a male human already!  I want to be a grandmother nine months from five minutes from now."
6, 92, "Amy", "Cut it out, Mom! I'm not interested in any of these gross, ugly losers."
6, 92, "Fry", "What about this gross, ugly, smelly loser?"
6, 92, "Leo", "Fry! What you doing here?"
6, 92, "Fry", "I'm here to rescue Amy, uh... from her robosexual desires."
6, 92, "Amy", "If I understand you correctly, I've seen the error of my ways?"
6, 92, "Leo", "Look at all that awkward winking."
6, 92, "Inez", "It must be love."
6, 92, "Amy", "My parents may be evil, but at least they're stupid."
6, 92, "Preacherbot", "In this phase, you will literally wrestle with your demons. Your shapely, buxom, human demons."
6, 92, "Fatbot", "Look at the rack on that one! Oh! I mean, that one on the rack!"
6, 92, "Preacherbot", "Good! That's real good!  Okay, everybody switch demons. No point sticking with just one demon.  Now, work it hard! Harder! Till the sin explodes! Ouch! Mmmm. Mercy. Okay, Lord's work is done. Now, now, cuddle. Cuddle with your demons."
6, 92, "Bender", "Oh, Amy. I wonder where you are right now!"
6, 92, "Amy", "I'm inside the dummy to rescue you."
6, 92, "Bender", "That answers that. Wait... Amy?"
6, 92, "Leela", "Bender, be careful!"
6, 92, "Bender", "Fry? Leela? You're in there, too? Blech."
6, 92, "Zoidberg", "I guess we should have waited in the ship."
6, 92, "Bender", "Listen up, everybody, I love Amy and I'm tired of pussyfootcupping around! I finally found someone I want to spend the rest of her life with. Amy,  will you marry me?"
6, 92, "Amy", "Yes! Yes!"
6, 92, "Farnsworth", "Oh, I'm just glad I didn't live to see this day! Wait a second,  No!"
6, 92, "Zoidberg", "Such a stone. Is it real?  Horray!"
6, 92, "Farnsworth", "Horray denied! Need I remind you that robosexual marriage is illegal!"
6, 92, "Leela", "Not in Space Massachusetts."
6, 92, "Bender", "You mean Space-tax-achusetts. No chance, stretch pants! We're gonna fight to legalize it right here!"
6, 92, "Hermes", "Yeah, man! You got to legalize it!"
6, 92, "Amy", "We're talking about robosexual marriage."
6, 92, "Hermes", "We're talking about lots of stuff."
6, 92, "Fry", "Cool! Can you turn into a race car?"
6, 92, "Hot Dog Stand", "Nah, I'm just a pre-op transformer."
6, 92, "Amy", "Thank you for coming, everyone. We're all having some good, clean fun here."
6, 92, "Hedonism Bot", "Squeaky, squishy clean!"
6, 92, "Amy", "But it's time to discuss a pressing issue, the right to marry who, or what, we want!"
6, 92, "Bender", "Every other couple has the right to marry, robot and fembot,"
6, 92, "Randy", "Our poodle has two daddies."
6, 92, "Bender", "Interracial, , Interplanetary, , even ghost and horse,  but not robot and human."
6, 92, "Amy", "That's why we're introducing this ballot initiative to legalize robosexual marriage."
6, 92, "Bender", "If you hate intolerance and begin punched in the face by me, please support Proposition Infinity!"
6, 92, "Bender", "Damn it![Scene"
6, 92, "Linda", "As election day nears, prop infinity seems doomed to certain defeat."
6, 92, "Morbo", "Doooooooomed!"
6, 92, "Linda", "More fair and balanced coverage after a word from our sponsor, No on Infinity."
6, 92, "Actor 1", "A storm is gathering."
6, 92, "Actor 2", "A storm of robosexual marriage that will rain down on us like fire."
6, 92, "Actor 1", "It's probably a firestorm."
6, 92, "Actress", "If robosexual marriage becomes legal, imagine the horrible things that will happen to our children, then imagine we said those things, since we couldn't think of any. As a mother, those things worry me."
6, 92, "Man", "Vote No on Infinity. Paid for by the Farnsworth Foundation."
6, 92, "Amy", "We can't compete against that much stock footage of clouds! We're boned!"
6, 92, "Bender", "But we still have one hope, my big televised debate! I'm our A in the hole!"
6, 92, "Fry", "Professor, who's debating for your side?"
6, 92, "Farnsworth", "Oh, that guy, you know, I forget his name."
6, 92, "Farnsworth", "That's him!"
6, 92, "George Takei's head", "Good evening, I'm George Takei's head and neck, your host for tonight's debate. You may applaud.  We flipped a coin before the debate and Bender stole it, so we'll start with him."
6, 92, "Bender", "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I... Oops. Sorry, force of habit. I support this proposition because I love a goopy, flesh-and-blood woman, and not surprisingly, she loves me. This is a simple matter of justice, which I'm not normally for. So, please, vote yes. After all, our love isn't any different than yours, except it's hotter, 'cause I'm involved."
6, 92, "Takei", "I haven't heard such an eloquent speech since Bill Shatner explained why he couldn't pay me back. Rebuttal, Professor?"
6, 92, "Farnsworth", "This $4 coffee pot talks about love, but what he describes is perversion."
6, 92, "Bender", "You wouldn't know perversion if it put clamps on your testicles! You're just jealous, 'cause you've never known true love."
6, 92, "Farnsworth", "Oh, no? Back when I was full of piss and vinegar, and my bed wasn't, I fell in love with the sweetest girl to ever skip through a field of posies.  Her name was Eunice, and we spent our blissful days working in a lab, developing a poison to wipe out that dreadful posy infestation.  I thought our love would last forever. But then, 43 years later, she left me  for a robot!  How could she do that to me, her Farnypoo?"
6, 92, "Amy", "That's it? You hate robosexual 'cause your girlfriend left you for a robot?"
6, 92, "Farnsworth", "She didn't just leave me for a robot. She was a robot!  Oh, God! Her name wasn't Eunice, it was Unit! Unit 47.  My heart was broken, and like a bitter, old picklepuss, I took my anger out on robosexuals everywhere. I'm so ashamed! At the risk of losing this debate, I beg you, support Proposition Infinity."
6, 92, "Bender", "Give me a hug."
6, 92, "George Takei's head", "I, too, am hugging them in spirit. And now, they're hugging me back. Oh, my!"
6, 92, "Linda", "In a stunning turnout, voters have approved Proposition Infinity. Robosexual marriage is now legal."
6, 92, "Morbo", "What's next, gay robosexual marriage?"
6, 92, "Amy", "We did it, honey! Finally, we can have a legal, monogamous marriage, like everyone else!"
6, 92, "Bender", "Woo-hoo! Yeah! ... Monogamous?"
6, 92, "Radio announcer", "And now, a long-distance dedication from a squishy, green bad boy to his pink pork dumpling.  At number 12, it's Wailing Fungus with ""Shut Up and Love Me""."
6, 92, "Wailing Fungus", "I told you where.I told you when.I told you how.And we'll meet up at ten.But you keep on talkin'.You keep on yackin'.Chorus"
6, 93, "Morbo", "Silence, puny audience. And welcome to Who Dares to be a Millionaire? Tremble before Morbo's mighty likability,  as I chitchat with out first contestant, Philip J. Fry."
6, 93, "Bender", "Give him hell, Morbo!"
6, 93, "Morbo", "Prepare for pleasantries.  So Fry, what do you do for a living?"
6, 93, "Fry", "Me? Um, can I phone a friend?"
6, 93, "Morbo", "Chitchat achieved!  Are you ready to play?"
6, 93, "Fry", "I didn't come to play. I came to win. Now let's play."
6, 93, "Morbo", "For $1, what tool is used to hammer a nail? Is it, A, a hammer? B, A nail? C..."
6, 93, "Fry", "B, nail, final answer!"
6, 93, "Hermes", "Sweet dodo of Lesotho! Don't you ever stop to think before you speak?"
6, 93, "Fry", "I never stop to think about it."
6, 93, "Leela", "Aw, leave Fry alone. His intelligence is just a little differenty."
6, 93, "Bender", "You big dummy!"
6, 93, "Fry", "Hey, I'm begining to think you guys don't think I'm very smart."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "You can barely remember your own name, Einstein."
6, 93, "Fry", "Einstein is a hard name to remember. . Ow!"
6, 93, "Amy", "Smeesh, Professor. Don't have a schmaneurysm. Fry's your distant relative."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "Not distant enough! I'll be a monkey's uncle if I'm this monkey's nephew!"
6, 93, "Fry", "But you're my only family. Who will hug me if I achieve something?"
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "Oh, perhaps I've been too harsh. Come, lad, take my hand and I'll explain why I find you so repugnant."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "All my life I've been inspired by great minds. Euclid, Copernicus, Braino. And my personal role model, Leonardo da Vinci."
6, 93, "Fry", "What turned them to stone?"
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "da Vinci was history's greatest artist and inventor.  Voilà! He invented flying machines, war engines, submarines."
6, 93, "Fry", "Uh-oh! Nibbler died in the wall."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "That's not Nibbler. That's my most precious possession. Leonardo's beard! I paid a fortune for it at an auction of historic body parts. I suppose if I have an Achilles' heel, it's because I bought it at that same auction."
6, 93, "Fry", "Indeed so. Most indeededly."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "Careful with that, you fool!  No! No! But possibly yes."
6, 93, "Fry", "What is it, Professor?"
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "Oh, my! It's da Vinci's fabled lost invention. Even the scholars who wrote of this device had no idea what it was for. And now, at least, neither do I!"
6, 93, "Fry", "Maybe we can figure it out."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "We?"
6, 93, "Fry", "Well, I may not have brain smarts, but at least I have street smarts."
6, 93, "Fry", "I was in the hospital two weeks. No one visited me."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "Quiet, you! I'm trying to deduce the function of da Vinci's lost invention."
6, 93, "Fry", "Not even a card."
6, 93, "Farnsowrth", "He might have hidden a clue in one of his other works. Ergo, I sent Bender out for a copy of the Last Supper."
6, 93, "Bender", "I'm back! Everyone at Kinko's was an idiot, so I just brought the original."
6, 93, "Zoidberg", "Jesus Christ! ...and his Twelve Apostles!"
6, 93, "Amy", "That's odd. This hand here doesn't belong to anybody. And it's pointing a knife at James the Lesser!"
6, 93, "Bender", "That's the great thing about that hand."
6, 93, "Hermes", "And what about these funky table legs? It's like their part of some other, funkier painting."
6, 93, "Zoidberg", "Maybe da Vinci painted over something else. It's called a pentimento."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "That's true, Dr. Zoidberg. How did you know that?"
6, 93, "Zoidberg", "My doctorate is in Art History."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "Let's see what's under the Last Supper."
6, 93, "Hermes", "Wait a second, I'm not big-boned, I'm just fat."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "My God! Look!"
6, 93, "Amy", "My God! I'm looking!"
6, 93, "Leela", "My God! Saint James was a robot!"
6, 93, "Zoidberg", "My God! da Vinci left his legs unpainted as a clue."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "My God! This is the greatest mystery of all time. We must fly to Rome and exhume the body of Saint James."
6, 93, "Hermes", "Didn't we used to be a delivery company?"
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "To the ship!"
6, 93, "Fry", "Psst. Leela, wanna join the Mile-Deep Club?"
6, 93, "Leela", "Sure, why not?"
6, 93, "Farnswoth", "No time! I've found a clue that could unlock all the secrets of history.  Look at these Roman numerals."
6, 93, "Fry", "Roman numerals? I've got it! We're in Rome."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "Don't be stupid. It's a long lost mathematical code. I'll need to consult these ancient writings.  Some preposterous hog-wash about the Fibonacci Sequence. Aha! The markings indicate how many paces we need to take. One ... Okay, we're there."
6, 93, "Bender", "Brothers and sisters, let us pry."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "It's true, Saint James really was a robot."
6, 93, "Bender", "I bet he's up in Robot Heaven right now. So he won't miss his eyes."
6, 93, "Fry", "My God! Robot Saint James is a zombie."
6, 93, "Animatronio", "Nay, I am not Saint James."
6, 93, "Bender", "Enough of your lies, Saint James. We saw you in the Last Supper."
6, 93, "Animatronio", "The great man Leonardo built me as an artist's model. When I took repose in this coffin, I carefully tossed the real Saint  James in yonder heap.  I'm sure you have many questions. Come, there is a chamber where I used to speak with Pope John the Patient."
6, 93, "Animatronio", "I told him I'd be back in five minutes. Ah well, he'll make a nice heap.  I am Animatronio, guardian of da Vinci's great secret. He left my legs visible in the painting as a clue, then dispatched me hither to wait for his shadow society of intellectuals."
6, 93, "Fry", "Hi, Animatronio."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "You personally knew da Vinci?  Was he nice? How did his hair smell? And on a personal note, what is the function of this device?"
6, 93, "Animatronio", "Halt! You do not know the function of the Macchina Magnifica? Then thou art not members of the Shadow Society."
6, 93, "Bender", "The what now?"
6, 93, "Animatronio", "Not one more word shall I breathe. Not even about the great fountain where thou mayest find the... Wait. Thou didst not know about the fountain, didst thou? Curses, I must be punished."
6, 93, "Farnswoth", "Quick, we must find out what he knows before he flays himself to death!"
6, 93, "Leela", "Where is the great fountain?"
6, 93, "Fry", "What makes it so great?"
6, 93, "Bender", "Why does a robot need a codpiece?"
6, 93, "Animatronio", "Fie, thou fen-suckled bum-bailey! Thou wilst never pry information from these mechanical lips!"
6, 93, "Leela", "Just tell us, already!"
6, 93, "Animatronio", "Okay, the fountain thou seekest is..."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "And so dies our hope of solving this mystery. Come on gang, let's go home. Wait! Let's not give up so easily. Animatronio mentioned a fountain.  That's a statue of Neptune, god of water. The number of points on him trident is three, or trey. The ""u"" in his name is written like ""v"". Trey, ""v"". Trevi! It's the Trevi Fountain. There can be no question!"
6, 93, "Leela", "But, Professor..."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "There can be no question!"
6, 93, "Fry", "Wow, it hasn't changed in a thousand years."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "Okay, everyone, into the fountain."
6, 93, "Bender", "What are you, senile? I'm not jumping in there."
6, 93, "Fry", "Hey, look. Coins."
6, 93, "Bender", "I got 48 cents. There's one more nickel, and it's a big one!"
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "Quickly, into the sewer hole."
6, 93, "Leela", "Why?"
6, 93, "Fry", "What's this dump?"
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "My god! It's the Pantheon!"
6, 93, "Leela", "This place is 3,000 years old. What could possibly be left to discover?"
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "Maybe something about ourselves, Leela. Wait! What's under that blanket?  My God! da Vinci's Vitruvian Man!"
6, 93, "Fry", "It's truly a masterpiece. Note how the perspective lines draw the eye right to his dong."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "Say, what's this?"
6, 93, "Bender", "Anyone hear something?"
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "It's a coin slot. Bender, insert that giant nickel."
6, 93, "Bender", "Sure.  Ow!"
6, 93, "Farnswoth", "Hush, Bender.  What's your game, Vitruvian Man?  I withdraw the question, Vitruvian Man."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "Da Vinci's lost workshop!"
6, 93, "Fry", "At the risk of sounding stupid, do these things actually work?"
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "Of course not, stupid!  I mean, that flying machine is as aerodynamic as a sofa. How could it possibly get off the ground?"
6, 93, "Animatronio", "In a way that shalt never discover. ."
6, 93, "Fry", "Hi, Animatronio."
6, 93, "Animatronio", "I feign death and stalk thee, that I might preserve the greatest of Leonardo's secrets!"
6, 93, "Bender", "All right, buddy, we want secrets! And they better be ancient!"
6, 93, "Animatronio", "Porco metallico! Never shall I reveal how these wonderous machines fit together!"
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "They fit together?"
6, 93, "Animatronio", "I said no such thing. And then I died!"
6, 93, "Fry", "You're right, Professor. This thing doesn't fly."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "Don't sit in there, you idiot! That's dangerous!  Wha?  No wonder this contraction isn't aerodynamic! It's not an aircraft, it's a spacecraft!"
6, 93, "Animatronio", "Basta! As I live, thou shan't discover the great secret!"
6, 93, "Fry", "Bye, Animatronio!"
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "My God! Why would Leonardo's machine's brought us here?"
6, 93, "Fry", "I don't know. Let's ask this guy."
6, 93, "Leonardo da Vinci", "I am Leonardo.  Welcome to Planet Vinci."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "My God!"
6, 93, "Fry", "That's what I was gonna say!"
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "Leonardo! You're alive? Here?"
6, 93, "Leonardo", "You have learned my great secret. I was but a visitor to Earth. In truth, I am what you call a space alien."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "Oh!"
6, 93, "Fry", "It's an honor to meet you, Leonardo. And may I say you were great in Titanic. The Beach? Neh."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "That's Leonardo DiCaprio, you blockhead!"
6, 93, "Fry", "Looks like eating rocks wasn't as dumb as you said."
6, 93, "Fry", "So what do people do for fun here?"
6, 93, "Leonardo", "Do you enjoy partying all night with plenty of ale and lusty women?"
6, 93, "Fry", "I sure do!"
6, 93, "Leonardo", "Not us. We spend our leisure time in the mathematics museum. Planet Vinci is basically a single colossal university."
6, 93, "Fry", "How your football team?"
6, 93, "Leonardo", "Learned."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "Ooh! I'm going to check out that math lecture.  All this knowledge is giving me a raging brainer!"
6, 93, "Leonardo", "Would you like to hear the lecture, too, Fry?"
6, 93, "Fry", "No. It would just go in one ear and out some other hole."
6, 93, "Leonardo", "Come, sit down."
6, 93, "Fry", "Now that I can do.  I have a terrible secret to confess, Mr. DiCaprio. I'm not very smart."
6, 93, "Leonardo", "I appreciate your candor."
6, 93, "Fry", "I don't even know what language you're speaking."
6, 93, "Leonardo", "I, too, have a confession. You see, here on Planet Vinci, I am the stupidest person."
6, 93, "Fry", "What? Who possibly think you're stupid?"
6, 93, "Biff", "Duh, I'm Leonardo. I don't know the mass of the Higgs boson."
6, 93, "Woman", "Duh, I have to draw in pencil, because I don't know how to use Rendering software."
6, 93, "Leonardo", "Stupid Biff. Thinks he's so smart."
6, 93, "Fry", "He looks stronger than you, too."
6, 93, "Leonardo", "I went to Earth because I could no longer stand the ridicule. But being surrounded by even stupider people was equally infuriating."
6, 93, "Fry", "I can see myself in your shiny button."
6, 93, "Leonardo", "Inventing is what makes me happy. Or did, until I misplaced the plans for my masterpiece."
6, 93, "Fry", "You mean these?"
6, 93, "Leonardo", "The Macchina Magnifica? Infinity joy! Fry, my friend, you have given my life a meaning again!"
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "That calculus lecture was harder than I expected. We had to answer every question in the form of an opera. I have a lot of homework for tomorrow, if I don't want to be  Embarrassed!"
6, 93, "Fry", "Thank you. Thank you. And if you like that, you'll love our main event. Ladies and gentlemen, Leonardo DiCaprio!  I mean da Vinci!"
6, 93, "Leonardo", "For centuries, you've all ridiculed me. Especially you, Biff."
6, 93, "Biff", "Nice hat!"
6, 93, "Leonardo", "But, at long last, this invention will show you. It will show you all. Behold, my unstoppable doomsday machine!"
6, 93, "Fry", "And I helped! Wait. You told me it was an unstoppable ice cream machine."
6, 93, "Leonardo", "Ice cream is just a by-product of the machine. It's primary purpose is to exterminate everyone who ever made me feel inferior!"
6, 93, "Biff", "Oh, I'm so scared!"
6, 93, "Girl", "Bring it on, dum-dum."
6, 93, "Leonardo", "Oh yeah? Let's see how hard you are laughing when my doomsday machine chops off your face!"
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "Leonardo, stop!  I want in on this!"
6, 93, "Fry", "Are you crazy, Professor?"
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "I hate these nerds. Just because I'm stupider than them, they think they're smarter than me. Kill them all, starting with the math teacher!"
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "I knew this final invention would be a humdinger!"
6, 93, "Leonardo", "Yes, we three idiots will finally have our revenge."
6, 93, "Fry", "I don't think so! You two make me ashamed to call myself an idiot.  There's always going to someone smarter than you, so the only way to be happy is to make the most of what you've got."
6, 93, "Leonardo", "But you've got nothing."
6, 93, "Fry", "Oh no? I've got one single nail and another nail to nail it in with. And I'm gonna stop this infernal ice cream machine once and for all!"
6, 93, "Biff", "Some doomsday machine! It barely killed anyone!"
6, 93, "Leonardo", "Oh, yeah? Well, take this!"
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "Oh, my."
6, 93, "Girl", "Poor Leonardo da Vinci. He sure was stupid."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "Fry, I admire what you did today, and I'm deeply sorry for insulting your intellect. Your tiny, tiny intellect. Oops, there I go again, you dope. I mean, dummy."
6, 93, "Fry", "It's okay. I may not be clever, but I have a good heart. That's what my mom used to say."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "She was a wise woman."
6, 93, "Fry", "Also, that I'm not much to look at."
6, 93, "Farnsworth", "A wise woman, indeed."
6, 94, "Farnsworth", "I fear I may not survive this war reenactment. I can't believe we’re only twelve feet from the parking lot."
6, 94, "Fry", "This is every bit as fun as the real Civil War."
6, 94, "Leela", "Not the Civil War private. We’re reinacting the Sith-il War."
6, 94, "Fry", "Sith? What the Hoth?"
6, 94, "Bender", "Enemy invaders! Up in yonder sky!"
6, 94, "Darth Stroyer", "I am Darth Stroyer."
6, 94, "Fry", "Darth Stroyer? That’s the stupidest name I’ve ever heard."
6, 94, "Leela", "Let’s hear the rest."
6, 94, "Darth Trocious", "Darth Trocious."
6, 94, "Darth Sploder", "Darth Sploder."
6, 94, "Darth Urderer", "Darth Urderer."
6, 94, "Darth Ithead", "Darth Ithead."
6, 94, "Leela", "Company! Attack!"
6, 94, "Hermes", "Don’t fire until you see the greens of their eyes! It saves on bullets."
6, 94, "Darth Stroyer", "I shall rip out your heart and show it to you!  It is done."
6, 94, "Scruffy", "The candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long.  Mhrm."
6, 94, "Darth Sploder", "You're dead!"
6, 94, "Farnsworth", "No, I'm just very old."
6, 94, "Darth Sploder", "Woah! That's good acting!"
6, 94, "Fry", "It's payback time, Sploder!"
6, 94, "Darth Sploder", "Tell my mother... to pick me up outside Quiznos."
6, 94, "Hermes", "That's three dead. Uh-oh. Let's pick up the pace, people. At this point in the actual war, the death toll was ninety-eight million."
6, 94, "Bender", "You humans and your fragile organs. One little stab to the goo and"
6, 94, "Darth Trocious", "You're dead, Earth man!"
6, 94, "Bender", "Oh, cruel fate, I'm dead. They're putting me in my Sunday suit and shoving me in a wooden box.  Now they're loading me into cold, cold ground. Hello! Here come the worms!"
6, 94, "Fry", "If you were really dead, you wouldn't be laughing so hard."
6, 94, "Bender", "Yeah, yeah. Death's a big deal to you flesh bags. But in case you didn't notice, I'm a robot."
6, 94, "Fry", "So? What if something heavy fell on you, like a church? You could still die."
6, 94, "Bender", "Nuh-uh! My wireless back-up unit saves a copy of me every day. So, if my body gets killed, big whoop, I just download into another body. I'm immortal, baby!"
6, 94, "Amy", "What? Then how come you always scream so much when you're in danger?"
6, 94, "Bender", "I never said I wasn't a drama queen."
6, 94, "Hermes", "And the winner of the war is... let me just cross check my tabulation here. Factor in the corsages for the widows."
6, 94, "Bender", "Hurry up, you number-crunching crumb-nuncher! Everybody but me is dying of old age!"
6, 94, "Hermes", "Okay. The winners, at a net cost of only $12 per life cut tragically short, our Sith Overlords."
6, 94, "Darth Sploder", "Hot diggity! I mean...  Supreme diggity."
6, 94, "Fry", "It may have been a fake war, but my scuffed knee is all too real."
6, 94, "Farnsworth", "I have pain in joints I had removed a century ago. Bender, bring me my soft chair with the wheels on it."
6, 94, "Bender", "Your wheelchair?"
6, 94, "Farnsworth", "I don't need a wheelchair! The one with the wheels!"
6, 94, "Bender", "Poor flimsy humans. Don't you wish you were flawless like me? A towering inferno of physical perfection?"
6, 94, "Leela", "I hate to pop your blimp-like ego, but you're not perfect."
6, 94, "Bender", "Am so!"
6, 94, "Leela", "Are not!"
6, 94, "Bender", "Is too!"
6, 94, "Leela", "Says who?"
6, 94, "Bender", "Says the only human whose opinion I even remotely respect.  Inspector 5, the best inspector a kid could want. The day I was built, he looked me over, probably with tears of pride in his eyes, and proclaimed to all the world, by means of this scrap of paper, that I was perfect and infallible in every way!"
6, 94, "Farnsworth", "Hey, Mr. Perfect? You wet the chair."
6, 94, "Bender", "Huh? Wasn't me. Must be some of that urine your all so proud of."
6, 94, "Fry", "That's not urine, it's oil."
6, 94, "Bender", "Impossible! I'm triple sealed to prevent any chance of ..."
6, 94, "Zoidberg", "You call that an ink defense?  Goodbye, friends!"
6, 94, "Bender", "What could have caused the leak? Excessive heat, on the count that I'm so hot?"
6, 94, "Farnsworth", "Alas, no. Oh, Bender, I'm afraid it's a symptom of a fatal defect."
6, 94, "Bender", "Yeah, fatal schmatal. If I die I can just download my backup copy into a new, equally fabulous, body."
6, 94, "Farnsworth", "That's just it! You can't. You were built without a backup unit."
6, 94, "Bender", "There's no backup copy of me?"
6, 94, "Farnsworth", "That's what I just said, you mortal coil."
6, 94, "Bender", "So, if I die..."
6, 94, "Farnsworth", "You die. Or as you put it"
6, 94, "Bender", "Um, excuse me for a moment.   No!"
6, 94, "Bender", "I can't believe it! I'm gonna die."
6, 94, "Fry", "How much time does he have left, Professor?"
6, 94, "Farnsworth", "Between a minute and a billion years."
6, 94, "Fry", "Well, at least you can plan accordingly."
6, 94, "Bender", "Dying sucks butt! How do you living beings cope with mortality?"
6, 94, "Leela", "Violent outbursts."
6, 94, "Amy", "General sluttiness."
6, 94, "Fry", "Thanks to denial, I'm immortal."
6, 94, "Bender", "Damn it, I'm supposed to be perfect. Inspector 5 gave me his blessing!  How could he bring me into this world knowing I gonna die?"
6, 94, "Zoidberg", "So you wish you were never born, maybe?"
6, 94, "Bender", "Yes, anything less than immortality is a complete waste of time!"
6, 94, "Zoidberg", "Then suicide it is. Step into my office. I'll give you a nice Kervorking."
6, 94, "Bender", "Not until I hunt down Inspector 5 and beat an explanation out of him!"
6, 94, "Leela", "I'm all for a good beating, but you'll never find him. Product inspectors are bureaucrats, faceless bean counters who blend into the woodwork."
6, 94, "Hermes", "I beg to differ!"
6, 94, "Bender", "Stinking bureaucrats! I hate 'em."
6, 94, "Leela", "Then again, you might be able to find Inspector 5 with the help of another seasoned bureaucrat."
6, 94, "Bender", "Hermes, old pal!"
6, 94, "Hermes", "Old pal? 8.5 seconds ago, you said you hated me."
6, 94, "Bender", "Time heals all wounds."
6, 94, "Hermes", "You know what? I will help you, but only to prove I'm not just a paper-pushing file-jockey."
6, 94, "Amy", "Will you be taking your portable filing cabinet?"
6, 94, "Hermes", "None of your beeswax!"
6, 94, "Hermes", "I'll only be away an hour, but I'm counting on you to do the all-critical filing in my absence. Shall we review alphabetical order.  A, B, C, D..."
6, 94, "Leela", "Get out of my office!"
6, 94, "Old man", "Yes. I'd like to request a death certificate."
6, 94, "Woman", "Sorry. That's Building C."
6, 94, "Hermes", "The Central Bureaucracy maintains records on all bureaucrats. We should be able to look up Inspector 5."
6, 94, "Man", "Application for ingress approved.  And the other potential entrant?"
6, 94, "Hermes", "Uh, he's my pencil sharpener."
6, 94, "Bender", "You betcha!"
6, 94, "Man", "Proceed."
6, 94, "Hermes", "I maintain a cubicle here for weekend getaways."
6, 94, "Bender", "Wow! Until now, I thought giant cubes were exciting."
6, 94, "Bender", "I did like the part where they screamed."
6, 94, "Hermes", "This is mine. Right next to the center square."
6, 94, "Center Square Guy", "Sorry, Hermes. I drank all your white-out."
6, 94, "Hermes", "Once I log in, I can access Inspector 5's profile."
6, 94, "Bender", "Damn it! It won't go on."
6, 94, "Hermes", "That's because you're not me."
6, 94, "Bender", "Hooray! It won't go on!"
6, 94, "Hermes", "The bureaucra-scan won't let anyone but the assigned bureaucrat log in."
6, 94, "Computer", "Identity confirmed. Also, you have a rectangular mass in your colon."
6, 94, "Hermes", "That's a calculator. I ate it to gain its power."
6, 94, "Bender", "You locate Inspector 5 while I slip into my ass-kicking feet."
6, 94, "Hermes", "Sweet File-not-found of Puget Sound! His record's been blanked!"
6, 94, "Bender", "Aw, man! How am I going to find some anonymous guy I don't know anything about?"
6, 94, "Center Square Guy", "I recommend the men's room of the TWA terminal."
6, 94, "Leela", "Okay. Just filing alphabetically.  A, B, C, D...  Oh, this requires a little extra thought.  I'm a natural."
6, 94, "Hermes", "The information we need will be here, in the physical files."
6, 94, "Bender", "Those bastards won't know what leafed through them.  It's on!"
6, 94, "Hermes", "No! This is impossible! Quit blacking out and look at this. Inspectors 1, 2, 3, 4... 6. There's no trace of Inspector 5!"
6, 94, "Bender", "But 5's the one we want. Maybe if I kicked the asses of Inspector 2 plus Inspector 3..."
6, 94, "Hermes", "Addition never solve anything, man. Let's cut our losses and go home."
6, 94, "Bender", "So I'm doomed to die? And I'll never even get to punch whoever's responsible? Oh, what's the point."
6, 94, "Hermes", "Bender, no! Suicide isn't necessarily the answer!"
6, 94, "Bender", "It's not a suicide booth, you lard-ass. It's a phone booth."
6, 94, "Hermes", "They have phones in booths now? Finally, I don't have to lug this cellphone around."
6, 94, "Mom", "Who the hell is this? How did you get this number?"
6, 94, "Bender", "Is this the robot company? Cause I have a complaint about a defective robot. His name is me!"
6, 94, "Mom", "A defective robot, you say?  Stay right there, dearie.  I'll have tech support take care of you."
6, 94, "Bender", "Well, things are starting to look up."
6, 94, "Hermes", "Look up!  Who did you call? Dial-a-bomb?"
6, 94, "Bender", "No, I just told the robot company I was defective."
6, 94, "Hermes", "You dumb cocktail shaker! Mom won't allow a defective product to tarnish her good name! She'll kill you."
6, 94, "Bender", "Big whoop. I'll just download into a new... Oh, right. If I die, I die. Speaking of which–  You're right. You're right. You're right."
6, 94, "Mom", "That's what you get for calling tech support."
6, 94, "Bender", "I can't run anymore. I'll have to skip."
6, 94, "Hermes", "Just a few more feet. We have to get to that pile of dead bears by 7"
6, 94, "Bender", "A pile of dead bears can only mean one thing. But what?"
6, 94, "Hermes", "It's the 7"
6, 94, "Bender", "Aw, shoot!"
6, 94, "Killbot", "Someone said ""shoot!"""
6, 94, "Bender", "Well, we're boned!"
6, 94, "Hermes", "No, we're not! We just go to limbo!"
6, 94, "Bender", "But I'm not design to bend that low, not without limbo music.  That'll do it. Ow! Ow! Ow!"
6, 94, "Killbot 1", "We're gonna get fired."
6, 94, "Killbot 2", "Someone said ""fire!"""
6, 94, "Bender", "We did it!"
6, 94, "Hermes", "Twelve straight hours of limbo. I haven't done that since my honeymoon."
6, 94, "Bender", "Hermes! Hermes! Remember that flock of bats?"
6, 94, "Hermes", "I sure do."
6, 94, "Bender", "That was fun."
6, 94, "Bender", "Where are we?"
6, 94, "Hermes", "I have no idea."
6, 94, "Bender", "Hey. We're just a stone's throw from Tijuana.  See?"
6, 94, "Mexican Man", "¡Dios mío! A rock has fallen here in the outskirts of Tijuana."
6, 94, "Bender", "Is it within city limits?"
6, 94, "Mexican Man", "I think, yes."
6, 94, "Bender", "Told you!"
6, 94, "Hermes", "Hey, you wanna celebrate our escape? Maybe grab a shot of tequila and take in a big-league cockfight?"
6, 94, "Bender", "Sure. No, wait. I was built in Tijuana. Maybe Inspector 5 still works there. He better do some splaining. Before I mash up some face guacamole."
6, 94, "Bender", "He's Mexican, I'm Mexican. Let me handle this."
6, 94, "Mexican border patrolman", "Sus papeles, por favor."
6, 94, "Bender", "¡Sí!  Ouch-o!"
6, 94, "Hermes", "Here are our passports, visas, and Homeland Security permission slips, notarized and starched."
6, 94, "Mexican border patrolman", "Okay. I also would ¡ave accepted a bribe."
6, 94, "Bender", "Nice work, butterball. You know, I was in Italy last week."
6, 94, "Bender", "My birthplace. It's closed! There's not even a shrine to me. With a gift shop, selling piñatas of me!"
6, 94, "Hermes", "End of the line, man! Come on, we can still catch a twi-night double cockfight."
6, 94, "Bender", "No wait! What's that in the Mexican garbage?"
6, 94, "Hermes", "Looks like a half-eaten cheese diaper."
6, 94, "Bender", "No, next to that.  A half-eaten employee directory.  Inspector 5's home address.  His ass-ias is gracias!"
6, 94, "Bender", "Where are you hiding, you coward? Get out here and get murdered like a man!"
6, 94, "Hermes", "Bender, I'm afraid our search is at an end. He's obviously long gone."
6, 94, "Bender", "Oh yeah? Well, maybe this is him in a costume.  I'm gonna squeeze you out of there like Tijuana toothpaste."
6, 94, "Hermes", "Okay, Bender, you're mortal. And okay, Inspector 5 screwed up. But that just makes the time you have left all the more precious. Do you really want to waste the rest of your life in a bitter, homicidal rage?"
6, 94, "Bender", "No! Yes! I don't know!  Why? Why did he do this to me? All I wanted was a little quality control. But he didn't care enough. And now I gonna die. I deserve better! I'm Bender, damn it! I'm Bender!"
6, 94, "Hermes", "There, there, mon. It's gonna be okay. You are Bender, which is something Inspector 5 will never be."
6, 94, "Bender", "You know what? You're right. He was just a stupid bureaucrat. A stupid paper-pushing bureaucrat. A stupid I-dotting, chair squashing,  Oh. No offense, Hermes. You're not like that. I mean, you're exactly like that, but you're okay! In fact, I'm putting you on the do-no-kill list.  Come on, fellow mortal. We're in Tijuana. I wanna live a little.  Help, I'm gonna die! That's the opposite of what I want!"
6, 94, "Hermes", "Quick, run out the back! I'll hack into Inspector 5's terminal and fake your death, so they'll call off the Killbots."
6, 94, "Bender", "You know that terminal's unhackable! I'm not leaving you, and that's final!  Good luck, buddy!"
6, 94, "Computer", "Bender, terminated."
6, 94, "Hermes", "Bender saved."
6, 94, "Killbot 2", "Cease fire. Mom called off the attack, although I don't see how it's her–"
6, 94, "Killbot 3", "Someone said ""howitzer!"""
6, 94, "Bender", "Yeah! All right! Yeah!  He did it! And he's not even looking back at that cool explosion! He's a hero!"
6, 94, "Amy", "What's happening? The phone's been disconnected, the ship's been repossessed, and Zoidberg's getting overcooked!"
6, 94, "Bender", "Ah. This place never changes."
6, 94, "Hermes", "Leela! What in the name of Jah happened?"
6, 94, "Leela", "Too much papers! Not enough hiding plants!"
6, 94, "Hermes", "It's alright. This place just needs a one-hour bureaucratizing."
6, 94, "Leela", "You make it look so easy."
6, 94, "Hermes", "I've smoked a lot of paperwork in my day."
6, 94, "Fry", "Hey, Bender. Did you ever find that inspector guy you were looking for?"
6, 94, "Bender", "Nah, but thanks to this knucklehead, I did find a new outlook on life. It's precious and sacred, and you only get so many millions of years on this Earth. So let's get brick-faced!"
6, 94, "Hermes", ""
6, 95, "Bender", "Don't wake up Fry."
6, 95, "Bender", "My roommate's sleeping."
6, 95, "Bender", "Wake up already!  I'm about to get down and funky with this ladybot. And I'd appreciate it if as many people as possible could know about it.   Now can we get some privacy?"
6, 95, "Bender", "Ah yeah, backing on up."
6, 95, "Bender", "Hambone! Hambone! Hambone.  Okay, hambone break's over. Back to the bedroom."
6, 95, "Bender", "Hambone! Hambone! Hambone."
6, 95, "Bender", "Wake up and feel the coffee."
6, 95, "Fry", "Oh no! I'm late for work again!"
6, 95, "Fry", "Sorry, I'm late."
6, 95, "Bender", "Well, well, well. Look who decided to show up."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "I've had it with your tardiness, Fry. I expect you to arrive the same time as everyone else."
6, 95, "Fry", "Well, wait a second. Leela's not here yet."
6, 95, "Amy", "She left a while ago. She said some idiot were taking her to lunch for her birthday."
6, 95, "Fry", "Oh no! I'm late."
6, 95, "Elzar", "Since you got stood up, I thought this might cheer you up a notch."
6, 95, "Leela", "That's not necessary."
6, 95, "Elzar", "What day is today?It's Leela's birthday"
6, 95, "Leela", "Please stop."
6, 95, "Elzar", "What a day for a birthday"
6, 95, "Leela", "I really would like you to stop singing."
6, 95, "Elzar", "Let's all have some cake.  You want to buy a slice of a birthday cake for 11.95?"
6, 95, "Leela", "Yes, please."
6, 95, "Fry", "Ooh, nice cake. Sorry, I'm late."
6, 95, "Leela", "Where have you—?  Nah, it's fine."
6, 95, "Fry", "You're not mad?"
6, 95, "Leela", "I was. But then I realised it's actually my fault for thinking you might be on time for once.  Anyhow, I ate both our lunches. You ordered the Lobster Pilé. It wasn't cheap."
6, 95, "Elzar", "Bam!"
6, 95, "Fry", "Please, let me make it up to you. I'll treat you to a fancy birthday dinner tonight at Cavern on the Green."
6, 95, "Leela", "Wow. That'll be the nicest place I've ever been stood up."
6, 95, "Fry", "Not this time. No matter what happens, I'll swear I be there."
6, 95, "Bender", "Guys, guys! Hedonism bot is finally settling down and marrying a nice house in the suburb.  But tonight, he's having the girls gone wildest bachelor party of all time."
6, 95, "Fry", "Woohoohoohoo...  ... cares? I'm having dinner with Leela."
6, 95, "Leela", "Just go to your stupid party. We can have dinner on my birthday some other year."
6, 95, "Fry", "No. I can throw up on a stripper anytime. Tonight, I wanna not throw up. On you."
6, 95, "Leela", "Really?"
6, 95, "Bender", "Your loss.  Hey, Professor, you're my wingman."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "Very well. Eh, Cubert, fetch my drinking teeth."
6, 95, "Fry", "I just have to sign Leela's birthday card. How do you spell XO?"
6, 95, "Amy", "Guh. It's a record-your-own-message card. You don't sign it. You leave a nude video greeting."
6, 95, "Fry", "Does it have to be nude?"
6, 95, "Amy", "I guess not. That never occurred to me."
6, 95, "Fry", "If I leave now, record a birthday greeting on the way, score some fancy cologne at the newsstand, I'll be exactly on time!"
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "You're not going anywhere."
6, 95, "Fry", "But I have a date."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "You were late this morning. So you'll have to stay and test my latest invention.  Behold! A time travelling machine!"
6, 95, "Bender", "Time? I can't go back there."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "Ah, but this time machine only goes forward in time. That way you can't accidentally change history. Or do something disgusting like sleep with your own grandmother."
6, 95, "Fry", "I wouldn't wanna do that again."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "We're going to test it by going forward in time one minute.  Get in."
6, 95, "Fry", "Okay, hurry. Let's get it over with. I can record Leela's birthday card while we're in there."
6, 95, "Fry", "Happy birthday, Leela. I'm really sorry I'm gonna be one minute late, 'cause we're testing the professor's dumb time machine."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "Okay. I'll just nudge us forward exactly one minute into the—"
6, 95, "Fry", "My card!"
6, 95, "Fry", "Did we go too far? What time is it?"
6, 95, "Bender", "The year ten thousand!"
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "Whoopsie."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "Oh dear. I mean, oh my."
6, 95, "Fry", "The year ten thousand? But I promised Leela I'll be on time for dinner."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "Relax, Fry. Everyone we ever knew died thousands of years ago."
6, 95, "Bender", "Everyone we ever knew? Nah, I never liked those guys."
6, 95, "Fry", "No! They did it! They blew it up!  And then the apes blew up their society too. How could this happen?  And then the birds took over and ruined their society.  And then the cows. And then...  ... I don't know, is that a slug, maybe?  Noooo!"
6, 95, "Waiter", "While you await your  friend. Allow me to read from a prepared history of our cavern.  These unique rock formations were created over millions of years by mineral rich water dripping from pores in the ceiling. Dripping and dripping.  year on year,  century after century."
6, 95, "Elzar", "What day is today?  Hey, aren't you the loser who got stood up on my other restaurant?"
6, 95, "Leela", "Just shut up and bring me two dinners."
6, 95, "Leela", "Has anyone seen Fry's ass? It's late for a date with my boot."
6, 95, "Cubert", "Fry's not here. Obviously he went to that pervert party with Bender and the professor."
6, 95, "Leela", "Fry went to the party?"
6, 95, "Linda", "We interrupt Hypnotoad on Ice to bring you breaking coverage ...  ... of the disaster at Hedonism bot's bachelor party."
6, 95, "Morbo", "Linda, what began as innocent fun ended in tragedy tonight when a nuclear powered robot stripper suffered a catastrophic reactor meltdown. There is only one survivor."
6, 95, "Hedonism bot", "Everywhere I looked there were piles of bodies. And then the explosion struck."
6, 95, "Zoidberg", "The three coworkers I liked... all dead!"
6, 95, "Leela", "Fry stood me up and died?  I'm so angry.  I mean, I'm so sad.  But I'm still pretty angry.  But also sad.  Can I be both?"
6, 95, "Hermes", "It's what he'd want."
6, 95, "Leela", "Then that's what I am! Hi-yah!"
6, 95, "Bender", "Man, the future is a total craphole. Whoever lives here is a crapface sack of crap.  No offence, fellows."
6, 95, "Native #1", "Don't sweat it, man."
6, 95, "Fry", "I'll never see Leela again."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "No, without a backwards time machine we're stuck in this craphole."
6, 95, "Native #1", "Dude, give it a rest."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "Hold on! I got it. We can't go back in time, but we can keep going forward until people invent the backwards time machine."
6, 95, "Fry", "And then we can go home."
6, 95, "Bender", "Hit it."
6, 95, "Song", "In the year one-o-five, one-o-fiveIf man is still aliveIf robot can surviveThey may find In the year twenty-five twenty-five twenty-fiveThe backwards time machine still won't have arrivedIn all the world, there's only one technologyA rusty sword for practicing proctology In the future year that ends with a twentyA slumpy merman is gonna try to get chummyHe may look like a watery wimpWhen in fact he's a blood thirsty schrimp In the year one million and a halfHuman kind is enslaved by giraffeMen must pay for all his misdeedsWhen the tree tops are stripped off their leavesWoah-wow"
6, 95, "Old Hermes", "Sometimes I can't believe how successful Planet Express became once the professor was killed and you seized control."
6, 95, "Old Leela", "There were tough times. But we all pulled together."
6, 95, "Old Zoidberg", "I've been crunching the numbers on our transgalactic strategy—"
6, 95, "Old Leela", "What are you doing here? I laid you off twenty years ago."
6, 95, "Old Zoidberg", "Oh, the claws can't flee like they used to."
6, 95, "Old Leela", "Success is nice, but I do kinda miss the old days."
6, 95, "Old Cubert", "Hey, Leels."
6, 95, "Old Leela", "Hi, Cubert."
6, 95, "Male inhabitant", "May we help you, strange ones?"
6, 95, "Bender", "We are travellers from the past, my good runt."
6, 95, "Female inhabitant", "I see, since your time, human evolution has diverged."
6, 95, "Male inhabitant", "There are we; advanced in intellect and morality."
6, 95, "Female inhabitant", "And the Dumblocks; stupid vicious brutes, who live underground."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "Advanced in intellect, you say? Have you invented a backwards time machine?"
6, 95, "Female inhabitant", "No, but if we apply our superior minds, we can perfect such a device within five years."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "See you then!"
6, 95, "Bender", "We're back for our time machine."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "Yuhoo, boys! What's this era in human history like?"
6, 95, "Soldier #1", "The... the machines, we built them to make our lives easier, but they rebelled. They won't stop until every human is dead."
6, 95, "Bender", "This seems like a nice future. Let's just stay here. We can settle down on that mountain of skulls."
6, 95, "Bender", "Hey! That place had a gorgeous view of Blood Lake."
6, 95, "Lady #1", "Greetings, time travellers."
6, 95, "Bender", "Stupid jerks wouldn't let me stay in the good future."
6, 95, "Fry", "How do you know we're time travellers?"
6, 95, "Lady #2", "We too studied the time travel enigma."
6, 95, "Lady #3", "We have perfected a method using negative mass neutrino fields that allow us to travel backwards in time."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "My name's Hubert."
6, 95, "Fry", "All right! We can go home!"
6, 95, "Bender", "Nah-nah! We can go..."
6, 95, "Lady #1", "We can talk about our research tomorrow. Men are very rare in our society. Even very old and stupid males are priced.  Tonight, please be the guests of honour at our fertility banquet."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "Well, there is certainly no harm in a fertility banquet."
6, 95, "Fry", "I can eat. And fertilise."
6, 95, "Lady #1", "Very well, let us anoint our guests in oil without using our hands."
6, 95, "Bender", "Oh, so we can stay in the future you like? But not the future I like? Next!"
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "No! I was about to close the deal."
6, 95, "Fry", "Bender, they had a backwards time machine."
6, 95, "Bender", "The other place had a lot of good things too. Did you even see that mountain of skulls?"
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "Why you!"
6, 95, "Bender", "Oh no, you didn't."
6, 95, "Fry", "Stop. Somewhere, some time, Leela's waiting for me. We need to keep looking for a backwards time machine."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "Fry is right."
6, 95, "Bender", "Yes, we have to work together. Not have this fight which I was definitely winning."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "The year one billion."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "I got a feeling this could be exactly the point in time we've been looking for.  Nope.  In fact, all life is extinct."
6, 95, "Fry", "So let's keeping going forward."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "Oh, it's no use. Earth is dead. This is the end of all things."
6, 95, "Fry", "The Cavern on the Green."
6, 95, "Fry", "I made it, Leela. Sorry, I'm a billion years late."
6, 95, "Old Leela", "You'll get your alimony cheque, Cubert. Now get lost."
6, 95, "Old Cubert", "Chill out, I'm just here to see Amy."
6, 95, "Old Amy", "Move it, boy-toy. Granny's taking you to Atlantic City."
6, 95, "Old Hermes", "I don't know why you ever married that pig-nose punk."
6, 95, "Old Leela", "I don't know either. I'm married to the job now.  I used to think there was someone for me, but—  Aw!  How odd, it's one of those old record-your-own-message birthday cards."
6, 95, "Fry", "Happy birthday, Leela. I'm really sorry I'm gonna be one minute late, because we are testing the professor's dumb time machine. But you know, happy birthday and all and...  ... I love you.  My card!"
6, 95, "Old Leela", "My whole life I've been mad at him. And it wasn't his fault."
6, 95, "Leela", "Dear Fry, our time together was short, but it was the best time of my life."
6, 95, "Fry", "You know, all in all, I had a good life. What you say the three of us grab a six pack and watch the universe end?"
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "Hear, hear!"
6, 95, "Bender", "That's basically what I do every day."
6, 95, "Fry", "To the end of the universe."
6, 95, "Fry", "So long, Earth. Thanks for the air and whatnot."
6, 95, "Fry", "Hey, uh, what was the purpose of life anyway?"
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "Who knows? Probably some hogwash about the human spirit."
6, 95, "Bender", "Mm-hm."
6, 95, "Fry", "Sounds about right."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "The stars are receding. Oh, the vast emptiness."
6, 95, "Bender", "Yeah, yeah, I can take a hint."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "Ah, the last proton should be decaying about now."
6, 95, "Fry", "Bye, last proton."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "And...  ... here we are; the end of the universe."
6, 95, "Fry", "Well, now what? You guys wanna talk?"
6, 95, "Bender", "No thanks."
6, 95, "Fry", "Did anyone else see that?"
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "Unbelievable. It's a second big bang.  My God, is it possible?"
6, 95, "Fry", "It must be possible. It's happening. By the way, what's happening?"
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "It appears, this universe is exactly identical to the old one. If so, we just need to keep going forward in time to the point when we left.  The Earth is born!  Ladies and gentlemen, the moon."
6, 95, "Fry", "Look. The first fish to crawl up on land."
6, 95, "Bender", "It was coming right at us."
6, 95, "Bender", "You saw it."
6, 95, "Fry", "I'm gonna grab another beer."
6, 95, "Bender", "Fry, Fry, you're missing the dinosaurs."
6, 95, "Fry", "It's okay. They're not going anywhere.  Where'd they go?"
6, 95, "Bender", "Now what's going on there?"
6, 95, "Fry", "History."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "Hang on, I just want to make one stop."
6, 95, "Hitler", "Betrachten Sie meinen Schnurrbart."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "Easy. Easy. Taking her in for a landing."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "One year to go.  Six months."
6, 95, "Fry", "I'm almost there, Leela."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "One month.  Two weeks.  One hour.  Thirty seconds and here we—"
6, 95, "Fry", "Stop!"
6, 95, "Bender", "Give me the keys, Magoo."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "We'll have to bring her around again."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "Just slow it down, I'll shoot Hitler out the window.  Darn! I hit Eleanor Roosevelt by mistake.  Okay. Nearing our era again.  Here we go.  Careful this time.  Careful."
6, 95, "New Farnsworth", "We're going to test it by going forward in time one minute.  Get in."
6, 95, "New Fry", "Okay, hurry, let's get it over with."
6, 95, "New Farnsworth", "But, err, wha–?"
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "Oh uh."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "This new universe is about ten feet lower than our old one."
6, 95, "Farnsworth", "Pow. We took care of the time travel paradox."
6, 95, "Fry", "All right!"
6, 95, "Bender", "Yabba dabba doo."
6, 95, "Fry", "Oh uh, I'm late for dinner with Leela."
6, 95, "Waiter", "Welcome to Cavern on the Green. May I offer you some meatloaf while you wait?"
6, 95, "Fry", "Sorry, I'm late."
6, 95, "Leela", "Actually, you're on time."
6, 95, "Fry", "Really?"
6, 95, "Leela", "I have to admit, I was afraid you wouldn't make it."
6, 95, "Fry", "That was the old Fry. He's dead now."
6, 95, "Fry", "Happy birthday, Leela. I got you a card, but I guess I kinda lost it."
6, 95, "Leela", "That's okay. I don't really like cards. What I'll remember is our time together."
6, 96, "Leela", "Aw! Nibbler made a bobo for Mamma. I'll pick it up with my super-dupey poopy scoopy."
6, 96, "Amy", "Core magnetic field, 31 microteslas."
6, 96, "Prof. Farnsworth", "Nice."
6, 96, "Amy", "Temperature? Woah! The magma P.I. is 10,000 degrees Selleck!  Leela, I am collecting data. Can't you dump that somewhere else?"
6, 96, "Leela", "Not really. It's highly volatile Dark Matter, and some corn."
6, 96, "Amy", "But I'm presenting my thesis tomorrow and I've barely had time to prepare."
6, 96, "Farnsworth", "Nonsense. You've been my grad student for twelve years. You were ready six years ago."
6, 96, "Amy", "What?"
6, 96, "Farnsworth", "I probably should have told you. Anyway, the important thing is to be relaxed tomorrow."
6, 96, "Amy", "Are you sure?"
6, 96, "Farnsworth", "Yes. Do what you young people do to unwind. Take a joyride in your jalopy. Wear a T-shirt and eat a fish stick. Go!"
6, 96, "Kif", "Okay, amigos, one teensy drink to help Amy relax."
6, 96, "Amy", "Hmmm. I guess I'm still kinda nervous."
6, 96, "Leela", "One more teensy drink to help Amy relax."
6, 96, "Fry", "Still a little nervous?"
6, 96, "Bender", "She's a nervous wreck!"
6, 96, "Leela", "Well, I may not have a man, but at least I've got you, poopsie-doodle."
6, 96, "Nibbler", "Leela, it's time you and I had a talk."
6, 96, "Leela", "A talk? You can't break up with me. You're my pet!"
6, 96, "Nibbler", "As much as I enjoy being the object of your misplaced affections, I am also a highly sophisticated being who longs for intelligent conversation."
6, 96, "Leela", "Aw, is shnookums not feeling schtimuwated?"
6, 96, "Nibbler", "An understatement, to say the least. It's time you treated me with respect."
6, 96, "Leela", "If you want to be treated like a fellow crew member, fine, but no more purse rides, and no more dressing you up in your cute little sailor suit."
6, 96, "Nibbler", "I keep telling you, that's my real naval uniform."
6, 96, "Kif", "Your place or mine?"
6, 96, "Amy", "Both, but first, this place."
6, 96, "Hedonism Bot", "Ooh! Room for one more?"
6, 96, "Amy", "I thought I set you for 7"
6, 96, "Alarm Clock", "Sorry, I hooked up with Bender last night. Dude was all over my snooze button."
6, 96, "Amy", "But my doctoral exam is in ten minutes! On Mars!  Eww! Kif, did you yack on the floor?"
6, 96, "Kif", "Yes, I did."
6, 96, "Morris Katz", "Where's your candidate, Farnsworth. I have a long list of students to humiliate today.  You're late, Miss Wong."
6, 96, "Amy", "Oh, God, this is like one of those nightmares."
6, 96, "Farnsworth", "Here, take my lab coat."
6, 96, "Katz", "Allow me to introduce your examining committee in descending  order of grumpiness. Professor Ogden Wernstrom."
6, 96, "Farsnworth", "Wernstrom!"
6, 96, "Katz", "Downtown Professor of Applied Physics, Ethan 'Bubblegum' Tate."
6, 96, "Tate", "I see by your curriculum vitæ that you're a Sagittarius."
6, 96, "Katz", "And Professor Fisherprice Shpeekenshpell."
6, 96, "Shpeekenshpell", "The cow says... Moo."
6, 96, "Farnsworth", "He proved that 50 years ago, and he's been coasting on it ever since."
6, 96, "Katz", "I am the esteemed Professor Morris Katz, and you are wasting my time. Proceed."
6, 96, "Amy", "Imagine, if you will..."
6, 96, "Katz", "Oh, God!"
6, 96, "Amy", "A gigantic spherical generator, one that could provide unlimited energy, because it's essentially in Perpetual Motion."
6, 96, "Wermstrom", "Young lady, have you been drinking?"
6, 96, "Amy", "Well, yes, but that's not revelant. I'm talking about Earth. Earth's the generator.  Suppose this basketball is the whole world."
6, 96, "Tate", "To many young men in the inner city, it is."
6, 96, "Amy", "As it spins, it's producing an enormous magnetic field. If we could use that field to generate electric current, we could actually harness the Earth's rotational ener... Ener..."
6, 96, "Farnsworth", "Yes, tapping the Earth's ener-kerchoo. Go on."
6, 96, "Amy", "Sorry, I'm super-allergic to cats. Professor Katz, would you mind."
6, 96, "Katz", "Miss Wong, I mind everything."
6, 96, "Amy", "You just need to polarize the Earth's core with a huge static charge,  by ratcheting Superconducting wire down into...  Sorry."
6, 96, "Katz", "Enough. The committee members will now vote yea or nay. Nay."
6, 96, "Wernstrom", "Nay."
6, 96, "Tate", "Hell nay."
6, 96, "Shpeekenshpell", "The horse says, doctorate denied."
6, 96, "Fry", "It's okay, Amy. I don't have a fancy degree either, but today I'm a prominent boy in the package delivery field."
6, 96, "Nibbler", "Now that I'm a full and equal member of the crew, I pledge my loyalty, my perspicacity, and, dare I say it, my friendship."
6, 96, "Hermes", "Leela, muzzle that skunk! We can't stop a meeting for some cute, fuzzy, little...  Hey, look, a kitty cat."
6, 96, "Amy", "You again?  Get away you mangy ball of Histamines."
6, 96, "Hermes", "You leave kitty cat alone!"
6, 96, "Farnsworth", "People, please, I'm trying to run a business, so I get to hold kitty."
6, 96, "Fry", "Over here. I wanna hold him."
6, 96, "Bender", "Aw! Its anus looks like an asterisk."
6, 96, "Leela", "Captain Fuzzytoes reporting for duty. I mean, cutie."
6, 96, "Nibbler", "My best friend died in that uniform. I hate that cat!"
6, 96, "Amy", "If I had a spray bottle, I'd give him such a spritzing."
6, 96, "Nibbler", "I'll tell you one thing. Nothing acts that cute without some ulterior motive."
6, 96, "Amy", "Aw! You want your diapey changed?"
6, 96, "Nibbler", "We'll have to watch its every move.  Powder, please."
6, 96, "Amy", "Here's my new theory. That is one adorable cat."
6, 96, "Nibbler", "I guess I was just jealous. I do miss being Leela's schnookums. I'm going to apologize and hope for a pity pet."
6, 96, "Leela", "Yes, my lord. Amy and Nibbler are a tewwible thweat. They must be spayed and neutered, wespectivewy."
6, 96, "Amy", "The cat is evil! We have proof!"
6, 96, "Nibbler", "It was summoning a saucer!"
6, 96, "Farnsworth", "Of course it wanted a saucer, you idiot. A saucer of dewicious cweam."
6, 96, "Nibbler", "You fool, this isn't about the cream."
6, 96, "Bender", "It's pwonounced ""cweam""."
6, 96, "Zoidberg", "I'm petting mine down to the bone."
6, 96, "Fry", "Just stwoke its fwffy fur."
6, 96, "Hermes", "Scwatch its fwubby chin."
6, 96, "Bender", "Fweeble its fwooby pwow."
6, 96, "Amy", "No, no!"
6, 96, "Nibbler", "What do cats need with that much yarn and cobalt?"
6, 96, "Amy", "They're doing something downstairs. We've got to find out what."
6, 96, "Bender", "Where do you think you're going, no-cat?"
6, 96, "Amy", "Uh, the basement. I think I left the air hockey table on."
6, 96, "Bender", "Without a cat, you ain't going nowhere."
6, 96, "Nibbler", "Can you at least tell us what's going on down there?"
6, 96, "Farnsworth", "We're certainly not building something sinister, if that's what your implying. Now, come on, Bender. Something sinister won't build itself."
6, 96, "Amy", "Professor Katz's last name is Katz. Do you think he has something to do with these cats?"
6, 96, "Nibbler", "The conclusion is an inescapable as it is moronic.  I say we pay him a visit, and if he won't talk to us, he'll talk to Smith & Wesson,  or, perhaps, Consolidated Head Melter."
6, 96, "Amy", "Professor Katz, we want answers!"
6, 96, "Nibbler", "I warn you, if I have to get cute, it's gonna get ugly."
6, 96, "Amy", "He's dead!"
6, 96, "Nibbler", "Wait. What are these strings on his lap?  What the... He isn't dead. He's one of those dog-operated puppets that's been adapted for use by a cat!"
6, 96, "Amy", "So I had my doctorate denied by that fuzzball?  Bad kitty!"
6, 96, "Amy", "They actually built the planetary ratchet from my thesis!  Uh-oh."
6, 96, "Nibbler", "What the..."
6, 96, "Thubanian Leader", "Well, look what the me dragged in."
6, 96, "Nibbler", "You can talk!"
6, 96, "Thubanian Leader", "You can talk?"
6, 96, "Nibbler", "How ironic. Two hyper-intelligent beings both pretending to be simple house pets!"
6, 96, "Thubanian Leader", "Say, do you know Obliteron? He pretends to be a hamster, but..."
6, 96, "Amy", "Yeah, that's really great. Could you please tell us what's going on?"
6, 96, "Thubanian Leader", "What? Oh, right! You see, my associates and I are from the ninth planet of the star you call Thuban. Long ago, life there was ideal. [Flashback"
6, 96, "Nibbler", "Earth!"
6, 96, "Thubanian Leader", "Indubitably. Although we call it Blue Blue Shiny Ball.  In the area now known as Egypt, my people constructed a giant, semi-octahedral antenna to beam Earth's rotational energy to Thuban."
6, 96, "Amy", "The Great Pyramid at Giza!"
6, 96, "Thubanian Leader", "Yes. The Egyptians viewed us as gods, but ironically that was our downfall.  They pampered us with feasts most fancy and vittles most tender. We grew fat and domesticated.  Thousands of years passed, and our home world was nearing total destruction.  But the technology to save our planet was lost. Lost, that is, until I heard you speak at Mars University."
6, 96, "Amy", "So you called my thesis a fat sack of barf, and then you stole it?"
6, 96, "Thubanian Leader", "Welcome to Academia."
6, 96, "Nibbler", "He intends to siphon off Earth's rotational energy!"
6, 96, "Amy", "Earth will come to a stop, and..."
6, 96, "Thubanian Leader", "Half of you will cook, and half of you will freeze. Earth will be one big McDLT. We just got that commercial last year."
6, 96, "Amy", "Oh, yeah, smarty paws? You may have built the ratchet but you can't reach the core without 4,000 miles of superconducting wire.  The ball of yarn!"
6, 96, "Thubanian Leader", "Quite."
6, 96, "Nibbler", "Even so, you'd still need a tremendously powerful static charge to trigger the process."
6, 96, "Thubanian Leader", "Ever had a cat rub up against you?"
6, 96, "Nibbler", "If you're propositioning me, I'm not interested."
6, 96, "Thubanian Leader", "I'm talking about the charge generated when 50,000 felines rub against a single surface. Professor?"
6, 96, "Thubanian Leader", "Soon the world will come to a stop, and there's nothing you can do to stop it. The stopping of the world, that is. It's unstoppable.  Excuse me."
6, 96, "Thubanian Leader", "The Earth is coming to a stop. Keep your eyes on the kitties and push!"
6, 96, "Nibbler", "These space cats seem to be employing some form of hypnotic hyper-cuteness. Well, two can play that game. And one of them is me."
6, 96, "Leela", "Nibbler? Poopsie-doodle?"
6, 96, "Thubanian Leader", "Mr. Winkles, Smudge-Smudge. Quick, dance with each other."
6, 96, "Nibbler", "Aw!  Damn, they are good."
6, 96, "Thubanian Leader", "We're coming to a full stop. All cats, to your posts!"
6, 96, "Calculon", "Catastrophe Beach Party. Scene One. Cue disaster effects, and action!"
6, 96, "Calculon", "Cut! That extra looked at the camera. We'll have to do it again."
6, 96, "Thubanian Leader", "And now to transfer your planet's rotational energy to my home world."
6, 96, "Thubanian", "Well, now, this calls for a celebration."
6, 96, "Hermes", "What's all this cat hair on my sweater?"
6, 96, "Bender", "And why am I full of sand? And Tootsie Rolls?"
6, 96, "Nibbler", "You were all under the spell of those obnoxious space cats."
6, 96, "Thubanian Leader", "Enjoy being broiled alive by the Sun and also the dead bird we've left in your slipper."
6, 96, "Farnsworth", "Quickly! If we turn the ratchet the other way, perhaps we can restart the Earth."
6, 96, "Hermes", "It won't turn. Push harder, Bender!"
6, 96, "Bender", "I can't. You should have called my cousin, Turner."
6, 96, "Amy", "It's hopeless. Even in theory the device can only apply force in one direction."
6, 96, "Fry", "Can someone open a window? It's getting a little warm in here."
6, 96, "Bender", "Is that better?"
6, 96, "Amy", "Shmezzus, it's hot! Why'd I have to invent that awful device?"
6, 96, "Farnsworth", "Amy, technology isn't intrinsically good or evil. It's how it's used. Like the death ray."
6, 96, "Amy", "Maybe you're right. I guess that science has to keep pushing forward with the hope that...  That's it! Pushing forward! Professor, I know how to restart the Earth."
6, 96, "Farnsworth", "You can't suddenly know something just by assembling a committee of words.  That's it. I'll assemble your committee!"
6, 96, "Amy", "The ratchet won't turn backwards, but what if we kept pushing it forward?  Earth would start turning again."
6, 96, "Wernstrom", "Yes, the wrong direction!"
6, 96, "Amy", "So?"
6, 96, "Tate", "Gentlemen,  ladies,  let's get this globe trotting."
6, 96, "Amy", "It's working! Just a little faster!"
6, 96, "Zoidberg", "But we're plotzing here!"
6, 96, "Amy", "Then look at Nibbler!"
6, 96, "Thubanian Leader", "On the whole, Earth's society is worthless. But they do these things called antique rugs that are great for peeing on."
6, 96, "Farnsworth", "And though the world is now spinning in the wrong direction, it's good enough. Well done, Amy."
6, 96, "Wernstrom", "I'm honored to begrudgingly present you with your Ph.D. in applied physics."
6, 96, "Tate", "Also, some kind of sportsmanship award I had in my glove compartment."
6, 96, "Amy", "Yay! I'm finally done with school. How's the job market?"
6, 96, "Shpeekenshpell", "Ruff!"
6, 96, "Farnsworth", "Congratulations, Dr. Wong!"
6, 96, "Kif", "Congratulations."
6, 96, "Nibbler", "Permission to come aboard?"
6, 96, "Leela", "Granted, schnookums."
6, 96, "Farnsworth", "You've got a bright future, Amy. As sure as the Sun sets in the east."
6, 97, "Hermes", "Item one... Duck!"
6, 97, "Prof. Farnsworth", "Cubert, you crapscallion! What aren't you in school?"
6, 97, "Cubert", "I couldn't get past the protesters. A bunch of smiling, angry people were handing out these anti-evolution flyers."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Evolution is under attack in our schools? To the science mobile."
6, 97, "Leela", "You mean the ship?"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Yes. The science mobile!"
6, 97, "Leela", "It's just that you've never called it that before, but okay."
6, 97, "Woman", "I don't understand evolution, and I have to protect my kids from understanding it! We will not give in to the thinkers!"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "You people are as loud as you are ignorant. Now, get back on your turnip trucks and go home!"
6, 97, "Hydroponic farmer", "That is an insultingly accurate stereotype, sir!"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "As a professor of science, I assure you that we did, in fact, evolve from filthy monkey-men."
6, 97, "Dr. Banjo", "I cannot speak for you, sir, but my ancestors were not monkeys. They were orangutans. Hard-working, patriotic orangutans."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Dr. Banjo?"
6, 97, "Dr. Banjo", "In the fur. And I remind you that evolution is merely a theory. Like gravity, or the shape of the Earth."
6, 97, "Flying Spaghetti Monster", "Hey, Professor, I'm a Flying Spaghetti Monster. You seriously believe I've descended from some kind of flightless manicotti?"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Yes!"
6, 97, "Banjo", "Oh, please. A far more logical explanation is the undisprovable science of Creatureism. All life was created in its present form seven thousand years ago, by a fantastical creature from outer space!"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Bunk!"
6, 97, "Banjo", "Oh!  If you elitist, East Coast evolution is real, why has no one found the missing link between modern humans and ancient apes?"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "We did find it!  It's called Homo erectus!"
6, 97, "Banjo", "Then you have proven my case, sir, for no one has found a link between apes and this Homo erectus."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Yes, they have!  It's called Homo habilis!"
6, 97, "Banjo", "Ah-ha! But no one has found the missing link between ape and this so called Homo habilis."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Yes, they have!  It's called Australopithecus africanus!"
6, 97, "Banjo", "Oh-ho! I've got you now!  Fair enough, but where, then, is the missing link between apes and this Darwinius masillae? Answer me that, Professor!"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Okay, granted, that one missing link is still missing, but just because we haven't found it doesn't mean it doesn't exist!"
6, 97, "Banjo", "Things don't exist simply because you believe in them. Thus sayeth the Almighty Creature in the Sky!"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "I'll show that banana-swilling, poop-slinger! We just need to find that last missing link."
6, 97, "Leela", "I found a missing link. It seems to be half-man, half-toucan."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Not what we're looking for. Throw it in the soup!"
6, 97, "Hermes", "And here's something.  Uh-oh. It's another one of Fry's dogs."
6, 97, "Fry", "Did you find something, Hermes?"
6, 97, "Hermes", "No."
6, 97, "Amy", "I hate chiseling right after a manicure. Oh! Darn it! I broke off one of my fingers!"
6, 97, "Zoidberg", "Look, Cubert. The neck on this one. I bet he spent a fortune on ties!  What, too soon?"
6, 97, "Cubert", "I highly doubt a Jurassic Elaphrosaurus has access to neckwear."
6, 97, "Zoidberg", "I knew I should have gone with the ring-around-the-collar joke."
6, 97, "Bender", "Hey, look! I found a robot fossil!"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "That's a bedspring, you dumb bedspring! There are no robot fossils!"
6, 97, "Bender", "What? Who says I didn't evolve?"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Everybody! Robots were created quite recently. It was in all the papers."
6, 97, "Bender", "Then explain this!"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "I've hit a rich vein of missing links. Java Man, Piltdown Man, Manfred Mann.  Eureka!  It's the elusive missing missing link! This will show Banjo, once and for all!"
6, 97, "Fry", "What the..."
6, 97, "Amy", "Oh, that's mine."
6, 97, "Bender", "Hmm, my tux doesn't fit. Probably because I've grown so much since I last wore it, or evolved, one might say."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "One might not say that! Your tux doesn't fit because you stole it from a boy!"
6, 97, "Bender", "You mean a man! It was his Bar Mitzvah."
6, 97, "Ben Beeler", "Welcome, museum members. Or, as I like to call you, future exhibits."
6, 97, "Zoidberg", "He's good."
6, 97, "Beeler", "Tonight, we have a new resident here in the hall of Hominids, generously donated by its discoverer, Hubert Farnsworth. Ladies and gentlemen, Homo farnsworth."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Once again, science saves the day. The end."
6, 97, "Beeler", "And now, to discuss the scientific implications of this discovery, our new museum curator, Dr. Banjo!"
6, 97, "Banjo", "Thank you Professor Farnsworth, for your generous gift, which has, once and for all dis-proven evolution.  Behold! Homo farnsworth frolicking with dinosaurs at the moment of creation."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "I don't want to live on this planet anymore."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Faster! Faster! Just drop me off at that asteroid over there."
6, 97, "Leela", "Wow, this planetoid is completely lifeless."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Not lifeless enough! Set up my shack so that I can kick you out of it!"
6, 97, "Fry", "Professor, is this your only water source? It looks like Diet Dr. Pepper."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "It's not that bad. It's just laden with toxic minerals. But not for long."
6, 97, "Fry", "What's in the tube?"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Microscopic Nanobots.  They're tiny robots I designed to eat up nasty irritants."
6, 97, "Fry", "Speaking of nasty irritants, what's going to become of Cubert?"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Who? Oh, my son. Don't worry, he's been safely abandoned with his godfather."
6, 97, "Zoidberg", "Cubert,  I felt we needed some father-son bonding time, so I found a couple of  baseball gloves and boiled them up for lunch."
6, 97, "Cubert", "Why don't you just go to Hell!"
6, 97, "Zoidberg", "Wait! We still have to discuss the facts of life. What are they?"
6, 97, "Hermes", "Okay, I finished moving the last grand piano. Now can we have our pizza?"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "You'll get your damned pizza, you parasite! First, let see if my Nanobots have purified the water yet.  Ah, the water's as sterile as my milkman-trusting father. But what's this? The Nanobots have gotten more complex."
6, 97, "Bender", "What's that you say? Those robots have evolved all by themselves, you say?"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "It wasn't by themselves! I put them there. I'm a genius. Get over it!"
6, 97, "Amy", "Hey look, now they gotten bigger."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Good heavens! Trilobots!"
6, 97, "Leela", "Oh, no! My sunglasses were in there!"
6, 97, "Hermes", "Let's get the pizza out of here."
6, 97, "Amy", "Look, there's a cave-like hole in that mountain. It might be a cave."
6, 97, "Leela", "Does anyone have a lighter?"
6, 97, "Bender", "Hang on."
6, 97, "Leela", "Okay, we've got shelter and just enough precious food to ward off starvation."
6, 97, "Hermes", "It's pizza time."
6, 97, "Amy", "Pineapple?"
6, 97, "Hermes", "So much for that."
6, 97, "Zoidberg", "Hello, I remembered you like superheroes so I painted you a mural on your wall.  This is Father-Man. He fights crime to earn Son-Boy's respect. Is it working?"
6, 97, "Cubert", "This is sucky! You suck! Who taught you to do three-point perspective? I could make a better mural with my butt!"
6, 97, "Zoidberg", "Father-Man away."
6, 97, "Hermes", "Nothing like a cave for a good night's sleep. So what do we have to eat that's not poisoned with pineapple?"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "I packed plenty of food, but it's all in dehydrated pill form."
6, 97, "Leela", "Then we need water from that pond. We'll have to fight our way past the Trilobots.  Go! Go! Hit anything that moves!"
6, 97, "Fry", "Whoa."
6, 97, "Bender", "Wow."
6, 97, "Amy", "A whole forest grew overnight."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "All these trees are robotic. I can't believe how quickly they sprung up."
6, 97, "Bender", "I can. Robots do everything faster. Including evolving and believing how quickly things spring up."
6, 97, "Leela", "One thing about Bristol-Myers Squibb, they know how to cook a steak."
6, 97, "Fry", "Look at me, I'm the Ty-D-Bol man. I own a yacht an everyone poops on me.  Help! Police!"
6, 97, "Leela", "Everybody grab a club."
6, 97, "Fry", "Oh, big, tough water guy, why don't you come up here on land and..."
6, 97, "Amy", "Look out for the next thing!"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Great Scott, a Tricycle-tops!"
6, 97, "Fry", "Woo-hoo! Throw down dinosaurs of the land and sea.  This is a cool way to die!"
6, 97, "Cubert", "Dr. Zoidberg? I'm sorry for treating you like a total Zoidberg... I mean, loser."
6, 97, "Zoidberg", "Go on."
6, 97, "Cubert", "It's just that I get bullied a lot. I guess I kinda make fun of people as a defense mechanism."
6, 97, "Brett Blob", "Hey, Cubert, is that your family mansion?"
6, 97, "Cubert", "Why don't you ask your mom? She's coming over for a sex visit."
6, 97, "Zoidberg", "Don't worry, I know just how to handle bullies. Just pretend like you're pathetic. Help, I'm scared. I wet myself. I'm crying like a baby and I'm soaking in pee, but what else is new?"
6, 97, "Brett", "The pee-babies peed themselves. I'm off to pottery class, dorkwads."
6, 97, "Zoidberg", "And that's that."
6, 97, "Cubert", "Woah! You're like some kind of dumpster Jedi."
6, 97, "Zoidberg", "So, you wanna come in maybe?  I've got a nice pound cake with a footprint on it."
6, 97, "Fry", "Ah! Don't eat my butt!"
6, 97, "Leela", "If this is anything like killing that pigeon on my balcony, we've got our work cut out for us."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Look out, a solar flare!"
6, 97, "Amy", "What the shmell happened?"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "A mass extinction.  That solar flare created a huge electromagnetic pulse that while harmless to organic life, short-circuited the robo-dinosaurs."
6, 97, "Leela", "Convenient."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Only puny, mammal-like robots cowering in caves could survive such a catastrophe."
6, 97, "Bender", "Guys, guys! I taught myself to knit."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Wait a moment. If we could scavenge the right parts from these robo-dinos, I might be able to construct a rudimentary spaceship to get us off this planet!"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Oh, well, it took almost two hours, but it's finished.  Now let's go... to sleep. It's solar powered, so we can't take off until sunrise."
6, 97, "Bender", "Well, let's find something comfy to bed down on."
6, 97, "Fry", "Hey, looky here."
6, 97, "Hermes", "Sweet robot swan of Botswana!"
6, 97, "Bender", "Looks like the fittest did a little surviving last night, huh?"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Whatever."
6, 97, "Fry", "Hey, looky there."
6, 97, "Hermes", "Those robo-cavemen have kidnapped our human regular-women!"
6, 97, "Fry", "We gotta save them! But the only weapon we have is my fan dance."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Hmm, I believe I can fashion a slingshot using this robot wishbone and this elastic from my pants."
6, 97, "Amy", "I think they want wives, so just play along. If it doesn't work out, we'll still get half their rocks."
6, 97, "Leela", "I can earn my own rocks! Also, I don't want any rocks!"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Well, it took almost twelve hours, but it's finished."
6, 97, "Hermes", "It's too dark now, but first thing tomorrow we'll slingshot them like they've never been slangshat."
6, 97, "Fry", "What's going on? How did we save you?"
6, 97, "Amy", "It was the weirdest thing. We went to sleep, and when we woke up, our cave husbands were gone."
6, 97, "Leela", "I'm gonna miss Spencer."
6, 97, "Dr. Widnar", "Don't be afraid, little guys. I'm not gonna hurt you."
6, 97, "Fry", "Nice net."
6, 97, "Widnar", "You... you can speak?"
6, 97, "Hermes", "Dread my locks! A fully-evolved robot human."
6, 97, "Widnar", "I'm Dr. Widnar, a naturalist."
6, 97, "Bender", "And I'm Bender, baby. My human slaves and I come from a planet where organic life and robotic life evolved side by side."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Oh, shut up!"
6, 97, "Widnar", "Amazing.  I've theorized that carbon-based, fat-filled life could exist, but until today, I never had any proof."
6, 97, "Leela", "Good for you. Can we go home now?"
6, 97, "Widnar", "Welcome, museum members, or, as I like to call you, future exhibits.  I now present my latest discovery, the amazing non-mechanical man, Homo farnsworth."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Thank you. I must say, I'm so proud to see what you've blossomed into since I first created your ancestors."
6, 97, "Widnar", "What?"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "I thought you knew. You all evolved from some filth-gobbling Nanobots I designed. I dumped them in one of your ponds a few days ago."
6, 97, "Widnar", "But this is Creationist talk!"
6, 97, "Robot Farnsworth", "He speaks lies! The Earth was created in eons not days."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Yes, relative to you, it was eons, but, well, look at this hologram I took the day before yesterday of a robot frolicking with a robo-dinosaur."
6, 97, "Widnar", "I don't want to live on this planet anymore!"
6, 97, "Robo-Police", "You're under arrest for crimes against science."
6, 97, "Robot", "Go back to Roboklahoma!"
6, 97, "Superior Gort Judge", "Order! In the matter of Everyone v. Farnsworth, the alleged creationist faces a sentence of death by melting. Who is representing the accused?"
6, 97, "Leela", "I am..."
6, 97, "Bender", "I am, your Honor."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Bender, what the Hell are you doing?"
6, 97, "Bender", "Shut up, I'm billing you by the hour! Besides, I'm a robot, they'll listen to me.  Ladytrons and gentlebots..."
6, 97, "Superior Gort Prosecutor", "Objection. In the absence of pants, defense's suspenders serve no purpose."
6, 97, "Superior Gort Judge", "I'm going to allow them, for now."
6, 97, "Bender", "Thank you. Your Honor, this meat-man does not deny that we robots are the glorious products of evolution. He claim only to have played a small role in supplying the initial machinery. I ask you, is that so crazy? Yes, it's completely crazy, and that is why you must find him not guilty by reason of insanity!"
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Objection, I'm not crazy! I created you all and I came here in a homemade spaceship and lived in a cave. If you don't believe me, ask my uncle."
6, 97, "Superior Gort Judge", "Prosecutor, your opening statement?"
6, 97, "Superior Gort Prosecutor", "Yeah, honey. I'll be home by dinner.   The prosecution rests, your Honor."
6, 97, "Superior Gort Judge", "Very well, we will reconvene when the jury reaches a verdict."
6, 97, "Bender", "Son, you in a whole mess of trouble."
6, 97, "Superior Gort Judge", "Has the jury reached a verdict?"
6, 97, "Robotic gas forms", "No, we have not, for we have evolved to a high state of consciousness.  In the grand scheme, all physical beings are but yokels. Now, settle your petty squabbles and get the hell out."
6, 97, "Bender", "That'll be $10,000."
6, 97, "Banjo", "Well, digital photographs don't lie. I admit that what you witnessed may have been some form of evolution."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "I'm glad you agree, Dr. Banjo."
6, 97, "Banjo", "Evolution set into motion by a wise and all-knowing Creator. You."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Well I don't know about all-knowing. And I admit it's possible, however unlikely, that some wise and all-knowing alien monster set evolution in motion here on Earth."
6, 97, "Bender", "And the Creator could also be a robot."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Then who built this so-called Creator-robot?"
6, 97, "Banjo", "Some magical bearded robot in the sky?"
6, 97, "Bender", "I guess that would be stupid. Never mind."
6, 97, "Farnsworth", "Then it's settled. Finally, a world in which I'm happy to raise my son!"
6, 97, "Zoidberg", "Good, cause I'm sick of him!"
6, 97, "Zoidberg", "I'm serious. He's a terrible person."
6, 98, "Linda", "Tonight, at 11"
6, 98, "Morbo", "Doom!"
6, 98, "Leela", "Boy, that thing's big. Fry, is my colossal eye too big?"
6, 98, "Fry", "No, it's what makes you you."
6, 98, "Leela", "But it's so round, so hideously round."
6, 98, "Fry", "Leela, listen. You're the most beautiful woman I've ever known."
6, 98, "Leela", "Oh. So you only care about my looks?"
6, 98, "Fry", "No, I.... What?"
6, 98, "Linda", "Finally, New New York got a blast of class today as Nikolai, playboy ruler of the Robo-Hungarian Empire, arrived aboard his extravagant, caviar-powered yacht."
6, 98, "Nikolai", "I'm just a humble emperor, with a big, big crown!"
6, 98, "Bender", "Of course I'm not planning to steal that crown!"
6, 98, "Leela", "What?"
6, 98, "Bender", "True. I've always dreamt of being an emperor. You know, for Halloween, and then forever. But heisting those jewels would be difficult."
6, 98, "Leela", "You'd be stupid to try."
6, 98, "Bender", "I'll need accomplices. A sexy vamp to distract and tie up the guard."
6, 98, "Amy", "Never!"
6, 98, "Bender", "A claw man to slip past the metal detector and cut the alarm wires."
6, 98, "Zoidberg", "Sorry, I'm set for life after that last job."
6, 98, "Bender", "And finally, a chump, to be caught on video and later arrested."
6, 98, "Fry", "As I told you on Sucker-Punch Day, I'm through being a chump."
6, 98, "Bender", "Of course, it would all require split-second robotic timing. That's were I come in. You see, I own a watch."
6, 98, "Farnsworth", "There. This time I'm sure I've fixed the mind-switcher."
6, 98, "Amy", "Good, I'm sick of cleaning up those heaps of dead monkeys. But why would you want your mind in a new body?"
6, 98, "Farnsworth", "Well, as a man enters his 18th decade, he thinks back on the mistakes he's made in life."
6, 98, "Amy", "Like the heaps of dead monkeys?"
6, 98, "Farnsworth", "Science cannot move forward without heaps! No, what I regret is the youth I wasted playing it safe."
6, 98, "Amy", "I wasted my youth porking out."
6, 98, "Farnsworth", "Yes, I remember."
6, 98, "Amy", "Would you please take that down? It's making me hungry."
6, 98, "Farnsworth", "Funny, I could use a little extra meat on my bones.  Wait a second, if we switch bodies, I could live life to the extreme, and you could indulge your demonic food lust."
6, 98, "Amy", "We are just the people this mind-switcher was made for by us!  Wait, can I still change my mind?"
6, 98, "Farnsworth", "Let's find out."
6, 98, "Amy", "It didn't work you doddering old"
6, 98, "Farnsworth", "Ah! Cartilage! Dude, I bid you a fond cowabunga! I'm off to laugh at the Reaper.  Look out, world, here I...  I'm sorry, Amy, but your body is not up to the task. Also, I don't care for these boobs flapping every which way. Now quit your bologna-gargling and let's switch back to our original bodies."
6, 98, "Bender", "Body switcher, eh? Mayhap the heist is back on. Who needs accomplices, if I can just use their bodies."
6, 98, "Amy", "Professor, what's not happening?"
6, 98, "Farnsworth", "Bad news, me.  I failed to take into account the cerebral immune response."
6, 98, "Amy", "You idiot!"
6, 98, "Farnsworth", "Once two bodies have switched minds, they can never switch back.  However, perhaps they can. Maybe we can swap back using a third body for temporary storage space."
6, 98, "Bender", "I'm 60% storage space."
6, 98, "Farnsworth", "Eh, wha?"
6, 98, "Bender", "Well, I'm off to the royal yacht for a quick seduce-and-snatch."
6, 98, "Amy", "See ya!"
6, 98, "Farnsworth [in Bender’s body.]", "Now then, Amy, we'll simply switch bodies, and then we'll... we'll... No, I'd be back in my body, but then you and Bender would be switched. And the Amy and Bender bodies can't trade minds again, since they just did."
6, 98, "Amy", "Oh no! Is it possible to get everyone back to normal using four or more bodies?"
6, 98, "Farnsworth [in Bender’s body.]’’", "I'm not sure. I'm afraid we need to use... MATH."
6, 98, "Bender", "Stupid, air-needing lungs.  The crown jewels. Now I just have to locate the guard and seduce him in...  Four seconds?"
6, 98, "Basil", "Who goes there?"
6, 98, "Bender", "Three, two, one. Hello, big boy."
6, 98, "Basil", "Silence! I am Basil, the emperor's cousin and chief of his royal guard. And I shall not be seduced by a..."
6, 98, "Bender", "I said, ""Wow chica wow wow""."
6, 98, "Leela", "Professor, what's the matter."
6, 98, "Amy", "I'm Amy. The Professor and I switched bodies."
6, 98, "Leela", "Oh, lord."
6, 98, "Amy", "All I wanted was to gorge myself a little, but I can't digest anything with these false teeth and this hit-or-miss colon."
6, 98, "Leela", "At least, you get the senior discount at the movies. I hate paying $14 to see Nicolas Cage solve things."
6, 98, "Amy", "If you want to save $2, we could switch bodies."
6, 98, "Leela", "We could always switch back, right?"
6, 98, "Fry", "Hey, Leela. Mmm. What smells saturated?"
6, 98, "Amy", "Deep-fried ice cream sandwich wrapped in frosting and lightly baconed."
6, 98, "Fry", "Woah. That sounds like something Amy would say and eat."
6, 98, "Amy", "I am Amy. Leela and I used the Professor's mind-switching machine. [She puts ketchup on her ""creation""."
6, 98, "Fry", "So Leela's in your body?"
6, 98, "Leela", "Not exactly.  Aha! You do only like me for my body."
6, 98, "Fry", "That is entirely not true, sir!"
6, 98, "Bender", "Now to go switch bodies with Zoidberg, sneak past the metal detector and clip the alarm wires, all in less than...  Ten minutes ago! Oh!  Uh, could you come back when my chump gets here?"
6, 98, "Nikolai", "Now then, what is a filthy human doing aboard my royal yacht?"
6, 98, "Bender", "With all due respect, Your Majesty, I'm a robot like you. I just switch bodies with some bimbo. Go ahead, ask me something only a robot would know."
6, 98, "Nikolai", "Ah, a reverse Turing test, eh? Very good. What is the square root of nine?"
6, 98, "Bender", "Hold on, let me just get out a pencil.  Okay, look, I'm not that kind of robot. I'm more this kind. [He starts beat boxing and Moonwalking."
6, 98, "Basil", "He steps forwards but moves backwards."
6, 98, "Nikolai", "By the gods! he is a machine!"
6, 98, "Farnsworth", "No, that won't restore everyone, either. Besides, I don't want my decrepit old body back! I'm running away with this invincible robot body and joining something!"
6, 98, "Fishy Joe", "I paid for 15 Robot Clowns per cubic meter of car, and you're barely giving me 12. Now crumple up and get in... And fasten your seat belts."
6, 98, "Robot Clown", "Oh, come on!"
6, 98, "Farnsworth", "Good day. I am Nonchalanto, the robot daredevil. And my dream is to risk my life in strange and original ways."
6, 98, "Fishy Joe", "Hmm. You don't look so foolhardy to me."
6, 98, "Fishy Joe", "That's the dumbest thing anybody's ever done. Your hired!"
6, 98, "Nikolai", "So you’re a common bending robot with a human peasant roommate?"
6, 98, "Bender", "Oh, crap, that is what I am!"
6, 98, "Nikolai", "No, Bender, I envy you. I'm so bored with all of these pretentious trappings. The jewels, the parties, the beautiful robo women."
6, 98, "Princess Flavia", "Hello."
6, 98, "Nikolai", "My fiancée, Princess Flavia. Dearest, meet Bender. He's a robot in the body of a Chinese Martian physicist."
6, 98, "Flavia", "How tedious."
6, 98, "Nikolai", "Oh, to escape this gilded cage for a day."
6, 98, "Bender", "You know, we could trade bodies. I could take over the humdrum royal stuff and you could be an regular Joe for a day.  Or more. Much more."
6, 98, "Nikolai", "In that horrible non-robot body. Sir, I have my standards."
6, 98, "Bender", "Ah, but what if I could put you in my fabulous bending-robot body?"
6, 98, "Nikolai", "Me, posing as a lowly bending unit? How wicked! But wait, I'm supposed to give a speech at the UN tomorrow. Can I trust you to do it?"
6, 98, "Bender", "You can trust anything."
6, 98, "Hermes", "You aren't, are you?"
6, 98, "Fry", "Of course not! But I was willing to lie about it. What more can a man do?"
6, 98, "Hermes", "A man can give her a toke of her own medicine."
6, 98, "Fry", "Yes! I can put my mind in a hideous body and show Leela she's not attracted to me. But it would have to be a really, really disgusting body."
6, 98, "Zoidberg", "Friends! Friends! I've got barnacles on my tuchus!"
6, 98, "Hermes", "The long search is over."
6, 98, "Bender", "Wait here and earn interest while I find my robot body."
6, 98, "Bender", "Professor?"
6, 98, "Leela", "Leela. Amy?"
6, 98, "Bender", "Bender. Have you seen my body? I think the Professor's in it."
6, 98, "Leela", "Yeah, he said something about running away. Then he ran away."
6, 98, "Bender", "What? Wither?"
6, 98, "Bender", "What am I gonna do? I got an emperor all patsied up to switch bodies, but only with another robot!"
6, 98, "Wash bucket", "Wash bucket full."
6, 98, "Scruffy", "Scruffy's work here is done."
6, 98, "Bender", ""
6, 98, "Bender", "Now to find Emperor Von Richendoof."
6, 98, "Wash bucket", "Now to find Scruffy."
6, 98, "Zoidberg", "Switch bodies? I don't see why not. I also don't see why."
6, 98, "Fry", "In your face, Leela."
6, 98, "Nikolai", "If you're a bender, why is your body full of fetid water?"
6, 98, "Bender", "If you're an emperor, why don't you shut up? Move it, Fry."
6, 98, "Bender", "Well, so long."
6, 98, "Nikolai", "Wait! Point me to my normal human roommate!"
6, 98, "Bender", "That's him there, maybe.  Got to go!"
6, 98, "Zoidberg", "Robot?"
6, 98, "Nikolai", "Yes, 'tis I, Bender. Do you not recognize your own best friend?"
6, 98, "Zoidberg", "Aha! The guy in this body has a friend! Bender, old pal! It's me, the Fry!"
6, 98, "Leela", "But then Nicolas Cage discovered that the real treasure was his family. Yes, I'll hold."
6, 98, "Fry", "Hey, Leela, look! I'm in Zoidberg."
6, 98, "Leela", "Fry?"
6, 98, "Fry", "Oh, you're not so shallow that you find me repulsive because of my body, are you?"
6, 98, "Leela", "Not at all.  Amy, stop it! Fry, help! She's turning me into a parade float!"
6, 98, "Fry", "Eww! look at her!"
6, 98, "Leela", "Oh. So you're so shallow that my body disgusts you if it puts on a little extra weight?"
6, 98, "Fry", "That wasn't a little extra weight."
6, 98, "Leela", "Admit it! You don't care about the inner me at all!"
6, 98, "Fry", "No, you admit it! You'd be ashamed to be seen in public with someone as hideous as me!"
6, 98, "Leela", "Would not!"
6, 98, "Fry", "Oh, yeah? Then I challenge you to a romantic dinner at Elzar's tonight."
6, 98, "Leela", "It's on."
6, 98, "Hermes", "Sweet orca of Majorca! You make Fat Albert look like Normal Albert!"
6, 98, "Amy", "I don't know what to do. Do you think I should eat more butter?"
6, 98, "Hermes", "I am putting a stop to this, right now! Come on! We're switching bodies."
6, 98, "Amy", "Hermes, no! I'll ruin your body, too!"
6, 98, "Hermes", "Three decades of the munchies beat you to it."
6, 98, "Big Bertha", "You make quite a show, young man.  You remind me of myself as a young cannon."
6, 98, "Chainsaw-Eating Robot", "Big Bertha is the circus's grande dame. She shoots robots through the air."
6, 98, "Bertha", "Excuse me. Too much goulash."
6, 98, "Farnsworth", "I've always wanted to be shot out of something. How about a quick blast after lunch."
6, 98, "Bertha", "Alas, a fine big one like you would shatter my barrel. But, ah, to amaze the crowd once more."
6, 98, "Farnsworth", "I understand the problem of age, but suppose I could put you into a new body?"
6, 98, "Bertha", "Never! My body may be old, but it is mine, and every crack a memory of heavy things shot a long way. Good day."
6, 98, "Bender", "Ah! I have everything I every wanted. Money, wealth, riches. Yet something's missing. A hot princess with which to get(?) grizzly."
6, 98, "Flavia", "Hello."
6, 98, "Bender", "Hello, baby!  Huh? Hey, what's going on here? And why are you kissing my dashing cousin instead of me?"
6, 98, "Flavia", "Nikolai, you imperial fool! We've been having an affair for 700 years."
6, 98, "Basil", "At long last, I shall kill you, blame the burglar and inherit the throne."
6, 98, "Flavia", "Farewell, Nikolai."
6, 98, "Bender", "Wait! I'm not Nikolai! I'm Bender, the fabulous body-switching burglar."
6, 98, "Basil", "So you are. However, you do have Nikolai's body, and that's the part we want to kill."
6, 98, "Fry", "Great food, huh?"
6, 98, "Leela", "Ew!"
6, 98, "Fry", "I'm sorry, Leela. I hope that didn't make you ashamed to be seen with me."
6, 98, "Leela", "No, it only makes you more attractive."
6, 98, "Fry", "Ew!"
6, 98, "Leela", "Oh, did my bodily infirmity embarrass you?"
6, 98, "Fry", "Not at all. It's just another thing that makes you a very special lady."
6, 98, "Leela", "You mean, like my penis?  Eh!"
6, 98, "Fry", "Admit it! You're disgusted by me!"
6, 98, "Leela", "No, you're disgusted by me!"
6, 98, "Fry", "I'm as attracted to you as I've ever been!"
6, 98, "Leela", "Prove it!"
6, 98, "Zoidberg", "Well, Bender, here's our apartment that we live in everyday.  A floor? We live like kings?"
6, 98, "Nikolai", "Kings? Silence! Like you, I'm a common lout. Now fetch me some working-class cognac from our brandy storeroom that you know how to find."
6, 98, "Zoidberg", "Relax, Bender. I'll dry up that leak with this heating box."
6, 98, "Nikolai", "Ah, cigars. Light me up, old friend."
6, 98, "Robot", "There you are, Emperor Nikolai. It's time for your speech to the UN."
6, 98, "Bender", "The what now?"
6, 98, "Scruffy", "Miss Wong?"
6, 98, "Wash bucket", "No, Scruffy, I am wash bucket. I love you. Wash bucket has always loved you."
6, 98, "Scruffy", "It's wrong, wash bucket. Oh, it would be sweet for a while, but in the back of our minds, we'd know that I'm a man and you're janitorial equipment."
6, 98, "Wash bucket", "In another city, we could be anyone we want!"
6, 98, "Scruffy", "Go. Go now, before I beg you to stay."
6, 98, "Scruffy", "Yep."
6, 98, "Nixon", "Please welcome an insane dictator, and one heck of a bowler, Emperor Nikolai!"
6, 98, "Bender", "Thanks, Nixon. How we doing?"
6, 98, "Woman", "I love you, Your Majesty."
6, 98, "Bender", "Shut up, madam ambassador, I know it. Anyhow,  I'd now like to digress from my prepared remarks to say, ""I'm done""."
6, 98, "Basil", "Ladies and gentlemen, this robot is an impostor!  I shall enjoy this."
6, 98, "Bender", "Not me."
6, 98, "Chainsaw-Eating Robot", "That devil, Basil, will kill our emperor."
6, 98, "Farnsworth", "You're Robo-Hungarian?"
6, 98, "Robot Carny", "Yes. Our nation's chief export is carnies."
6, 98, "Farnsworth", "If only there was some way I could get to the UN to help."
6, 98, "Bertha", "There is. Get in, Nonchalanto."
6, 98, "Chainsaw-Eating Robot", "Bertha, no! It would kill you!"
6, 98, "Bertha", "I have not so much time left anyhow."
6, 98, "Farnsworth", "But you could get a new body! You could have a rich, full life!"
6, 98, "Bertha", "I am trying to have a rich, full life.  Long live Robo-Hungary!"
6, 98, "Bender", "Me! Thank God you've come!"
6, 98, "Farnsworth", "This is for Big Bertha.  That is not what I meant to give you for Big Bertha."
6, 98, "Leela", "That was nice."
6, 98, "Fry", "Oh, yeah."
6, 98, "Nixon", "Ow. Ow. Arrooo!"
6, 98, "Basil", "Whoever you are, you're the bravest robot I've ever seen.  I like killing brave things."
6, 98, "Farnsworth", "Good, because I've got 20 of them per cubic meter."
6, 98, "Boy", "When I grow up, I wanna be a diplomat!"
6, 98, "Bender", "Well, if they're is one thing I learned, it's a lesson. I believe this belongs to you."
6, 98, "Nikolai", "I shall sell it to help the common folk, now that I understand their misery."
6, 98, "Bender", "Yeah, good luck with that."
6, 98, "Leela", "I must say, Hermes, you've got a smoking-hot body."
6, 98, "Hermes", "I was inspired by Amy."
6, 98, "Leela", "Wow! How did you do it."
6, 98, "Amy", "Well, there I was at Elzar's, eating a nice pork sundae and suddenly, I just lost my appetite.  Forever."
6, 98, "Sweet Clyde", "Q to the E to the D!"
6, 98, "Farnsworth", "So it is possible us all to get back to our original bodies?"
6, 98, "Bubblegum", "Stone-cold munching, Prof. Sweet Clyde, characterize your inversion theorem."
6, 98, "Sweet Clyde", "Basically, no matter how permuted-up your minds are, they can be restored using, at most, two extra players."
6, 98, "Farnsworth", "And they say pure math has no real-world applications!"
6, 98, "Sweet Clyde", "Everybody back in their zones?"
6, 98, "Farnsworth", "Ah! My body may be old, but it is mine. Brilliant work, Clyde. You'll win the NBA’s highest academic honor for this."
6, 98, "Nikolai", "Also, I'm making you a duke.  So long filthy commoners."
6, 98, "Bender", "¡Adiós! And I'm left with the real jewels safely inside...  ...his compartment!"
6, 98, "Bender", "All right. I'll need accomplices."
6, 99, "The Scary Announcer", "You're taking a vacation from normalcy, the setting"
6, 99, "Announcer", "Submitted for your Emmy consideration, a popular Senator with unpopular ideas."
6, 99, "Senator", "There's no such thing as space aliens!"
6, 99, "Man", "Oh? How can you be so sure them aliens ain't already among us?"
6, 99, "Senator", "I'll tell you how!  Because you ARE ONE!!!"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Hey, I was watching that! The Saints just needed a field goal to tie!"
6, 99, "Ndnd", "Lrrr, you lazy ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8! You said you would conquer a planet today, but you have not even shed your skin yet!"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Yes, Ndnd. I heard you the first hundred times. I'll conquer something tomorrow after I fuel up on your disgusting egg-white omelets."
6, 99, "Ndnd", "You want yolks? Fine! Enjoy your stroke."
6, 99, "Fry", "Erth."
6, 99, "Invader X", "Ha ha ha! I am conquering Erth."
6, 99, "Leelis Lane", "Not so fast, Invader X! Here comes Delivery-Boy Man!"
6, 99, "Delivery-Boy Man", "Special delivery for Invader X! Laser eye power! [He shoots Invader X's ship with his laser eyes. The ship explodes. Cut to"
6, 99, "Leelis Lane", "Yay! I'm unbuckled! [Delivery-Boy Man uses his ""hand magnet power"" to bring Lane to him."
6, 99, "Invader X", "Stop it, you hero!"
6, 99, "Delivery-Boy Man", "Reverse-time power!"
6, 99, "Delivery-Boy Man", "It's earlier now."
6, 99, "Fry", "So? What do you think of my comic?"
6, 99, "Bender", "Let me put it like this. After I leave here, I'm getting a memory enema."
6, 99, "Leela", "If I may offer some constructive criticism, there was never any real peril. I mean, the delivery guy has, like, 30 superpowers."
6, 99, "Fry", "Well, that's because he was bitten by a radioactive superman!"
6, 99, "Zoidberg", "This is wonderful!"
6, 99, "Fry", "It is, isn't it? Wait, those are the ads."
6, 99, "Zoidberg", "These X-ray specs will really take the guesswork out of surgery. No more chopping blindly in the goop."
6, 99, "Prof. Farnsworth", "Don't waste your allowance, Zoidberg. This stuff is butt-grade crap."
6, 99, "Paper-hatted salesman", "Amuse your friends with real vomit!"
6, 99, "Man #1", "Throw your voice!"
6, 99, "Woman", "Sea monkeys!"
6, 99, "Man #2", "Throw your sea monkeys!"
6, 99, "Farnsworth", "My disintegrator ray really works!"
6, 99, "Amy", "But that's you."
6, 99, "Farnsworth", "That's how I know it's bunkum. The Farnsworth Novelty Disintegrator Ray is nothing more than a common teleporter ray.  Worthless toy."
6, 99, "Fry", "I'm sick of being critiqued by nitpicking nerds. I'm taking this to a comic book convention!"
6, 99, "Amy", "Smeesh, it's crowded!"
6, 99, "Bender", "Good thing everyone is freshly bathed and groomed."
6, 99, "Nerd", "What are you doing?  That's the rare Zapp Brannigan with recording session blooper!"
6, 99, "Action Figure", "Don't tell me how to do the line. It sickens me."
6, 99, "Zoidberg", "But the sign said there was a mint in the box."
6, 99, "Groening", "Thank you so... Okay, thanks... Thanks so... Settle down!"
6, 99, "Groening", "So, anyway, we're really excited to show you guys the pilot for our new TV series."
6, 99, "Cohen", "It's set it the year 4000, and we call it Futurella!"
6, 99, "Groening", "Wow. Fox has really streamlined the process."
6, 99, "Bill Morrison Robot", "Matt will now take questions. But please, only about Futurella, not the Simpsons. Yes? The robot standing on the small child over there?"
6, 99, "Bender", "Yeah, when are you going to make a second Simpsons Movie?  D'oh!"
6, 99, "Fry", "Mr. Aragonés, I'm a big fan of your cartoons and your mustache."
6, 99, "Aragonés", "You want it? Take it. It's brought me nothing but misery."
6, 99, "Fry", "Wow. Thanks! [He rips the mustache off Aragonés' face and puts it on. Aragonés screams"
6, 99, "Aragonés", "Señor, anyone who still writes comics is a hero to me.  Mmm. It stinks. But, um, I do like the tiny doodles in the margins."
6, 99, "Fry", "Oh, that's just some relish from a hot dog I found."
6, 99, "Man", "Attention, ladies and gentleboys, the costume contest is about to begin."
6, 99, "Bender", "The costume contest! The costume contest!"
6, 99, "Leela", "What the hell are you supposed to be?"
6, 99, "Bender", "Every nerd's fantasy, baby."
6, 99, "Randy", "Next up, contestant number 36!  Contestant 36, everyone. Next up, contestant 37..."
6, 99, "Lrrr", "I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet..."
6, 99, "Randy", "Hold on a second, let me just get this."
6, 99, "Lrrr", "I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8. You are hereby conquered! Please line up in order of how much beryllium it takes to kill you."
6, 99, "Grrrl", "Damn, that's a good costume."
6, 99, "Randy", "Next up contestant 38!"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "I don't understand. Why are the human still eating their soft pretzels instead of surrendering?"
6, 99, "Leela", "They're probably waiting for Joss Whedon."
6, 99, "Lrrr", ""
6, 99, "Leela", "Yeah, you almost ate me once. I was in your mouth for five minutes."
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Leela?"
6, 99, "Randy", "And the winner is, Nerdgasma!"
6, 99, "Bender", "Wooh, I've got fruit boobs!"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "What's the use?"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Now what?"
6, 99, "Ndnd", "I send you out to conquer a planet and all you bring back is J.J. Abrams' face?"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "I thought you'd like it. You haven't even tried it on."
6, 99, "Ndnd", "I might dress up in a face if you ever took me anywhere nice!"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Oh, boy, here we go. I built this castle with my own two slaves. What are you gonna to do, kick me out?"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8. May I crash on your couch?"
6, 99, "Farnsworth", "So he just showed up unannounced, raided the liquor cabinet, sprayed urine on the ceiling and passed out?"
6, 99, "Amy", "And the walls."
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Leave me alone. My wife hates me and planetary conquest has become a chore."
6, 99, "Farnsworth", "There, there. You're just having a mid-life crisis."
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Mid-life crisis, eh?  Lrrr demands the comfort of pop-psychological platitudes."
6, 99, "Bender", "Look, hoss, your wife threw you out. That's your license to be a jerk. Do whatever the hell you want then walk away and light a cigar. [He pulls a cigar out of his chest cabinet, lights it, and walks away."
6, 99, "Leela", "Don't listen to him, Lrrr. Bender may seem happy.  But in the long-tern, you need to reinvest in your relationship with Ndnd."
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Yes, it's clear what I must do."
6, 99, "Lrrr", "I like it."
6, 99, "Surgeon", "I'm thinking we downplay those hideous growths on your head."
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Horns are a sign of virility. Also, they house my testes."
6, 99, "Surgeon", "I'm thinking horn extension."
6, 99, "Bender", "You'll need some arm candy. It's the perfect accessory for out-of-shape, middle-aged creeps like you. Yeah, I said it! What's your time, Borgnine?"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Big and angry."
6, 99, "Bender", "Look, brah, you just not gonna find a whole lot of hot, gigantic Omicronian babes in this solar system."
6, 99, "Lrrr", "There's one!"
6, 99, "Grrrl", "Hey, cool cape. Were'd you get it?"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "What, this old thing? I murdered my father. My name's Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8."
6, 99, "Grrrl", "I am called Grrrl."
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Of the planet Omicron Persei 8? That is a pretty name."
6, 99, "Lrrr", "What's on the TV tonight? Oh, wait! I don't care, because I've got a date!"
6, 99, "Leela", "I know it's not what you want to hear, but I think this is a mistake."
6, 99, "Fry", "Leela's right. That's not what you want to hear. What you want to hear is that I fixed my comic book. Now the hero is more reliable because he has no more ridiculous powers."
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Let's watch, shall we."
6, 99, "Invader X", "One more step and little Miss Constructive Criticism here gets it!"
6, 99, "Delivery-Boy Man", "Oh, yeah? I may be just a simple delivery boy with no superpowers, so there's nothing I can do."
6, 99, "Invader X", "Okay."
6, 99, "Fry", "So? Give me your honest praise."
6, 99, "Leela", "Fry, I've now seen two comic books, so listen to me. Why should I care about the hero when all he does is cry?"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Hmm. That dinner was a worthy foe."
6, 99, "Grrrl", "Yes, we shall not see its like again. So, um..."
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Um, I'm sorry. I haven't done this for a while. I just got partway out of a bad relationship."
6, 99, "Grrrl", "Maybe I should take this off."
6, 99, "Lrrr", "You're a human?"
6, 99, "Grrrl", "Only physically. I'm a cross-species dresser.  Wait, you're an actual Omicronian?"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Oh, God. Oh God, what have I done?"
6, 99, "Grrrl", "This is so hot! Conquer me, Lrrr! Sharpen your horns on my scaly thorax!"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "I want to go home! But Ndnd would never take me back now."
6, 99, "Leela", "Ndnd just wants what every she-beast wants, to feel like you're listening to her nagging. Is there anything she has been riding your ass about?"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Conquering things, I guess. I could conquer Earth, kill all humans."
6, 99, "Bender", "There's a thought."
6, 99, "Leela", "No! We don't need a war of the worlds."
6, 99, "Fry", "That's it! We need a War of the Worlds! I'll call Orson Welles"
6, 99, "Bender", "Dork calling Orson! Dork calling Orson!"
6, 99, "Welles", "You're asking me, the renowned spokesperson for Paul Masson wine, to recreate my brilliant  1938 radio broadcast merely to deceive and impress the wife of this skinny reptile?"
6, 99, "Fry", "Sorry. Never mind."
6, 99, "Welles", "I do it for free."
6, 99, "Welles", "Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt our program of the Jonas Brothers and their orchestra to bring you a special bulletin. Welles"
6, 99, "Welles", "We interrupt our program of the Jonas Brothers and their orchestra to bring you a special bulletin."
6, 99, "Welles", "I'm speaking to you from the hickory farms in Grover's Mall, New Jersey,   through a mouthful of summer sausage, mmm, where I hardly know where to being. Mmm!  A huge spacecraft, piloted by a devastatingly handsome... Now, how, in God's name, do I know what the fellow looks like if he's inside a ship miles in the air?  It's just foolish on its face."
6, 99, "Fry", "If you want the cheese log, you'll read what I wrote."
6, 99, "Welles", "Very well. I shall comply."
6, 99, "Welles", "I'm getting reports that cities across the globe are being destroyed by this noble invader, whose good looks are apparently discernible across vast distances and through solid metal.  But wait, the leader of the attack is swaggering out of his ship and up to a convenient nearby microphone. Now why couldn't I have just described his appearance at this point? This is the type of thing I'm talking about.Lrrr"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "People of Earth, I am Lrrr, conqueror of your planet.  Cue screams.  You will now remove your skulls and play dodgeball with them for my amusement."
6, 99, "Ndnd", "Ooh! I could swear his horns have gotten longer!"
6, 99, "Kif", "Sir, I've intercepted an Earth broadcast."
6, 99, "Zapp", "Put it up on the Zenith.  Oh, God!Welles"
6, 99, "Welles", "Earth is conquered, the destruction of civilization complete. Now stay tuned for Little Orphan Annie."
6, 99, "Zapp", "To hell with Little Orphan Annie! We've got to do something."
6, 99, "Lrrr", "What's that, honey? How many dead? Uh, I don't know, 80 million? Okay. I love you, too.  That was Ndnd, she's taking me back!"
6, 99, "Welles", "I'm sorry I've been so difficult."
6, 99, "Zapp", "So, you thought you could conquer us so easily, eh? Nice job. We surrender. Earth is yours."
6, 99, "Welles", "Damn, I'm good. Now, may I please have that cheese log?"
6, 99, "Zapp", "Oh, glorious conqueror, permit me to offer up a sacrifice.  How 'bout this?"
6, 99, "Kif", "Hey!"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Yeah, he'll do.Leela"
6, 99, "Leela", "Come on, Lrrr. Show's over."
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Fine, okay. About this conquering thing.  Funny story."
6, 99, "Ndnd", "Hello, Lrrr."
6, 99, "Leela", "Lrrr! Put a stop to this right now!"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Okay, okay. Quit nagging!"
6, 99, "Ndnd", "Lrrr, why are you yelling softly with the purple-furred one?"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Uh, it's nothing, my queen."
6, 99, "Leela", "He messed up my hair."
6, 99, "Kif", "I'm missing a leg."
6, 99, "Zapp", "We fought like Hell, sir, but in the end, we caved like a house of soufflé cards."
6, 99, "Nixon", "Got it. Peace with honor. Well, I resign again."
6, 99, "Ndnd", "Come, Nixon. Introduce me to the kitchen staff. I must lay down the law about Lrrr's low sodium diet."
6, 99, "Leela", "You've got to tell her the truth. And lay off the salted peanuts!"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "I'm just trying to get the leg taste out of my mouth."
6, 99, "Ndnd", "Lrrr, I'm in here now, not out there!"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Give me a little time. With a lady like Ndnd, one must use finesse.  Coming, giangantums!"
6, 99, "Ndnd", "Mmm. That's crisp."
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Yes, but no more so than your squamous dorsal plates in the moonlight."
6, 99, "Ndnd", "I am experiencing arousal. My organs are moving into position."
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Ndnd, there's something that I've got to tell you."
6, 99, "Ndnd", "What is it? Is there someone else?Lrrr"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "What? No, no, it's about this takeover of Earth. It's... It's..."
6, 99, "Ndnd", "The spark that reignited our marriage?"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Yes! Exactly. Good night."
6, 99, "Leela", "Oh, lord! Now what?"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "I couldn't tell her the truth!Leela"
6, 99, "Leela", "Look, you scaly crybaby, you'll do what I say and do it now!"
6, 99, "Ndnd", "I knew it!"
6, 99, "Bender", "Frying pans! Cast-iron frying pans!"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "It's not what it looks like! What do I do?"
6, 99, "Leela", "Do what I say. Tell her!"
6, 99, "Ndnd", "Tell me what?  Give me the heavy one."
6, 99, "Lrrr", "The invasion was all a fake. I just wanted to impress you."
6, 99, "Ndnd", "You lied? What else have you been hiding from me?"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "What else? Nothing else."
6, 99, "Grrrl", "I still want you, Lrrr, and I'm willing to fight for you."
6, 99, "Bender", "All I've got left is a colander and a pie pan."
6, 99, "Ndnd", "Lrrr?"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Look, we only had one date. I barely mated with her."
6, 99, "Ndnd", "Whatever. I harbor no resentment against her.  What I want to know is what is up between you and Bossy Boots here."
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Her? She's just a bossy friend."
6, 99, "Ndnd", "Exactly! She nagged you, tormented you, and pushed you around. That is my job! This must be settled. I demand the ancient ritual of Rrrmrrrmrrrfrrrmrrr or Consequences!"
6, 99, "Fry", "Rrrmrrrmrrrfrrrmrrr or what?"
6, 99, "Ndnd", "Let the ritual begin. The rules are the same as in the home version. Lrrr must simply choose between myself and Leela..."
6, 99, "Leela", "Fine. Hurry up."
6, 99, "Ndnd", "By shooting the one he rejects."
6, 99, "Leela", "Lrrr, I'm getting angry. Don't you go through with this."
6, 99, "Ndnd", "She is not the boss of you! I am the boss of you!"
6, 99, "Fry", "Leela's gonna die. What would Delivery-Boy Man do? Lrrr"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "I do not want to shoot anybody."
6, 99, "Ndnd", "You never want to do anything!"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Oh, nag, nag, nag."
6, 99, "Ndnd", "You want me to stop nagging? Then shoot me!"
6, 99, "Lrrr", "Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?"
6, 99, "Ndnd", "Beats staring at your fat ass on the couch."
6, 99, "Ndnd", "Oh, yeah! Well I'll show you."
6, 99, "Fry", "Ray-blocking power!"
6, 99, "Leela", "Fry!"
6, 99, "Ndnd", "Lrrr, you were willing to shoot that bossy temptress! You really do value my nagging above all others!"
6, 99, "Leela", "Good night, dumb prince."
6, 99, "Grrrl", "Come back, Lrrr! I wanna have your Popplers! They'll never be anyone but you!  Hello."
6, 99, "Zoidberg", "Of course I'll marry you!"
6, 99, "Amy", "Wait, what the Shmell happened? I thought Ndnd disintegrated you with this ray gun."
6, 99, "Grrrl", "It's just a cheap teleporter. I bought it off the back of a comic book."
6, 99, "Farnsworth", "Cha-ching!"
6, 99, "Leela", "The teleporter gun? But that means Fry might still be...[Scene"
6, 99, "Amy", "Fry?"
6, 99, "Zoidberg", "Fry?"
6, 99, "Bender", "Is this him?"
6, 99, "Leela", "Fry, you're alive!"
6, 99, "Fry", "Not only that, I now know exactly how to end my comic book. Let's watch."
6, 99, "Invader X", "Say good-bye to your forehead, 'cause I'm gonna shoot you in it!"
6, 99, "Delivery-Boy Man", "Not if I leap in front of your death ray, and I am gonna do that. Jumping sound! Ow!"
6, 99, "Invader X", "I didn't shoot yet. As usual, your delivery arrived too soon."
6, 99, "Lane", "Oh, Delivery-Boy Man! You saved me by random chance."
6, 99, "Delivery-Boy Man", "Don't thank random chance. Thank my meteor-wishing power, with your lips."
6, 99, "Leela", "Good ending. Not great."
6, 100, "Farnsworth", "Good news, everyone. We've been hired to make our 100th delivery."
6, 100, "Zoidberg", "100!"
6, 100, "Hermes", "That's almost 10 per year."
6, 100, "Bender", "This calls for a party, baby. I'm ordering a hundred kegs, a hundred hookers, and a hundred Elvis impersonators who aren't above a little hooking, should the occasion arise!"
6, 100, "Elzar", "Be very gentle, folks. This is the soufflé you'll be delivering to Mrs. Astor."
6, 100, "Bender", "Oh my God, it's Elzar! Hi, Elzar! Great soufflé, Elzar!"
6, 100, "Elzar", "Whatever you do, don't drop it.  See, Mrs. Astor takes nitroglycerine for her heart, and being a class act, she prefers it in soufflé form.   Bam."
6, 100, "Farnsworth", "To prevent the soufflé from exploding, Bender will carry it. He's gyroscopically stable."
6, 100, "Farnsworth", "Look, Mrs. Astor's mansion, just across that rickety rope bridge."
6, 100, "Amy", "Wow, it's ricketier than it looks. You'd better try to jump it, Bender."
6, 100, "Bender", "Okay, let me back up for a running start."
6, 100, "Hobsy", "I shall inform Mrs. Astor that the circus is in town."
6, 100, "Hobsy", "Your soufflé, Madam."
6, 100, "Mrs. Astor", "I shall take it here, under my fork."
6, 100, "Zoidberg", "Where's the exploding?"
6, 100, "Hobsy", "One does not explode in Mrs. Astor's face."
6, 100, "Mrs. Astor", "I couldn't eat another bite. Hobsy?"
6, 100, "Mrs. Astor", "Well done, sir. Have you a name?"
6, 100, "Farnsworth", "Hubert Farnsworth, at your service."
6, 100, "Mrs. Astor", "A Farnsworth, you say? Well, if I'm not mistaken, the Farnsworths have been in New New York for almost two hundred years."
6, 100, "Farnsworth", "Yes, I have."
6, 100, "Fry", "And I'm his uncle!"
6, 100, "Mrs. Astor", "How charmingly unconventional."
6, 100, "Fry", "I can eat a hotdog underwater."
6, 100, "Mrs. Astor", "Say, would you Farnsworths care to be my guests tomorrow at the Astor Endowment Fundraiser? All the best families will be there."
6, 100, "Fry", "We can take 'em."
6, 100, "Mrs. Astor", "On April 10, 2912, my late husband and I set off down Fifth Avenue aboard the Land Titanic, the largest street-going vessel ever built.  Just four days into her maiden voyage, as we approached 32 Street, the line-liner struck a mailbox and went down.   2000 souls were lost that day, including my dear husband. In loving memory, I established the Mr. Astor Endowment, which this year supports the United Mutant Scholarship Fund."
6, 100, "Fry", "Mutants? That's the kind of thing you are."
6, 100, "Leela", "Shh. You know mutants aren't allowed on the surface. If anyone asks, say I'm an alien, remember?"
6, 100, "Fry", "Right. You gonna finish that roll?"
6, 100, "Leela", "Shh."
6, 100, "Mrs. Astor", "Now a short film about those pitiable creatures so in need of our charity."
6, 100, "Narrator", "Far beneath the everyday rumble of limousines and poodle feet, there toil a downtrodden people even less well off than the upper middle class.  The noble sewer mutants. For you see, generations of exposure to toxic sewage mutated them into horrific monsters!"
6, 100, "Leela", "Shut up!"
6, 100, "Narrator", "These industrious, uh, people, I guess, maintain the various pipes and poop chutes that keep decent, above-ground society functioning.  And where do these proud toileteers learn their menial skills? At Brown University, the nation's premier institution of lower learning. So please, give generously, knowing some poor helpless mutant will thank you. Not in person, thank God!"
6, 100, "Leela", "Well, that was disturbing."
6, 100, "Mrs. Astor", "Oh, I understand, dear. They are hideous."
6, 100, "Leela", "Look, I guess you mean well, but isn't that university just a tax-deductible sewer-cleaning service?"
6, 100, "Mrs. Astor", "My dear, that school is about much more than sewer pipes."
6, 100, "Leela", "Really?"
6, 100, "Mrs. Astor", "It's also about keeping those filthy things busy. There are thousands of them down there, breeding like rats."
6, 100, "Royalty girl", "My great uncle once saw a rat."
6, 100, "Mrs. Astor", "If we don't keep them busy, they'll start jabbering on about equal rights in their ill-bred manner."
6, 100, "Leela", "Let's go. If I say one more thing, I might say it with my evening boot."
6, 100, "Mrs. Astor", "Well! Rarely have I never!"
6, 100, "Fry", "Please, don't blame Leela. She's just a little ill-bred. You know how mutants are."
6, 100, "Mrs. Astor", "You companion is a mutant?"
6, 100, "Fry", "But if anyone asks, say she's an alien."
6, 100, "Mrs. Astor", "Help! Police!"
6, 100, "URL", "You may have eluded the authorities, but don't nothing get past Mrs. Astor."
6, 100, "Leela", "What's gonna happen to me?"
6, 100, "Smitty", "Permanent deportation, you mutant."
6, 100, "URL", "You going downtown, baby. Way down."
6, 100, "Raoul", "Incoming!"
6, 100, "Leela", "Thanks, Colonel."
6, 100, "Colonel", "Just doing my job, ma'am."
6, 100, "Leela", "Oh, Mom, Dad, I can't believe I have to spend the rest of my life in this hellhole.  I'm sorry."
6, 100, "Turanga Munda", "It's okay, sweetie. Now that you're here, this hellhole feels more like a nice, regular hole."
6, 100, "Turanga Morris", "What do ya say we go get some sewer coffee, sewer cake, and Safeway ice cream?"
6, 100, "Bender", "Well, the bottom's all stocked with cheap stuff. Who's in the mood to party?  Whoo!"
6, 100, "Fry", "Poor, Leela. I feel like I ruined her life."
6, 100, "Hermes", "You did ruin her life."
6, 100, "Fry", "You might be right, Hermes."
6, 100, "Hermes", "I am right."
6, 100, "Fry", "I almost feel like we should do something to help her."
6, 100, "Hermes", "We should do something!"
6, 100, "Fry", "I don't care what you say, Hermes. Let's go."
6, 100, "Fry", "Oh, mighty mayor. We're here about Turanga Leela."
6, 100, "Poopenmeyer", "You mean Leela?"
6, 100, "Fry", "Right. I mean sure, she's a mutant, we've known that for years. But we kept it a secret because she's a fine, upstanding..."
6, 100, "Poopenmeyer", "Wait. You knowingly attempted to harbor a mutant?"
6, 100, "Hermes", "We did harbor a mutant! Uh-oh."
6, 100, "Munda", "Look, Leela, there's Old Filthful."
6, 100, "Leela", "Urgh!"
6, 100, "Morris", "And there's the West Side Pipeway.  If those guys slack off for even a second, it could explode.  Hey, guys! This is my daughter, Leela."
6, 100, "Morris", "Well, they're with the chuds, now."
6, 100, "Leela", "These conditions are deplorable. I swear, I hate every single person on the surface for making us live like this."
6, 100, "Fry", "Leela!"
6, 100, "Leela", "What are you doing here?"
6, 100, "Amy", "We were sentence to two weeks in the sewer for harboring a mutant."
6, 100, "Zoidberg", "Three dollars at the drug store."
6, 100, "Fry", "I'm so sorry I ratted you out, but, you know, after two weeks down here, I'll truly understand the plight of the mutant people."
6, 100, "Leela", "How dare you? You wanna understand something? Look at that lake. One dip in that toxic muck and your DNA will be permanently mutated. You'll grow a camel hump or a Zoidberg face."
6, 100, "Zoidberg", "Urgh!"
6, 100, "Leela", "You wanna know what it's like to be a mutant? Jump in and go for a swim."
6, 100, "Fry", "I would, but I ate a bunch of potato salad, so..."
6, 100, "Leela", "Yeah, that's what I thought. You are all surface."
6, 100, "Bender", "Fry! Hermes! Where my humans are? Ah, who cares? It is on."
6, 100, "Horrible Gelatinous Blob", "Hey, hey, hey."
6, 100, "Hedonism Bot", "I trust the orgy pit has been scraped and buttered?"
6, 100, "Bender", "You know it, and there's mini-quiches, too."
6, 100, "Hermes", "It's getting cold and smelly. My odor-eaters(?) are going critical."
6, 100, "Zoidberg", "Maybe we can plotz in that giant cockle."
6, 100, "Amy", "Shmeepers, it's the Land Titanic, the biggest and onlyest land boat ever constructed..."
6, 100, "Hermes", "This was one hell of a bus."
6, 100, "Zoidberg", "Well, everyone debone a bunk and get some shut-eye."
6, 100, "Farnsworth", "Zoidberg, show some respect! This is a sacred shrine to the thousands who lost their lives."
6, 100, "Amy", "Hey, I found a safe!"
6, 100, "Farnsworth", "It's coming loose. Hand me some more of that cruise director.  The original passenger manifests."
6, 100, "Hermes", "Spreadsheets were so elegant back then."
6, 100, "Farnsworth", "Just one other item."
6, 100, "Amy", "It's jewelry. Jewelry! It's jewelry, people!"
6, 100, "Farnsworth", "It's a priceless quantum-force gemerald."
6, 100, "Zoidberg", "What's that enscribbled on it?"
6, 100, "Hermes", """My dear Mrs. Astor. My love for you is as unsinkable as this land ship and as brilliant as this stone. Dictated but not read, Mr. Astor."""
6, 100, "Amy", "Aw! That's so valuable."
6, 100, "Fry", "Yeah, I'll never have love like that. Leela hates me now.   Did you guys know I have a crush on Leela?"
6, 100, "Munda", "What's a matter, Leela? You've hardly touched your toilet clams."
6, 100, "Leela", "Maybe I was too harsh on Fry. He didn't ruin my life on purpose."
6, 100, "Morris", "Things will work out, honey. Now here, have some more of what looks like lemonade."
6, 100, "Bubblegum", "Bender, I've been to wang dang doodles all up and down the galaxy, but this is the dangest wang I ever doodled."
6, 100, "Bender", "Oh, yeah! Come on baby, let's do it.  Shake your booty, baby. Come on, yeah!  Get out! Get out! It's not fun anymore! I wanna be alone!Hedonism Bot"
6, 100, "Hedonism Bot", "Alone with me?"
6, 100, "Bender", "I said scram, grapey!"
6, 100, "[Scene", "Land Titanic. Fry is the only one still awake. He gets up and walks out of the bus.]"
6, 100, "Leela", "Fry? What are you doing."
6, 100, "Fry", "You were right. I don't know what it's like to be a mutant. But I want to know."
6, 100, "Leela", "Wait, I never meant for you to...  Oh, no!  Fry! Fry! No! No!"
6, 100, "Fry", "Any effect?"
6, 100, "Leela", "Sorry. I tried to scream but I barfed."
6, 100, "Fry", "I think I'm knowing what it's like to be a mutant."
6, 100, "Zoidberg", "So, what's with all the screaming?"
6, 100, "Fry", "Hey, guys."
6, 100, "Leela", "Fry, this is the stupidest, sweetest thing you've ever done. And you know, maybe now, together, we can be an inspiration to other mutants."
6, 100, "Fry", "I hope so, Leela."
6, 100, "Leela", "Aw. Come here. Let me give you a kiss.  Hug.  Handshake.  I'll text ya."
6, 100, "Fry", "My fellow mutants, until recently, I dwelt on the surface where a man can gaze up at the sky in wonder without a wet clump falling in his mouth."
6, 100, "Mutant", "We can do that too."
6, 100, "Leela", "Who's ready to fight for equality?  The Devolution Revolution has begun! Beautiful mutants, please welcome Devo!"
6, 100, "Mutated Mark Mothersbaugh", "Hello, Sewer City.  As long-time mutants ourselves, we support your righteous struggle and will do anything we can for you.Dwayne"
6, 100, "Dwayne", "Play ""Whip It""!"
6, 100, "Mutated Mark Mothersbaugh", "No.  Play the other one."
6, 100, "Leela", "Now that we got their attention, it's time to hit them where they sit, by bending the West Side Pipeway to return all sewage to the surface."
6, 100, "Fry", "But who could possibly bend such a huge pipe?"
6, 100, "Bender", "So lonely. Poor, sad Bender."
6, 100, "Fry", "Hey, buddy."
6, 100, "Bender", "Ah, what the heck?"
6, 100, "Mutants", "Bend it! Bend it! Bend it!"
6, 100, "Fry", "What goes down, must back up!"
6, 100, "Sal", "Yucks. I picked the wrong day to wear my new Crocses."
6, 100, "Leela", "Prepare to storm the surface for the Million Mutant March."
6, 100, "Colonel", "Move out, Fry. We need out most disgusting mutant leading the charge."
6, 100, "Fry", "I'll meet you up there. I need to check out something first."
6, 100, "Colonel", "Okay. Vyolet, you're up front."
6, 100, "Vyolet", "Hey!"
6, 100, "Mrs. Astor", "Mayor, this sewage debacle has gone on long enough. As your largest campaign contributor, I demand action!"
6, 100, "Poopenmeyer", "Very well. $80 worth of action it is."
6, 100, "Poopenmeyer", "Voilà! We simply pump the fruits of our excretion into Madison Cube Garden."
6, 100, "Mrs. Astor", "Well, it seems everything is under..."
6, 100, "Vyolet", "Two!"
6, 100, "Mutated Mark Mothersbaugh", "Four!"
6, 100, "Colonel", "Six eyes!"
6, 100, "Mutants", "The mutant people will arise."
6, 100, "Leela", "The segregation of the mutant people ends today. We demand equal rights, equal access to the surface, and the blood of your first-born children.  That so we have something to give up at the negotiations."
6, 100, "Mrs. Astor", "I've never been so moved, and I see no reason to begin now. Hobsy, flush those creatures back into the hole they crawled out of."
6, 100, "Hobsy", "Madam's sewage seeking missile."
6, 100, "Fry", "Let my people stay! [He shoots a beam of energy at the wave of sewage, parting it."
6, 100, "Bender", "Neat!"
6, 100, "Fry", "Mrs. Astor, deep in the sewers, we discovered the wreck of the Land Titanic, on which your husband land-drowned. Inside was something that might interest you."
6, 100, "Mrs. Astor", "The gemerald ring that my husband was to give me in lieu of children.  So what, I have a chandelier in my car made of those."
6, 100, "Fry", "Not the gem. This passenger manifest. It turns out there were mutants on that ship, working below deck in the sewage galley."
6, 100, "Leela's grandmother", "I was just a young girl.  Drain angels, they called us. When the ship started going down.  My mother grabbed me and made for the nearest life-car.  But the places were all taken by surface passengers. As my mother held me tight, I suddenly felt the gentle tap of a cane on my face. I turned to see the kindly smile of Mr. Astor.   Thanks to your husband's humanity, I lived to raise my own daughter, and she, a daughter in turn."
6, 100, "Leela", "Mom, why have I never heard this?"
6, 100, "Munda", "My mother's nuts."
6, 100, "Fry", "I beg you, Mrs. Astor, if you truly want to honor your husband's memory, treat these people with dignity, as he did."
6, 100, "Mrs. Astor", "Oh, he was a dear man, Mr. Astor.  Randall, let's grant these mutants their freedom."
6, 100, "Poopenmeyer", "Okay."
6, 100, "Dwayne", "Are we not men now?"
6, 100, "Mutated Mark Mothersbaugh", "I'm forty percent potato, but close enough."
6, 100, "Leela", "Thank you, Fry. I think maybe I can stomach that kiss now."
6, 100, "Fry", "What the...?"
6, 100, "Mr. Astor", "Good afternoon. I am Mr. Astor. I did not perish that fateful day, but rather plummeted into the toxic lake, where I mutated and lived in solitude until this ruddy lad here stepped into my mouth and lodged there."
6, 100, "Mrs. Astor", "Mister? Is that really you?"
6, 100, "Zoidberg", "Horray! A happy ending for the rich people!"
6, 100, "Leela", "Mom, Dad, Grandma, this is where I work."
6, 100, "Munda", "Oh! Was there a fire?"
6, 100, "Amy", "So, Bender, how was the party?"
6, 100, "Bender", "Only the greatest party ever! I don't need to have another party in my whole life. I am partied out!"
6, 100, "Fry", "Dang! Sorry we missed it!"
6, 100, "Bender", "We could have another one, if it would make you guys feel better."
6, 100, "Fry", "Really? No, that's not necessary."
6, 100, "Bender", "Hit it, Bender!"
6, 101, "Transition Announcer", "It's ""The Futurama Holiday Spectacular""! Brought to you by..."
6, 101, "Transition Announcer", "Gunderson's Unshelled Nuts!"
6, 101, "Amy", "Ah, the Xmas season. Who wants a delicious unshelled nut?"
6, 101, "Bender", "Ooh, I'll have one!"
6, 101, "Amy", "Mmm... ""It's NUTSO Good!"""
6, 101, "Fry", "Oh."
6, 101, "Leela", "What's wrong, Fry? Are you regretting another wasted year?"
6, 101, "Fry", "I don't know. Somethin' about Xmas just doesn't feel like Christmas."
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "Santa's coming! Initiate defenses!"
6, 101, "Robot Santa", "God rest ye, merry gentlemen... in peace!"
6, 101, "Fry", "Can someone please explain how you celebrate this crazy holiday? Preferably in song?"
6, 101, "Robot Santa", "It's the violentest season of the year."
6, 101, "Elf", "Old Kringle-bot has come to spread some mugs of Xmas fear."
6, 101, "Robot Santa", "Sugar-plummy visions will be dancing in your headWhen I cane you from the comfort of my sled."
6, 101, "Leela", "On Xmas Eve, we don our gay apparel,Kevlar vests, asbestos stockings and a barrel."
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "And if Grandma's Xmas fruitcake finally reaches critical mass,It can be regifted straight to Santa's ass."
6, 101, "Robot Santa", "But the ornamental armaments are merely superficial,The tinsel and the trappings are just icing on the missile.The one thing that you need to make your Xmas day splendiferousIs a pine tree; a pine tree that's coniferous."
6, 101, "Planet Express crew (except Amy)", "We have to have a pine tree as coniferous."
6, 101, "Robot Santa", "You're welcome."
6, 101, "Fry", "You know, Santa may have killed Scruffy, but he makes a good point. What we need is an old-fashioned pine tree."
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "Cram it, Virginia! Pine trees have been extinct for over eight hundred years."
6, 101, "Leela", "Professor, maybe there's some way to bring the pine trees back to life, like we did with the barking snakes."
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "Pine trees aren't barking snakes. They won't just turn up in a salad at Olive Garden. But there is one hope, and, as usual, it's Norwegian!"
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "Behold! The Svalbard Global Seed Vault! Since 2008, the vault has preserved seeds of every known plant species in case of extinction."
6, 101, "Hermes", "And I brought a few seeds of my own."
6, 101, "Norwegian seed guard", "Halt! Wh-what's your business poky-pokin' about da seed vault, eh, guardian of mankind's precious botanical heritage dere?"
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "We just wanna come in and rummage about a bit."
6, 101, "Norwegian seed guard", "Oh. So... okay."
6, 101, "Bender", "Yo, ABBA, what's that next door?Norwegian seed guard"
6, 101, "Norwegian seed guard", "Oh, dat's da germ warfare repository."
6, 101, "Leela", "It's so close! Is there any chance of cross-contamination?"
6, 101, "Norwegian seed guard", "No."
6, 101, "Norwegian seed guard", "Now, your pine trees were all chopped down to make imirgincee toilet paper durin' th' fifty-year squirts. Lucky da seeds have bin preserved here in da vault der."
6, 101, "Amy", "What's that splork on them?  It's not germs, is it?"
6, 101, "Norwegian seed guard", "No."
6, 101, "Fry", "Now that's a tree worth chopping down."
6, 101, "Tinny Tim", "Indeed. 'Tis a loverly tree. 'Twould truly be my finest Xmas eve-"
6, 101, "Nixon", "Araroo!"
6, 101, "Nixon", "That's what my poll numbers need"
6, 101, "Cheney", "As your Vice President, I order you to steal that tree."
6, 101, "Nixon", "My fellow Earthicans, welcome to the Annual White House Xmas Tree Lighting, brought to you by Gunderson's Nuts!"
6, 101, "Amy", "Oh, no! Could the seed have been contaminated by a virus from the germ vault?"
6, 101, "Norwegian seed guard", "Oh, yeh, I suppose."
6, 101, "Leela", "Wait, this could be a good thing. That weaponized virus made the sickly little tree grow big and strong."
6, 101, "Leela", "Wait, this could be a good thing. Reforestation has begun."
6, 101, "Bender", "Aw, jeez with this, hey?(?)"
6, 101, "Leela", "Arguably, this could be a good thing. The planet has returned to its primeval state."
6, 101, "Fry", "Earth is just the way it was before the white man came!"
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "Good news! All these pine trees are fighting global warming by producing oxygen. Happy now, Gore?"
6, 101, "Gore", "Yeah, but I'd be happier if I had a set of lungs."
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "Wait a second! Oxygen levels are rising too rapidly! 10%... 20% ...60%!"
6, 101, "Gore", "As long as it doesn't hit 70!"
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "80%!"
6, 101, "Bender", "Y'know, I don't recall having done anything for a while. But I still feel like I deserve a smoke.  Hey, cool, the air's on fire."
6, 101, "Robot Santa", "Ho ho ho! Everyone's dead!  Stay tuned for another tale of holiday hilarity!"
6, 101, "Transition Announcer", "Now, back to..."
6, 101, "Transition Announcer", "...the Gunderson's Nuts Holiday Spectacular featuring Futurama!"
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "Okay, crew. Xmas break is over. It's time to destroy these gifts we forgot to deliver."
6, 101, "Bender", "Woah, woah, woah! How come we get off for every dumb human holiday but not for robot holidays?"
6, 101, "Leela", "Oh, Lord, not Robanukah."
6, 101, "Bender", "I'm talkin' about Robanukah, the holiest six and a half weeks in the robot calendar!"
6, 101, "Amy", "Pfft! That's just a fake holiday you make up every year to get out of work."
6, 101, "Fry", "Yeah, if it's real, how come there's no song that explains how you celebrate it?"
6, 101, "Bender", "Because there is! Hit it!"
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "Hit what?"
6, 101, "Bender", "I've placed instruments under your seats. Play 'em or I'll break 'em over your heads!"
6, 101, "Bender", "Robanukah may sound as if it's Jewish,But its ancient sounding customs are exceptionally newish.So take a hearty swallow from your robo-kiddish cup,Which will give me time to quickly make them up."
6, 101, "Hermes", "Do you spin a dreidel made from clay?"
6, 101, "Bender", "Mine is called a droidel and it's rigged to make you pay."
6, 101, "Amy", "Do you eat these dummy tin-wrapped chocolate coins?"
6, 101, "Bender", "Better!  We got fembots with illegal five-speed groins!  Shalom, Ruth and Esther!"
6, 101, "Ruth", "Why with the music so loud?"
6, 101, "Esther", "Would it kill him to turn up the heat a little in here?"
6, 101, "Bender", "But by far the most important thing is oil."
6, 101, "Leela", "To keep the lamp light burning or to help the latkes broil?"
6, 101, "Bender", "No, we pour the holy lubricant out from the sacred vesselInto this blessed pit so they can wrestle."
6, 101, "Planet Express crew", "The extra made-up touch that makes Robanukah so specialIs the oil in which the nasty fembots wrestle."
6, 101, "Bender", "We shall now begin the traditional oil wrestling. Will the referee bring out the ceremonial crudes of petroleum oil?  Thank you, Abraham."
6, 101, "Ruth", "Not in the hair, please. I just had it did."
6, 101, "Bender", "Aw, no! These broads are s'posed to wrestle for six and a half weeks! But there's only enough petroleum oil for four and a half weeks!"
6, 101, "Esther", "We're still gettin' paid, right?"
6, 101, "Bender", "I told you it's an audition!"
6, 101, "Leela", "Bender, four and a half weeks of oil wrestling sounds like plenty."
6, 101, "Bender", "This isn't a lousy reform Robanukah! We need more petroleum oil!"
6, 101, "Hoschel", "I got me some whale oil, some squirrel oil—"
6, 101, "Bender", "Not kosher! It has to be petroleum oil! Do you not give a damn about the hallowed traditions of Robanukah?!"
6, 101, "Hoschel", "I reckon I do not. Anyways, Earth done run out of petroleum oil."
6, 101, "Gore", "I tried to warn you.  One unit of free limitless solar power please."
6, 101, "Hoschel", "That'll be... I dunno... ten bucks?"
6, 101, "Gore", "Um, can you make change for a Nobel Prize?"
6, 101, "Bender", "Aw, man! Can't we just make more petroleum oil?"
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "I'm afraid not, son.  Petroleum only forms when organic matter is subjected to intense pressure for hundreds of millions of years."
6, 101, "Fry", "I can't wait that long! I've got ADD!"
6, 101, "Bender", "This is so unfair!"
6, 101, "Ruth", "I don't wrestle dry, Bender. I went to Vassar."
6, 101, "Bender", "Professor, I want you to look these poor floozies in the eye and tell them their oil wrestling days are over."
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "I suppose there could be a minute quantity of petroleum left. But it would be insanely deep within the Earth, at pressures so dangerously high that—"
6, 101, "Bender", "Let's go already!"
6, 101, "Leela", "Setting Bachman turners to overdrive."
6, 101, "Hermes", "We're getting pretty deep.  Look! Mole coffins!"
6, 101, "Amy [Off Screen]", "Oh, no! We tunneled into a tunnel!"
6, 101, "Zoidberg", "What's that loud, boring sound you'll hear when I stop talking?"
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "It's an albino humping worm!"
6, 101, "Fry", "Why do they call it that?"
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "Because it doesn't have any pigment."
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "What's our depth, Captain?"
6, 101, "Leela", "Forty kilometers. Fifty!"
6, 101, "Bender", "There must be petroleum oil down here somewhere. Go deeper! Deeper!"
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "No, Bender! The ship can't withstand this much pressure! Sometimes it falls apart just sitting in the hangar!"
6, 101, "Bender", "Professor, I've never asked for anything before, but seeing those fembots glistening with oil means more to me than life itself."
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "Oh, call me an old fool, but I believe the Lord is speaking through you.  Brace yourselves, everyone!"
6, 101, "Leela", "One hundred kilometers! Two hundred!"
6, 101, "Amy", "I hate to complain about the heat, but the air conditioner is on fire!"
6, 101, "Hermes", "My ice cream manwich!"
6, 101, "Leela", "What the hell are we doing? We're all gonna die so this ""junkyard Golem"" can celebrate Robanukah."
6, 101, "Bender", "You vile racist! Haven't my people suffered enough? Now keep drilling for that petroleum oil, you selfish cowards! Although, then again, I guess any kind of oil would be just as-"
6, 101, "Everybody else", "Aah!"
6, 101, "Bender", "Not my fault."
6, 101, "Bender", "I am so great! Bender is great! Bender, Bender, Bender--  Man, where'd the time go?  Hey, you guys wanna— Oh. Right.  They turned into petroleum oil! I thought they were selfish, yet in the end it turned out it was I who thought they were selfish!"
6, 101, "Bender", "Doo, doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo, doo, doo-Doo, DOO!"
6, 101, "Bender", "Hey, ladies, I found some... What the—?  There was only enough petroleum for four and a half weeks of oil wrestling. But it lasted 500 million years! It's a miracle!"
6, 101, "Bender", "Happy Robanukah, everyone! Coming up next, more thoughtful, interfaith hijinx!"
6, 101, "Transition Announcer", "And now, the unrelated conclusion."
6, 101, "Leela", "LaBarbara, Hermes, happy Kwanzaa. We brought a chocolate cake. But now I'm worried that might be offensive in some way."
6, 101, "LaBarbara", "Just sit down.Bubblegum"
6, 101, "Bubblegum", "Happy Kwanzaa, brother men and sister men."
6, 101, "Hermes", "Well, look at the cat the cat dragged in."
6, 101, "Bubblegum", "Kwanzaa tradition encourages educational gifts. So I brought Dwight my book on Mathketball."
6, 101, "Dwight", "Woah! Let me see that."
6, 101, "Bubblegum", "I'll sign it for you later."
6, 101, "Barbados", "Mon, it's a cold one out there."
6, 101, "Hermes", "Barbados Slim?"
6, 101, "LaBarbara", "Come in, Barbados. Look at yourself, all throbbing and shirtless for the holiday. I hope you're ready to celebrate."
6, 101, "Barbados", "All night long, woman."
6, 101, "Hermes", "I'm glad you all could be here with my family. Kwanzaa traditions are quite ancient, dating back over 1,000 years."
6, 101, "Fry", "Woah!"
6, 101, "Zoidberg", "If only someone could tell us more about these traditions."
6, 101, "Kwanzaa-bot", "Oh, yeah!"
6, 101, "Dwight", "Hey, Kool-Aid's here."
6, 101, "LaBarbara", "No, child. That's not a made-up character. It's Kwanzaa-bot."
6, 101, "Kwanzaa-bot", "And I'm gonna tell you all how we celebrate Kwanzaa. Zoidberg, lay down a beat."
6, 101, "Zoidberg", "How about I just lay down?"
6, 101, "Kwanzaa-bot", "The seven basic principles that go to make up Kwanzaa!"
6, 101, "LaBarbara", "Kujichagulia..."
6, 101, "Barbados and Bubblegum", "And umoja..."
6, 101, "Hermes", "And the rest."
6, 101, "Planet Express crew", "Now we get it!"
6, 101, "Kwanzaa-bot", "Sit back down! There's gonna be a test."
6, 101, "Bubblegum", "Cooperative economics."
6, 101, "Kwanzaa-bot", "Yo, boondocks, I'm talkin' here! Put away the comics!"
6, 101, "Barbados", "Like the ever-changing nature of my sexual proclivities."
6, 101, "Kwanzaa-bot", "I think there's one called ""nia,"" but I don't speak Swahili,"
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "That's from Xmas and Robanakuh, you plagiarizing lout!"
6, 101, "Kwanzaa-bot", "Yeah, I'm kinda losin' interest here. I'd best be rollin' out."
6, 101, "Dwight", "What's that, Black Santa?"
6, 101, "Kwanzaa-bot", "You need seven Kwanzaa candles that you light up every night."
6, 101, "Planet Express crew", "They must be made of beeswax or we might as well be white."
6, 101, "LaBarbara", "Well, we got no beeswax candles, but these scented regular wax candles will do just fine."
6, 101, "Kwanzaa-bot", "Girl, those stink sticks are for single women who take baths. If your Kwanzaa candles ain't 100% beeswax, you bring shame on your people."
6, 101, "LaBarbara", "Well, now that won't do. Husband, show a little ku'umba and fetch some beeswax before Kwanzaa ends."
6, 101, "Hermes", "Sweet candelabra of La Habra, LaBarbara! Isn't this the last night of Kwanzaa?"
6, 101, "Kwanzaa-bot", "Who the hell knows?"
6, 101, "Hermes", "Finally, a bee farm that's open late on Kwanzaa. Madam, I need beeswax."
6, 101, "Petunia", "You sure you don't need a little honey, handsome? Maybe a taste of sweet nectar straight from the hive?"
6, 101, "Hermes", "I just need some beeswax to make Kwanzaa candles."
6, 101, "Petunia", "Well, that's too darn bad. There ain't no beeswax in the whole world."
6, 101, "Amy", "Oh, no! This could be the year without a Kwanzaa, like every year before 1966."
6, 101, "Petunia", "The bees are acting all crazy"
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "My God! It's Colony Collapse Syndrome. The bees are swarming with parasites. They're all dying."
6, 101, "Petunia", "Yeah, but what a way to go. ""Die young and leave a pretty corpse,"" that's what I say."
6, 101, "Bender", "You should say someth'n' else."
6, 101, "Fry", "Wait. I know where we can get beeswax. From those giant space bees that nearly killed us, and we swore we'd never go back there."
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "Let's go back there!"
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "To communicate with the bees, we'll need to use these trans-bumbalators. Bender, say something in bee talk."
6, 101, "Leela", "I'm sorry, Bender. What do you want me to put on the glass?  Okay, if we survive."
6, 101, "Amy", "Something's wrong. It's way too quiet."
6, 101, "Fry", "Like the deadly Prius."
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "Ah, here they come."
6, 101, "Leela", "They're in attack formation. They're going to kill us!  That was weird. It's like the Jägermeister air show all over again."
6, 101, "Hermes", "According to Google Hive, we're at the exact center of the honeycomb. Oh! And there's a Jamba Juice point 2 miles that way."
6, 101, "Bender", "Does that thing tell you where the Queen Bee is? The big, fat, ugly, compound-eyed, hairy-thoraxed..."
6, 101, "Queen", "Don't be applying your Eurocentric standards of beauty to me, fool."
6, 101, "Hermes", "What's with the kamikaz-bees?"
6, 101, "Queen", "Man, my hive's been going buck-wild since these blood-ganking butt crabs moved in."
6, 101, "Zoidberg", "Been there, done that."
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "They're all infected, just like the bees on Earth."
6, 101, "Queen", "Brother-sucking parasites gone and disrupted our hivemind. Now, instead of working in harmony, my bees just talk smack to each other."
6, 101, "Bee #1", "Are you all black with yellow stripes or yellow with black stripes?"
6, 101, "Bee #2", "Yellow with black stripes, man."
6, 101, "Bee #1", "Why don't you just move along?"
6, 101, "Bee #3", "Let me ask you something, you sting my wife?"
6, 101, "Bee #4", "What kind of buzzing question is that? Where do you get the wings big enough to ask me that?"
6, 101, "Leela", "Okay, gang. We have plenty of beeswax. Let's get back to the ship."
6, 101, "Hermes", "No, we're not going anywhere. I can't abide all this bee-on-bee conflict. It's time to African-Americanize these honeybees. Listen up, bees. It's Kwanzaa, a time of Umoja."
6, 101, "Amy", "It means unity."
6, 101, "Hermes", "You have to learn to work together again."
6, 101, "Queen", "The crazy tablecloth-man is right. It's time to set aside our differences."
6, 101, "Bee #1", "Black stripe, yellow stripe. At the end o' day, we're just a couple of darn talking space bees."
6, 101, "Bee #3", "Hey, forget about it. Come here and give me a sting."
6, 101, "Farnsworth", "Look, the spirit of Kwanzaa is killing the parasites."
6, 101, "Fry", "Yuck, but yay!"
6, 101, "Queen", "Thank you, my human brother. Your message of unity has touched our souls. We are once again of a single hive-mind."
6, 101, "Kwanzaa-bot", "Oh, yeah."
6, 101, "Zoidberg", "Hurray! Kwanzaa-bot's here to save—  Aw, they killed him."
6, 101, "Hermes", "Joyous Kwanzaa, everybody."
6, 101, "Gore", "Don't worry, the Futurama crew will be back next year, with all-new episodes featuring Bender, Leela and me, Al Gore, as Captain Lance Starman.  And from all of us here at Gunderson's Nuts, happy holidays."
6, 102, "Professor Farnsworth", "Who likes good news?  Everyone.  Then good news, everyone! Our next delivery isn't to some dangerous, outer-space planet. It's to Earth!"
6, 102, "Fry", "Earth is dangerous. I fell off my chair there once.  Ow! Quit it, Earth."
6, 102, "Leela", "We won't even have to leave New New York! The package is going to Long Long Island."
6, 102, "Professor Farnsworth", "Yes, to the lavish Mafia-style villa of the Donbot."
6, 102, "Bender", "The Donbot?!  The vicious Robot gangster?!  I'd better use my special Robot vision to see what's inside.  It looks like a pair of clamps!"
6, 102, "Clamps", "When are those new clamps gonna get here?  These are all rusted-out with snitch juice!"
6, 102, "Donbot", "Patience, Clamps.  It is my eldest daughter's wedding day.  You don't want the Space Pope to see a clampin' now, do ya?"
6, 102, "Clamps", "Aw, jeez. I forgot my Pope manners."
6, 102, "Space Pope", "Dearly beloved,  it is with great speed that I now pronounce you husband and wife."
6, 102, "Donbot", "What the—"
6, 102, "Joey Mousepad", "May I help you with some assistance?"
6, 102, "Leela", "Delivery for...  Francis X. Clampazzo?"
6, 102, "Joey Mousepad", "We don't got nobody here by that alias."
6, 102, "Clamps", "Hey! Hey! That's me.  Are those my new clamps?"
6, 102, "Joey Mousepad", "Your name's Francis?"
6, 102, "Bender", "Guys, look. It's Calculon. And the Robot Devil!  And an open bar!  What's not to sneak into?"
6, 102, "Leela", "Bender, you can't crash a mob wedding."
6, 102, "Bender", "You forget, Leela, I'm Bender, owner of disguise."
6, 102, "Space Pope", "And now, ladies and gentlemen, my good friend... Calculon!"
6, 102, "Calculon", "Hey, this one's for the new couple.  It's your day. It's all about you.  Who's that singing at your wedding? It's Calculon!  Calculon!  Calculon!"
6, 102, "Bender", "Ay! Oh! Piscopo!  This guy!  Bada-boing!  Hey, sexy. I'm Bender. What brings you to this tacky soirée?"
6, 102, "Donbot's eldest daughter", "I'm the bride!"
6, 102, "Bender", "Oops.  How 'bout you, baby? Wanna do it?"
6, 102, "Fanny", "Bender, it's me, Fanny!"
6, 102, "Bender", "You who?"
6, 102, "Fanny", "The Donbot's wife? We had an affair?"
6, 102, "Bender", "An affair, huh? Sounds like me.   Jeez, I'd better be a little more careful. I don't wanna hit on anybody I already had sex with."
6, 102, "Fanny", "Hiya, Bella!"
6, 102, "Bella", "Hi, Mom!"
6, 102, "Bender", "What about you? You're my third choice."
6, 102, "Bella", "Oh, Bender! This is all happening too slowly. Let's get married!"
6, 102, "Bender", "Quiet! I'm makin' out with a floozy!  Hold your clapper. Someone's comin'!"
6, 102, "Calculon", "Donbot, please. I'll pay you back as soon as you lend me some more money."
6, 102, "Donbot", "Sorry, Calculon. It gives me no joy to do this... Because Clamps will be doin' it.  Clamps, here are your new clamps."
6, 102, "Clamps", "Clamps!"
6, 102, "Calculon", "No. No!  Line?   No!"
6, 102, "Bella", "Yeah, Daddy hates welchers. The only thing he hates worse is witnesses...   And guys who mess around with his daughters..."
6, 102, "Bella", "And attempt to duplicate his meatball recipe."
6, 102, "Leela", "How was the wedding, Bender?"
6, 102, "Bender", "Says who?!  I didn't witness anything!"
6, 102, "Morbo", "In entertainment news, two-time Oscar-pool winner Calculon was brutally clamped yesterday by an unknown assailant."
6, 102, "Amy", "Poor Calculon."
6, 102, "Bender", "Alright, Amy, you win!  The mob did it. I saw the whole thing while also having hot sex with the Donbot's daughter.  I'm scared and great at sex!"
6, 102, "Leela", "Bender, you need to go to the police and tell them a tastefully edited version of what you just said."
6, 102, "Bender", "What, and have the Mafia come after me too?!  No way!  This secret goes to my grave!"
6, 102, "Male voice", "The Bureau is offering anyone with information about this gangland-style clamping a fifty-dollar reward."
6, 102, "Bender", "Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! And— And then Calculon said, ""No. No!"""
6, 102, "Bender", """No!""  And, then, I ate some excellent meatballs.  Can I have my fifty bucks now?"
6, 102, "Robot Stack", "I enjoyed your story.  Especially the tasteful love scene.  But it's not enough to convict the Donbot. You'll have to testify... In open court."
6, 102, "Bender", "No. No! Can I have another fifty dollars?"
6, 102, "Robot Stack", "No."
6, 102, "Bender", "No?"
6, 102, "Robot Stack", "No!"
6, 102, "Bender", "No!"
6, 102, "Bailiff", "All rise for the honourable Judge 723."
6, 102, "Judge 723", "Be seated. Organised crime is a plague on our society and I will not tolerate any form of intimidation during—"
6, 102, "Bailiff", "All rise for the honourable Judge 724."
6, 102, "Judge 724", "Good day. I'd like to say I'm prepared to tolerate several, if not all, forms of intimidation during this trial. Prosecutor?"
6, 102, "Hyper-Chicken", "Your Honour, the prosecution pecks for a mistrial on the grounds of jury tamperin'!"
6, 102, "Judge 724", "Donbot?"
6, 102, "Donbot", "Motion denied."
6, 102, "Judge 724", "Prosecutor, call your first witness."
6, 102, "Hyper-Chicken", "The people call our star witness Mr. X, whose appearance will be altered because he's in grave danger."
6, 102, "Bella", "Bender, I've been looking for you! Which cake do you like better for our wedding?!"
6, 102, "Donbot", "Bender?"
6, 102, "Bender", "Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it!  That was close."
6, 102, "Yellow and red manbot", "Isn't it true, Mr. X, that you were slandering this innocent Mafioso to distract from your own felonious past?  Including the crime you made up yourself called burglarcenarsony?"
6, 102, "Bender", "That's a wholly-owned trademark of Rodríguez Crime Concepts Inc.! Besides, I'm not on trial here!"
6, 102, "Judge 724", "That's true.  You're on trial in courtroom three."
6, 102, "Judge 802", "You are charged with two counts of burglarcenarsony. How do you plead?"
6, 102, "Bender", "Not inno-guilty-cent!"
6, 102, "Bender", "And then the Donbot said, ""Sorry, Calculon."""
6, 102, "Bender", "And then Calculon said,  ""No!"""
6, 102, "Donbot", "I think we've heard enough."
6, 102, "Bender", "Wait, I'm not finished. Oh!  Now I'm finished."
6, 102, "Hyper-Chicken", "Your Honour, the prosecution roosts."
6, 102, "Judge 724", "Have you reached a verdict?"
6, 102, "Hedonism Bot", "Indeed. After a steamy twelve-way deliberation, we find the accused guilty as—"
6, 102, "Calculon", "Wait!  The Donbot is innocent!"
6, 102, "Judge 724", "Calculon, who is that escorting you?"
6, 102, "Hedonism Bot", "Yes. Who?"
6, 102, "Calculon", "My personal trainer.  And he's trained me to say that my wounds were self-inflicted.  For, you see,  I'm a big Hollywood idiot dumb guy what does that sorta thing."
6, 102, "Joey Mousepad", "Perfect."
6, 102, "Hedonism Bot", "We find the Donbot..."
6, 102, "Calculon", "Dramatic pause..."
6, 102, "Hedonism Bot", "Not guilty!"
6, 102, "Amy", "What?"
6, 102, "Donbot", "Honey, if you're marryin' Bender, ya might wanna get a black dress for the wedding."
6, 102, "Bella", "That's gonna look hot!"
6, 102, "Robot Stack", "Don't be scared, Bender. We're putting you in the witness relocation programme.  You'll be given a new identity, a new place to live, and this iPod.  I don't want it anymore."
6, 102, "Bender", "So I gotta hide forever?!"
6, 102, "Robot Stack", "No. Just until the Robot Mafia finds and kills you.  They're pretty good at that."
6, 102, "Bender", "Goodbye, Professor.  Before I leave, I just want you to know I've never done any work whatsoever.  Zoidberg, I know it seems like I can't stand you.  Leela, you'll have to watch out for Fry now."
6, 102, "Leela", "Oh, Lord."
6, 102, "Fry", "I wish I could go with you, pal."
6, 102, "Bender", "Me too. I'll need a butler."
6, 102, "Robot Stack", "Bender, we have to go."
6, 102, "Professor Farnsworth", "There'll never be another like him.   Let's hire someone better!"
6, 102, "Donbot", "Clamps.  Clamps!"
6, 102, "Clamps", "Huh?"
6, 102, "Donbot", "Listen to my boss words. I would like you to apply for Bender's old job and cosy up to this Fry, his best friend."
6, 102, "Clamps", "Yeah. And I'll introduce 'im to my best friend.   Clamp number one!   Sorry, toots."
6, 102, "Donbot", "No, Clamps. No clamps. Sooner or later, Bender will contact Fry... As relocated squealers always do."
6, 102, "Joey Mousepad", "Then with the clamps... Francis."
6, 102, "Clamps", "Francis? Francis?!  I'll clamp you with the Francis!"
6, 102, "Joey Mousepad", "Ay! Oh! Take it ease."
6, 102, "Clamps", "Hey there, Slick. I'm 'ere about the job."
6, 102, "Hermes", "Take a seat.  We'll begin the interview shortly."
6, 102, "Hermes", "We'll start with Andrew."
6, 102, "Clamps", "Yeah, they all kinda broke. So... When do I start?"
6, 102, "Hermes", "Everyone, this is Francis."
6, 102, "Fry", "Hey, Francis."
6, 102, "Professor Farnsworth", "Hello, Francis."
6, 102, "Leela", "Hello."
6, 102, "Amy", "Cute name."
6, 102, "Hermes", "Look what he can do."
6, 102, "Clamps", "Yeah, I do it all. Clampin', crimpin', occasional snippin'."
6, 102, "Professor Farnsworth", "Snipping?  Looks like you may be out of a job, Zoidberg."
6, 102, "Zoidberg", "That's all good fun. But, of course, a clamp is no substitute for the precision of a genuine—"
6, 102, "Amy", "Francis, would you do the honours?"
6, 102, "Zoidberg", "Stay off my turf!"
6, 102, "Clamps", "Eesh.  That guy can bite my shiny metal clamps."
6, 102, "Fry", "You remind me of my old friend Bender."
6, 102, "Clamps", "Oh, yeah? Where does he safely live?"
6, 102, "Fry", "I dunno. Hey, you wanna come to my house and play?"
6, 102, "Clamps", "Yeah. Sounds like freakin' fun."
6, 102, "Clamps", "Four stinkin' years of clampin' school for this?"
6, 102, "Zoidberg", "Greetings, Francis.  Sorry if I was a little hostile before, but snipping is the only reason I'm even tolerated around here. Not like you, with those magnificent squeezers!"
6, 102, "Clamps", "Squeezers? Squeezers?!  They're clamps, you !  And if I wanna -in' snip with these clamps, I will snip with these -ing clamps!  Why do you think they call me—  Francis?"
6, 102, "Professor Farnsworth", "Eh, Francis, I have good news. It's time for your first delivery...  To the Moon!"
6, 102, "Clamps", "Fan--in'-tastic!"
6, 102, "Fry", "Here's the two-hundred feet of rope you ordered, Sheriff Burley."
6, 102, "Sheriff Burley", "Hot diggety! You fellas wanna stick around for the hangin' tomorrow? It's gonna be a doozy.  I sure do love hangin' people.  Well, best start cuttin' the nooses."
6, 102, "Leela", "Oh! You know who could help with that?!  Francis!"
6, 102, "Leela", "Nice job, Francis! I liked how you didn't get drunk and steal anyone's organs. Like our old Robot—"
6, 102, "Fry", "Bender?!  Bender! It's me, Fry!"
6, 102, "Donbot", "I knew Bender would turn up purely by coincidence. Take care of 'im, but do it quietly."
6, 102, "Clamps", "Don't worry. We're in space. Where no one can hear you clamp!"
6, 102, "Hermes", "What do you know? The Feds gave Bender a new identity as a Moon farmer."
6, 102, "Fry", "Well, he must be afraid to break character in case there's any Robot Mafia scuzzballs around."
6, 102, "Clamps", "Huh?"
6, 102, "Amy", "Come on! Let's go check on 'im!"
6, 102, "Clamps", "I checked on a guy once.  I checked 'im into tiny pieces!"
6, 102, "Hydroponic farmer", "Bender?! Nope, don't recollect nobody by that name. But let me ask my son-in-law.   Billy!"
6, 102, "Bender", "Yes, Moon pa?"
6, 102, "Hydroponic farmer", "These nice, big-city hillbillies are lookin' for someone named Bender. You know 'im?"
6, 102, "Bender", "No, he ain't any of the eight people I ever met."
6, 102, "Fry", "Bender, it's us, your friends. You can drop the hillbilling moron act."
6, 102, "Bender", "Sorry, mister, but I'm no Bender. I'm just a simple farmer. Name's Billy West!"
6, 102, "Fry", "Billy West. What a stupid, phony, made-up name!"
6, 102, "Hydroponic farmer", "You city folk are probably hungry from premarital sex and flag burnin'. Y'all wanna stay for supper?"
6, 102, "Amy", "Well...  My boyfriend and I were gonna have sex on a burning flag, but...  I could have a bite."
6, 102, "Billy West", "May I present my beautiful Robot wife, the Crushinator. She's servin' up the dinner and the charm."
6, 102, "Crushinator", "Mashed chicken, Mr. Fry?"
6, 102, "Fry", "Sure!"
6, 102, "Clamps", "So, uh... Billy... Where were you born?"
6, 102, "Billy West", "Right here in Moon country!"
6, 102, "Professor Farnsworth", "And how long have you been a farmer?"
6, 102, "Billy West", "Reckon I was born a farmer. Folks say my momma was a hoe."
6, 102, "Leela", "Oh, dear! I seem to have warped my fork!  Could you bend it back for me? Billy?"
6, 102, "Billy West", "Bend it?  I can't even lift it. Which is weird... Seein' as how my daddy was a forklift."
6, 102, "Leela", "Wow! Bender is really committed to his new Jethrovian identity!"
6, 102, "Billy West", "If y'all are all finished, I'll drive y'all back to town in the old clunker."
6, 102, "Billy West", "So... Y'all flew here in a spacey-ship?"
6, 102, "Hermes", "Stop talking like that! You live on the Moon!"
6, 102, "Fry", "If that is Bender, I guess he's just happier in his new life."
6, 102, "Professor Farnsworth", "I refuse to believe anyone is happy! Mr. West, would you mind if I examined your brain?"
6, 102, "Billy West", "Examine? Heck. If you can find it, you can keep it."
6, 102, "Professor Farnsworth", "Gadzooks!  Bender's hard drive no longer contains any of his old memories. When the Feds bumpkinised him, they completely wiped out his old identity!"
6, 102, "Billy West", "Well, I don't know about that. But who am I to argue with a man from the sky!  So long, space heroes!"
6, 102, "Fry", "You sure you don't wanna kill all Humans?"
6, 102, "Billy West", "Pfff! I love all Humans!"
6, 102, "Fry", "He really is gone."
6, 102, "Fry", "I guess I'm happy for 'im. And, honestly, Francis is a way better friend than Bender ever was.  Hey, where is Francis?"
6, 102, "Billy West", "One sasparoil, Sheriff! I'm thirsty!"
6, 102, "Sheriff Burley", "Make it two. I'm greedy."
6, 102, "Clamps", "You got the rest fooled.  But not me.  Now let's take this outside so's no one else gets clamped."
6, 102, "Billy West", "You're the boss, stranger!"
6, 102, "Clamps", "I'm gonna clamp your body parts off one by one. But, then, I'm gonna clamp your wounds shut so ya stay alive... While I clamp ya some more. Say your prayers, stoolie."
6, 102, "Billy West", "Okay!  God bless grandma and grandpa—"
6, 102, "Clamps", "They're next! Right now, I'm gonna cut your damn head off!"
6, 102, "Zoidberg", "Drop the Robut.  I thought I told you. I do the cutting around here."
6, 102, "Clamps", "Scuttle on home.  This ain't none of your business, Slick."
6, 102, "Zoidberg", "My name isn't Slick. It's Zoidberg.   John -ing Zoidberg!"
6, 102, "Fry", "Stop, Zoidberg!  You'll hurt Francis!"
6, 102, "Clamps", "Oh, yeah? Take this! That that!"
6, 102, "Zoidberg", "Oy!"
6, 102, "Clamps", "Why, you lousy—  I'm gonna clamp ya!"
6, 102, "Zoidberg", "Oy!  Ow. Ow. Ow."
6, 102, "Clamps", "Looks like an all-you-can-kill lobster fest."
6, 102, "Zoidberg", "That offer was for a limited time only."
6, 102, "Clamps", "My clamps!"
6, 102, "Fry", "Why, Zoidberg?! Why?!"
6, 102, "Zoidberg", "Because our friend Francis here is in reality... A bad murderer."
6, 102, "Billy West", "Yup. He was fixin' to kill me.  This here crawdad done saved my life!"
6, 102, "Bella", "Bender, you two-timing jerk!  I put off my singing career for you! And, if I can't have you,  no one can!"
6, 102, "Billy West", "Aw, shucks."
6, 102, "Fry", "Bender!"
6, 102, "Leela", "No!"
6, 102, "Hermes", "What?"
6, 102, "Donbot", "Bender was a helluva squealer.  Maybe the best there ever was. We'll send his widow some meatballs. Clamps, Bella, get in the way-back."
6, 102, "Fry", "To my friend Bender. A wise man once said he was a helluva squealer.  Maybe the best there ever was."
6, 102, "All", "To Bender!"
6, 102, "Bender", "You pizzas gonna be another minute.  We are still waitin' for it to be delivered."
6, 102, "Fry", "Bender?!"
6, 102, "Bender", "I'm no Bender. You got me mixed up with another Robot."
6, 102, "Fry", "You're probably right.  I don't really remember what he looks like."
6, 102, "Bender", "Guys! Guys! It's me, Bender!"
6, 102, "Fry", "He's alive!"
6, 102, "Leela", "So that Moon hillbilly who got murdered was just an innocent husband and father!"
6, 102, "Professor Farnsworth", "Bender, old bot, the Mafia thinks you're dead! You can come back to work with us!"
6, 102, "Bender", "I'm back, baby!"
6, 102, "Brown-haired man", "Pizza's here."
6, 102, "Bender", "Woo!  I'll just cut that."
6, 102, "Zoidberg", "You do and I'll -ing gut you like a fish!"
6, 103, "Leela", "Where's the Professor?"
6, 103, "Bender", "Eh, probably dead. Already dissolving in a bathtub if we're lucky."
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "I was out on the widow's walk keeping a hopeless vigil for the return of my first delivery crew.  It's been fifty years since they disappeared."
6, 103, "Fry", "Huh. I knew you had other crews, but you never told us you had a first crew."
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "I remember it like it was interesting."
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "I had just built my new shipping and receiving emporium."
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "And I scoured the hardware-store parking lot to assemble the finest crew imaginable."
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "There was Candy, the raunchy by-the-books navigator...  Lifter, the devastatingly handsome forklift...  And Captain Lando Tucker, a dedicated young man with no characteristics."
6, 103, "Lando Tucker", "We'll deliver that package or die trying."
6, 103, "Zoidberg", "Eh! It's all my favourite patients. And also Captain Tucker. Pow!"
6, 103, "Candy", "Whoa!"
6, 103, "Lando Tucker", "You totally got me, Dr. John.  You're hilarious."
6, 103, "Hermes", "Zoidberg was popular?!"
6, 103, "Amy", "Zoidberg had hair?!"
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "I never said he had hair!  If you chose to imagine 'im that way, that's your business.  Anyway..."
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "The time came for our first delivery."
6, 103, "Young woman", "Lando, don't forget about me and Junior."
6, 103, "Lando Tucker", "I won't, honey.  Or die trying."
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "Well, crew, this is it. That cookie bouquet isn't going to deliver itself."
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "Ten..."
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "Nine and so on. Three...  Two...  One."
6, 103, "Scientist", "Go, you big metal bird! Get up there!"
6, 103, "Hermes", "Incredible!  Zoidberg had friends?!"
6, 103, "Zoidberg", "It was a different time."
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "Everything was going smoothly until right after that part I was just telling you about.  Suddenly, Amanda's aunt called to say her niece hadn't received her cookie bouquet."
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "I watched the skies for weeks. With only occasional breaks to tender my grief diarrhea."
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "Just when all hope was lost..."
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "The ship's escape pod!  What happened up there, Johnny?"
6, 103, "Zoidberg", "Aw! Don't make me remember! So horrible, it was."
6, 103, "Amy", "I thought you said he didn't have hair."
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "Yes, but something he saw on that mission traumatised 'im so severely, he grew hair!  Just so it could turn white! Sadly, my brave crew was gone forever."
6, 103, "Leela", "That poor, incompetent crew.  What do you think happened, Professor?"
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "They were lost in the Bermuda Tetrahedron!"
6, 103, "Leela", "That's ridiculous.  The Bermuda Tetrahedron is just a myth."
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "I'm glad you're so brave in the face of the unknown, Leela.  Because, for your next mission, you'll be flying directly through...  The Bermuda Tetrahedron!"
6, 103, "Leela", "Or we could fly around it."
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "Of course you could! You'd be stupid not to."
6, 103, "Bender", "Supposing we're not stupid, what kinda stupid mission is this?!"
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "You'll be picking up a monument commemorating my lost crew.  To be unveiled Tuesday at their memorial ceremony. All the grieving families will be there.  Plus, a popsicle cart!"
6, 103, "Leela", "You can count on us, Professor. We'll get that monument here in time."
6, 103, "Bender", "Hooray!"
6, 103, "Amy", "Woohoo!"
6, 103, "Bender", "Yeah!"
6, 103, "Leela", "Or die trying."
6, 103, "Zoidberg", "We're gonna try— What?"
6, 103, "Green Alien", "'Ere you go. ""In memory of the 1st Planet Express ship and it's crew""."
6, 103, "Leela", "Hang on.  It's shouldn't have an apostrophe. This means and it is crew. What the hell's wrong with you?!"
6, 103, "Green Alien", "It's a minor error, lady. I mean, we're space Aliens.  It's a miracle we can even speak English."
6, 103, "Leela", "The miracle is that I'm not kickin' your ass!  I insist you recarve the entire statue correctly."
6, 103, "Green Alien", "Okay. Okay.  Hey, Charlie! Hack off another block of ivory!"
6, 103, "Amy", "Well, the statue's perfect now."
6, 103, "Amy", "Too bad we won't make it back in time for the memorial service.Leela"
6, 103, "Leela", "We'll make it. Or die trying."
6, 103, "Fry", "Whoa!"
6, 103, "Leela", "We're cutting through the Bermuda Tetrahedron."
6, 103, "Bender", "Woo!  Wait. The Bermuda Tetrahedron?"
6, 103, "Zoidberg", "Aw... I think I'm remembering that thing I forgot."
6, 103, "Amy", "Uh-oh. The dials are terrified!"
6, 103, "Leela", "Brace yourselves. It's Tickle Me Elmo's fire!"
6, 103, "Bender", "Ow."
6, 103, "Leela", "There. See? It was no big thing."
6, 103, "Hermes", "What was that big thing?"
6, 103, "Fry", "It's a spaceship graveyard.   Why did we have to come 'ere at night?"
6, 103, "Hermes", "Look at all these famous lost ships.  There's the Garmin.  And the TomTom."
6, 103, "Leela", "Over there! It's the original Planet Express ship!"
6, 103, "Amy", "What caused all that damage?"
6, 103, "Amy", "Could it've been flavour-blasted?"
6, 103, "Leela", "We'd better investigate.  Looks like an Ion Storm, though.  Everyone suit up!"
6, 103, "Leela", "Whatever happened here, that first crew left in a hurry.  The table is still set from McDonald's value dinner!"
6, 103, "Zoidberg", "I remember. I remember!  This is what traumatised me. Such a meal to got to waste!  And, with that...  I have closure."
6, 103, "Amy", "Hey, Zoidberg. You're cockatieling."
6, 103, "Zoidberg", "Oh, no.  Something's happening!  What's happening?!"
6, 103, "Zoidberg", "Oh, right! And there was a giant killer space whale."
6, 103, "Bender", "Holy crap!  It's a giant space fish!"
6, 103, "Leela", "Actually, the space whale isn't a space fish.  It's a space mammal."
6, 103, "Bender", "Wow, interesting. I'm both impressed and being eaten."
6, 103, "Hermes", "Spacewalk, people! Spacewalk for your lives!"
6, 103, "Fry", "Man, look at 'im go! Like a millionaire on a cocktail wiener."
6, 103, "Zoidberg", "Woob."
6, 103, "Leela", "I did it! I outran 'im!"
6, 103, "Zoidberg", "Relax, friends."
6, 103, "Zoidberg", "Panic, jerks!"
6, 103, "Hermes", "That's no ordinary space whale!  It's a four-dimensional space whale!"
6, 103, "Amy", "Of course! And it only breaches into our 3-D universe to hunt and fill its lungs with vacuum!"
6, 103, "Leela", "Whatever its beef is, our one mission now is to get that monument to Earth."
6, 103, "Leela", "Correction"
6, 103, "Amy", "Shmeesh! He gonked off the engines!"
6, 103, "Leela", "That won't stop me!  Raise the solar sails. I'm goin' after that ""Möbius Dick""."
6, 103, "Hermes", "You been hittin' the Red Stripe, woman!"
6, 103, "Leela", "Comport yourself, Mr. Conrad! When we're at space, the Captain's word is law.  I could marry you and Bender against your will if I wanted to."
6, 103, "Hermes", "You wouldn't dare!"
6, 103, "Bender", "I've been married to worse."
6, 103, "Fry", "Leela, I'm no doctor, but I'm afraid you be exhibiting symptoms of illin'.  You're risking all our lives for your own personal obsession."
6, 103, "Leela", "There's nothing personal about this!  That thing screwed up my delivery! This time,  it's business!"
6, 103, "Leela", "Maybe, if I move the compass like this, it will somehow kill the whale."
6, 103, "Amy", "Leela, we need to talk. You've gone from crazy like a fox to crazy like Fox News!"
6, 103, "Leela", "Fear not the space behemoth.  In my dreams, I've peered beyond its eyes and into the cackling hell within us all."
6, 103, "Fry", "Okay...  That's a good point."
6, 103, "Bender", "Fry's right! Let's kill the Captain and order some strippers!   Yeah, what he said.   It's a mutiny led by Fry!"
6, 103, "Leela", "That's enough insubordination, Mr. Fry!"
6, 103, "Bender", "String 'im up!"
6, 103, "Bender", "Things look bad enough without having to look closer at them.  Look! Off in the distance! It's exhaling!"
6, 103, "Leela", "Use boaty talk!"
6, 103, "Bender", "Thare she blows!"
6, 103, "Leela", "Alright.  Which of you space dogs has the guts and know-how to harpoon that whale?"
6, 103, "Amy", "I spent a semester in Africa harpooning giraffes. And giraffes are basically just land space whales."
6, 103, "Leela", "Miss Wong, you have the 'poon."
6, 103, "Amy", "Oh, God! I'm having a Serengeti flashback!  Die, you dirty giraffe!"
6, 103, "Amy", "Well, I got it. Now what, Captain?"
6, 103, "Leela", "You know, I'm not sure.  I guess I thought whales died when you harpooned them."
6, 103, "Leela", "Don't worry."
6, 103, "Leela", "I'll drop the anchor."
6, 103, "Zoidberg", "Ouch."
6, 103, "Hermes", "She's diving into the fourth dimension!"
6, 103, "Amy", "We have to cut the rope!"
6, 103, "Leela", "Negative, Sailor Moon.  We're goin' for a sleigh ride."
6, 103, "Hermes", "I can see sideways in time."
6, 103, "Amy", "Gee, I see CGI.  IGC ees I, eej."
6, 103, "Fry", "Poop!  Poop!"
6, 103, "Bender", "Aw, yeah.   Bender! Bender! Bender!"
6, 103, "Bender", "Aw. That was the greatest uncountably infinite bunch of guys I ever met."
6, 103, "Amy", "Look out!  It's pulling us through a field of spacebergs!"
6, 103, "Bender", "Stupid rocks!  Think they're so great!"
6, 103, "Amy", "Well, they are giant diamonds."
6, 103, "Bender", "What?!"
6, 103, "Bender", "Come to papa!"
6, 103, "Fry", "A lotta Bender fell outta the crow's nest!  We need to cut the line!"
6, 103, "Leela", "Enough of your mad obsession with Bender, Fry! We've got to murder that whale or die trying."
6, 103, "Hermes", "This has gone too far!  Bender's one of Planet Express' most expensive appliances! And he's in trouble!"
6, 103, "Leela", "That's it!  I warned you. Fry, Zoidberg, I now pronounce you man and—"
6, 103, "Zoidberg", "Aw! So close."
6, 103, "Leela", "Unsit me, Mr. Conrad. We can't let the whale win! Hi-yah!   You're all too weak!  I can see that now. So I'll have to be my own crew!  Understood?  You've gone mad, Captain.  That's enough outta me!  Now come on! I gotta find that whale.  I found 'im!  With my Oxo Good Grips Cheese knife, I stab at thee.  You do know I'm stabbing at thee, right?"
6, 103, "Zoidberg", "Hello."
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "Think, Zoidberg.  You must remember something!"
6, 103, "Zoidberg", "No! Nothing! For all I know, our friends could've been eaten by some kind of crazy space whale!"
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "Damn that Bermuda Tetrahedron!  It's taken my latest crew just as it took my first one!"
6, 103, "Zoidberg", "Not to mention those single socks from the dryer. Am I right?"
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "Shut up, Zoidberg!   Oh, Zoidberg!  The grieving relatives will be gathered here tomorrow in need of comfort.  And, with no stone monument, they may well demand that I refund their admission fees."
6, 103, "Leela", "Where are we?Hermes"
6, 103, "Hermes", "In the belly of the beast."
6, 103, "Fry", "Like that Bible guy who got swallowed by the whale! Pinocchio!"
6, 103, "Amy", "This is all Obsessy Bessy's fault!"
6, 103, "Bender", "Right on, sister. We should be back at Planet Express right now. Hiding from work in the ceiling. But no!"
6, 103, "Leela", "For the last time, I'm not obsessed. I just want this whale to die, die, die!"
6, 103, "Hermes", "Uh-oh. What's that loud digesting sound?"
6, 103, "Fry", "Holy crap! Four-dimensional bowels!"
6, 103, "Amy", "Einstein was right."
6, 103, "Leela", "Why?!  Why?!  Also, what and how?!"
6, 103, "Male voice", "The great fish has chosen you for a higher purpose."
6, 103, "Leela", "It's a great mammal!  See? It's got whiskers! And I saw it lactating earlier.  Wait.  Who said that?"
6, 103, "Deformed man", "I was once Lando Tucker, captain of the first Planet Express ship."
6, 103, "Leela", "Ew! I'm Turanga Leela, captain of the current Planet Express ship. What's going on?"
6, 103, "Lando Tucker", "It's very simple. Well, actually, it's very complicated. Luckily, I'm here to explain it. You see... This space whale feeds on... Obsession!"
6, 103, "Leela", "Wow. Are you gross-looking. Go on."
6, 103, "Lando Tucker", "The great space serpent—"
6, 103, "Leela", "Mammal."
6, 103, "Lando Tucker", "Figured out long ago that no one's more obsessed than space captains."
6, 103, "Leela", "Oh!  What are these things?!  Get away!"
6, 103, "Lando Tucker", "The whale's nearly sucked me dry. It'll need a new source of obsession once I'm gone."
6, 103, "Leela", "How many times do I have to tell other people? I'm not obsessed!"
6, 103, "Lando Tucker", "The whale is obsession, Leela! And you are the whale!"
6, 103, "Leela", "I am not the whale! All I wanted was to complete my delivery. Is that too much to ask? One chicken-pickin' delivery? This whale's gonna pay! It can't escape what it already is. Me! I am the whale!   See?"
6, 103, "Old lady", "Fifty years, Junior! Fifty years of grippling sorrow!"
6, 103, "Paper-hatted salesman", "Popsicles here. Can't mourn the dead without a popsicle."
6, 103, "Leo", "You think a popsicle gonna bring my daughter back?!"
6, 103, "Paper-hatted salesman", "No, sir."
6, 103, "Leo", "You just talked yourself out of a sale."
6, 103, "Inez", "Poor Amy! My days of joy and luck are over!  Guess I gotta quit that club."
6, 103, "Morris", "I can't believe our Leela's gone!"
6, 103, "Munda", "You always think you're gonna disappear in space before your children."
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "Welcome, everyone.  What a pleasure to see so many miserable faces."
6, 103, "Zoidberg", "Mmm! Lemony!"
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "I had intended to unveil a beautiful stone memorial today. But, due to the recent tragedy, I humbly ask you to join me in a simple prayer."
6, 103, "Munda, Morris, Inez, Leo, Dwight, and LaBarbara", "Boo!"
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "No refunds!  Shut up and bow your heads!  Oh, mighty Isis—"
6, 103, "Zoidberg", "Oh, no!  My deal is doing the thing!"
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "Good Lord! It's some kind of inter-dimensional space whale!"
6, 103, "Zoidberg", "I just remembered.  That's the guy!  Oy! Now with the horror hair."
6, 103, "Paper-hatted salesman", "Popsicles! Fill your gapin' mouth with a popsicle!"
6, 103, "Munda", "Leela!  You're alive!  Is that how you and your friends are dressing now?!"
6, 103, "Leela", "Hello, everyone. I suppose you're wonderin' why my flesh has melded with that of a giant space whale."
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "I'll admit to a polite interest."
6, 103, "Leela", "At first, I was consumed by a dark obsession to kill the whale. Then I was consumed by the whale."
6, 103, "Zoidberg", "That sounds clever, but it doesn't explain much."
6, 103, "Leela", "Shut up, Zoidberg!"
6, 103, "Zoidberg", "Okay."
6, 103, "Leela", "You see, beneath my obsession lay an even deeper obsession. An obsession so strong, it allowed me to overpower the beast's will and pilot it through space and time. An obsession... With completing my  delivery!"
6, 103, "Paper-hatted salesman", "Get your—"
6, 103, "Old lady", "Poor Lando...  This is just how I want to remember him."
6, 103, "Leela", "Too bad! 'Cause he's still alive!"
6, 103, "Old lady", "Lando?"
6, 103, "Lando Tucker", "Told you I'd be back.   You've grown, Junior."
6, 103, "Old man", "I'm sixty-one."
6, 103, "Inez", "I dunno him! What else you got?!"
6, 103, "Professor Farnsworth", "They haven't aged a day!  The whale must have some kind of Möbius colon that endlessly recycles time and space!"
6, 103, "Scruffy", "Yup. That stands up to scrutiny."
6, 103, "Leela", "I should've listened to my crew.  That space whale wasn't a monster.  It was the obsession of me and others like me that made it into a monster."
6, 103, "Lando Tucker", "Mainly you."
6, 103, "Leela", "On the other hand, the stupid fish did eat us. You guys wanna do this?"
6, 103, "Amy", "Yeah!"
6, 103, "Fry", "You know it!"
6, 103, "Candy", "So, Johnny, are we gonna pick up where we left off?"
6, 103, "Zoidberg", "Eh!"
6, 104, "Fry", "After centuries as a delivery boy, nothin' surprises me."
6, 104, "Zoidberg", "You stink, loser."
6, 104, "Leela", "Hey, Fry!  Pizza goin' out. Come on!"
6, 104, "Fry", "Alright. I'll take the red rocket."
6, 104, "Fry", "Hello? Pizza delivery for...  D. Frosted Wang?  Not another crank delivery! Why don't I read these things ahead of time?!  One time was funny. But, every week for ten years, not as funny."
6, 104, "Ipji", "True. Not as funny. But still somewhat funny."
6, 104, "Fry", "And... And then they burst out laughing a second time.  I've been a delivery boy for a thousand years. Isn't there any room for promotion around here?"
6, 104, "Hermes", "There'll be no promotions unless somebody dies. And, even then, only if we can bring 'em back as a zombie like Scruffy."
6, 104, "Scruffy", "Life and death are a seamless continuum."
6, 104, "Fry", "Well, could I at least get some encouragement? I could use a shot in the arm.  I got shot in the leg!"
6, 104, "Bender", "Roberto!  What are you doin' here?"
6, 104, "Roberto", "What? A fella can't drop in on ol' friends and hold 'em hostage?"
6, 104, "Zoidberg", "I'm good! And you?"
6, 104, "Smitty", "Attention, criminal Robot in the building."
6, 104, "Smitty", "Come out with your hands up."
6, 104, "Bender", "Never!"
6, 104, "Smitty", "Uh, other guy."
6, 104, "Roberto", "Listen up, piggies! I want a hovercopter. And a non-marked sandwich. And a new face with, like, a... A Hugh Grant look."
6, 104, "Roberto", "And, every five minutes I don't get it, someone's gonna get stabbed in the ass!"
6, 104, "Zoidberg", "He's bluffing.  Ouch!"
6, 104, "Zoidberg", "He's not bluffing!"
6, 104, "URL", "You call for a chopper?"
6, 104, "Roberto", "Nah. I specifically said hovercopter."
6, 104, "URL", "One chopper comin' up."
6, 104, "Smitty", "You know, URL.  Sometimes it's almost too much for me."
6, 104, "URL", "You mean the respect we get and the high level of job satisfaction?"
6, 104, "Smitty", "There's that, but I'm also talkin' about the non-stop promotions and the free hot ride."
6, 104, "Leela", "I do love a man in uniform.  I mean a uniform that doesn't involve short pants."
6, 104, "Fry", "I can see I have no future here. My only option is to resign with dignity.  Here are my shorts."
6, 104, "Fry", "Hello. I'd like to enrol in Police Academy."
6, 104, "Policeman #1", "You think you can just waltz in here with no pants and become a cop?"
6, 104, "Fry", "That's the plan."
6, 104, "Policeman #1", "I like you, kid. I got no pants on either."
6, 104, "Fry", "I can see that. You're quite a bit taller than me."
6, 104, "Policeman #1", "Welcome to Police Academy."
6, 104, "Fry", "Hi! I'm Fry."
6, 104, "Brown Robot", "I'm the Sound Effects 5000."
6, 104, "Fry", "Wow! That would be impressive if you were a Human!"
6, 104, "Sound Effects 5000", "Yeah..."
6, 104, "Policeman #2", "On your feet for Chief O'Mannahan."
6, 104, "Chief O'Mannahan", "At ease, cadets. I'll make this short and sweet 'cause I'm PMS-in' like a lumberjack. Police Academy is not for everybody. You're gonna get your boobs scuffed. But, if you got the vulva to stick it out, I'll be proud to call you ladies policemen."
6, 104, "Fry", "Sir! Yes, ma'am!"
6, 104, "Black-haired man", "Yeah. That's great.  Now can you actually turn on the ignition?"
6, 104, "Sound Effects 5000", "I don't have any hands."
6, 104, "Chief O'Mannahan", "Well, it's that time of the month. Graduation Day. So grow up hair and put 'em together for our new officers."
6, 104, "Amy", "Woohoo!"
6, 104, "Bender", "Hooray for the pigs!"
6, 104, "Chief O'Mannahan", "Graduates, you are hereby officially cops. Now movin' along. Nothin' to see here."
6, 104, "Zoidberg", "Hooray! Free sky sticks!  Ooh.  Police brutality!"
6, 104, "Chief O'Mannahan", "Nice...   Alright. Before we head out, I'll be teaming up our new officers with their ironically matched partners. Sound Effects 5000, you'll be with Gretsky."
6, 104, "Gretsky", "Ow, my tinnitus!"
6, 104, "Chief O'Mannahan", "Fry, due to the unfortunate loss of Officer Smith, you'll be riding with URL."
6, 104, "URL", "And Smitty was just a few days from retirement."
6, 104, "Fry", "Wuh— What happened?"
6, 104, "URL", "He took a early retirement. Damn."
6, 104, "Professor Farnsworth", "Let's get down to business."
6, 104, "Amy", "Aren't you gonna say  Good news, everyone?"
6, 104, "Professor Farnsworth", "No, I just said that for Fry's benefit. May the poor fellow feel better about his pointless job."
6, 104, "Hermes", "As much as I miss 'im, he didn't really serve much purpose around here.  Though he did walk Zoidberg."
6, 104, "Professor Farnsworth", "In any case, I've improved on Fry by sticking some wheels on a board so Leela and Bender can easily make the next delivery without him."
6, 104, "Bender", "Neat. So where are we goin'?"
6, 104, "Professor Farnsworth", "Pandora."
6, 104, "Leela", "That dangerous, 3-D planet? Can't we just send our avatars?"
6, 104, "Professor Farnsworth", "No! It's cheaper just to have you die."
6, 104, "Fry", "Whoa! Fifteen miles over the speed of light."
6, 104, "URL", "That's a violation of the law of Lorentz invariance, baby."
6, 104, "Fry", "Light 'em up."
6, 104, "URL", "Look out for that particular individual."
6, 104, "Dandy Jim", "An electric wall, eh? I can't see the harm in peein' on that."
6, 104, "URL", "Whoa! Where my man learn that?"
6, 104, "Fry", "SunnyD commercial."
6, 104, "URL", "Let's refract this sucker."
6, 104, "Fry", "DNA and career chip, please."
6, 104, "URL", "Erwin Schrödinger, huh? What's in the box, Schrödinger?"
6, 104, "Erwin Schrödinger", "Um... A cat, some poison, und a caesium atom."
6, 104, "Fry", "The cat! Is it alive or dead?  Alive or dead?!"
6, 104, "URL", "Answer him, fool."
6, 104, "Erwin Schrödinger", "It's a superposition of both states until you open it and collapse the wave function."
6, 104, "Fry", "Says you."
6, 104, "URL", "There's also a lotta drugs in there."
6, 104, "Leela", "So... You're a Robot?"
6, 104, "Chief O'Mannahan", "You boys did good. Nailed a major violator of the laws of Physics."
6, 104, "URL", "He's goin' down.  Cat's gonna testify."
6, 104, "Chief O'Mannahan", "Guys like this really bust my uterus. You're both getting a promotion! Ever heard of the Future Crimes Division?"
6, 104, "Fry", "Tomorrow I have."
6, 104, "Leela", "Oops."
6, 104, "Leela", "I can't make out a thing!"
6, 104, "Bender", "Well, I guess you should've had two eyes!"
6, 104, "Leela", "Just deliver the package and let's get outta here."
6, 104, "Bender", "Screw that!  I ain't no delivery boy! I'm the company's chef."
6, 104, "Leela", "Oh! You're the chef, are you?  Then why don't you make us something nice to eat?"
6, 104, "Bender", "I'll make you something—   Here's your damn peanut butter and jelly sandwich!"
6, 104, "Blond man", "Now that we can predict crimes with 99% accuracy, we can arrest most perpetrators before they even perpetrate anything."
6, 104, "Fry", "That's ridiculous. Only horoscopes can predict the future."
6, 104, "Blond man", "That's what we used to think. Until we invented...  This."
6, 104, "Fry", "Whoa!"
6, 104, "URL", "Slowed on, baby."
6, 104, "Blond man", "The cybernetic oracle. The ultimate man-machine hybrid. Programmed with every crime ever recorded and implanted with the brain cells of History's greatest detectives. We call 'im... Pickles."
6, 104, "Fry", "On account of it's like he's floating in a jar?"
6, 104, "Blond man", "Exactly. The oracle's visions are recorded on these coloured balls. [The blond man lifts up a box containing four balls"
6, 104, "Fry", "What's pink pocodots?"
6, 104, "Blond man", "Clown slaughter. It happens more often than you think.  Clutter in the ball!  Red ball, homicide!"
6, 104, "Fry", "Woo!"
6, 104, "Blond man", "Suspect"
6, 104, "Hattie", "My kajigger!"
6, 104, "Blond man", "Victim"
6, 104, "Fry", "Look! The clock says 5"
6, 104, "URL", "Uh-oh. We only have a half hour to chill out before we head over."
6, 104, "Old man", "Oh, Hattie. When I look into your one good eye, I see a reflection of beauty."
6, 104, "Hattie", "Oh, fresh."
6, 104, "URL", "Freeze, fool."
6, 104, "Fry", "You're under arrest for future murder!"
6, 104, "Old man", "Ja?  You can't arrest me for future murder after it's right-now murder!"
6, 104, "Hattie", "My kajigger!  So he didn't really wanna marry me?"
6, 104, "URL", "Nah. See, he knew you'd left everything to your parakeets in your will."
6, 104, "Fry", "He was gonna murder you, marry your parakeets, and then poison them with an arsenic-laced cuttlebone."
6, 104, "URL", "Classic move. Aw, yeah."
6, 104, "Chief O'Mannahan", "Congratulations on your big bust."
6, 104, "Fry", "You too."
6, 104, "Chief O'Mannahan", "Keep it up and you boys might just make detective. Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta go drop a big one."
6, 104, "Fry", "Wow! I can't believe it. One more promotion and I'll be a real detective. Like Sherlock Holmes or Speed Buggy."
6, 104, "Chief O'Mannahan", "Eight pounds. I'm namin' 'er Bert!"
6, 104, "URL", "Mazel tov, Chief. That's a beautiful bathroom baby."
6, 104, "URL", "Ain't you headin' home, Phil?"
6, 104, "Fry", "In a minute. I just wanna finish this paperless work."
6, 104, "URL", "Don't stay up too late. We gotta lotta people to shoot tomorrow."
6, 104, "Fry", "Hello? Anyone?  There's never a cop around when you need one."
6, 104, "Female voice", "Green ball, larceny."
6, 104, "Fry", "The thief seems to be some sorta ghost. Or is he?  Bender?!"
6, 104, "Hermes", "Item seven.  Our corporate tax rate remained unchanged this fiscal year."
6, 104, "Amy", "That's not funny."
6, 104, "Hermes", "It's not supposed to be funny. It's a business meetin'."
6, 104, "Zoidberg", "Things used to be funny around here! Noses were picked. Pants fell down. So what changed? Only Fry could say... And he's gone!"
6, 104, "Amy", "Hey! Bender and Leela are back from Pandora. How was it?"
6, 104, "Leela", "Awful. We had nothing to say to each other.  So we had to listen to Bender's Eagles album for twenty-seven hours."
6, 104, "Bender", "Beats talkin' to you, ""Witchy Woman"".  Hey, meatbag!"
6, 104, "Hermes", "Look at you!"
6, 104, "Leela", "Hubba-hubba. Your pants go almost all the way to your ankles!"
6, 104, "Fry", "Good afternoon, individuals.  Sir, would you mind stepping outta the building?"
6, 104, "Bender", "Normally, when a cop asks me that, I spray whipped cream in his eyes and run away. But, to ditch these losers, gladly."
6, 104, "Fry", "Bender, be honest with me. Are you planning a big heist?"
6, 104, "Bender", "Usually, but not at the moment."
6, 104, "Fry", "I only ask 'cause the oracle thinks you're gonna pull of a major theft next Thursday."
6, 104, "Bender", "Next Thursday, you say? Pray, continue."
6, 104, "Fry", "Are you familiar with this particular location?"
6, 104, "Bender", "I may have a burgling familiarity with it."
6, 104, "Fry", "Does the word Maltese mean anything to you?"
6, 104, "Bender", "The Maltese Liquor?! The strongest and most valuable malt liquor ever brewed! And soon it will be mine...  I'm sorry. You were sayin'?"
6, 104, "Fry", "Bender, I'm only tellin' you this so you can avoid committing the crime."
6, 104, "Bender", """Avoid committing the crime"". Got it."
6, 104, "Fry", "You wrote ""Commit the crime""!"
6, 104, "Fry", "There's gotta be some way to stop Bender.  Maybe something in the oracle's prediction that I missed before due to incompetence.  Wait. Who's the trigger-happy jerk?  That's me. I recognise the face."
6, 104, "Bender", "You shot me. You miserable dingus!"
6, 104, "Fry", "No! No! What have I will have done?"
6, 104, "URL", "Man, that's heavy.  Osmium heavy."
6, 104, "Fry", "Are you gonna turn me in for concealing evidence?"
6, 104, "URL", "Say what? You're my partner, home-Fry.  Besides, I got my own secrets."
6, 104, "Chief O'Mannahan", "Anything big worth checkin' out?"
6, 104, "URL", "Just your big, jangly booty, baby."
6, 104, "Chief O'Mannahan", "See ya tonight, toots."
6, 104, "Fry", "You... And— And the Chief?!"
6, 104, "URL", "We been gettin' it on. Right there in your chair.  I'm like, ""Oh, baby! Oh, baby!"" And she's like,  ""Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."""
6, 104, "Fry", "I would never shoot Bender! Never! He taught me how to shave."
6, 104, "URL", "Revision ball. By decidin' not to shoot Bender, you created an alternate future."
6, 104, "Fry", "I could never shoot you! Never! You taught me how to shave."
6, 104, "Fry", "See?"
6, 104, "Fry", "Just get outta here.  Go!"
6, 104, "URL", "Now dig the unintended consequences."
6, 104, "Bender", "My friends, let us share this booze in a toast to our dear friend, Bender.  Oops."
6, 104, "URL", "The Maltese Liquor done destroyed their brains. Fools should've known it's fatal for anyone but Robots and Billy Dee Williams."
6, 104, "Fry", "So, if I don't shoot Bender, all my other friends will die?!"
6, 104, "URL", "Fate is a freaky mistress. Much like the Chief. Look out!"
6, 104, "Fry", "Somethin' is not right. I refuse to believe it. Rewind!"
6, 104, "Hedonism Bot", "Ooh. Are you the calloused working man I ordered?"
6, 104, "Bender", "Uh...  Sure."
6, 104, "Bender", "In order to fix your leaky roof, I'll need to spend two or three hours down here in the wine cellar."
6, 104, "Hedonism Bot", "I'll be upstairs putting batteries and things."
6, 104, "Bender", "Whoa!  The Maltese Liquor!  Forty ounces of Heaven!  Here, boy.  This is for you.  Ah!  Invisible safe, eh?  Aw, yeah, baby.  Two-hundred-and-ten proof."
6, 104, "Fry", "That's all the proof I need.  Put the bottle back!"
6, 104, "Bender", "We both know I won't do that! Either you're gonna shoot me or I'm gonna spray whipped cream in your eyes and walk outta here like a big shot."
6, 104, "Fry", "Bender, no! You don't have to do something just 'cause it's gonna happen! The future's making a chump outta you!"
6, 104, "Bender", "Oh, yeah?!  Well, I'm gonna make a chump outta the future! I'm not stealin' anything."
6, 104, "Fry", "Yes! I stopped the crime without shooting you. The oracle was wrong!"
6, 104, "Male voice", "Was I?"
6, 104, "Fry", "Pickles?!"
6, 104, "Pickles", "Yes. It is I, Pickles! I set the whole thing up. Everyone will think Bender's the thief, while I make off with that glorious brew."
6, 104, "Bender", "Seriously? Why?"
6, 104, "Pickles", "So I can kill my Human brain cells. Do you have any idea what a burden it is to know everything that will ever happen?! To never be surprised. To know the punch line of every joke hours in advance."
6, 104, "Fry", "Like watching Leno."
6, 104, "Pickles", "And that is why I faked the prediction of this crime. Nevertheless, stay with me here.  Things will now happen just as I fake-predicted.  Bender, you're going to hand me that bottle.  Not that one! The real one. Which you switched when Fry stupidly looked away."
6, 104, "Fry", "Hey!"
6, 104, "Bender", "Aw, man. Why do you gotta be so oracle-y?"
6, 104, "Pickles", "Fry... You are going to shoot Bender, killing him and shattering the fake bottle. Just as I predicted.  Do it! It is your destiny!"
6, 104, "Fry", "Funny thing about destiny.  Sometimes fate has other plans.  Oh, nuts."
6, 104, "Bender", "You shot me! You miserable dingus!"
6, 104, "Pickles", "And now the part I didn't show you.  Everyone will think Bender killed you.  And I walk away with a goofy juice.  Finally... Blissful ignorance! I have no idea what's going to happen next!"
6, 104, "Fry", "Did you get that, Chief?"
6, 104, "Chief O'Mannahan", "We got it all from behind this prediction-proof glass."
6, 104, "Pickles", "But... How could you know my prediction was fake?"
6, 104, "Fry", "I knew somethin' was wrong, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Then it hit me.  You showed Bender sharing the deadly booze with our friends.  Bender would never share!"
6, 104, "Bender", "The very idea!"
6, 104, "Fry", "So we set up this little charade based on an episode of Speed Buggy."
6, 104, "URL", "With the added benefit of me and the Chief bein' locked in a small room."
6, 104, "Hedonism Bot", "Shall we adjourn to the dungeon?"
6, 104, "Fry", "Well, I got my shield for stopping Bender.  But then I got fired for tipping off Bender."
6, 104, "Professor Farnsworth", "Fry, we have no idea what you do around here, but we desperately need you back."
6, 104, "Fry", "Ruh— Really? Um, I don't suppose there's any chance I can get a promotion..."
6, 104, "Professor Farnsworth", "Sure! What the heck! I hereby promote you to...  Executive delivery boy!"
6, 104, "Fry", "Executive?!"
6, 104, "Hermes", "It's a meanin'less title, but it helps insecure people feel better about themselves."
6, 104, "Fry", "I feel better about myself!"
6, 105, "Hermes", "So there it is, people. Due to budget cutbacks, we will no longer be offering free squid guts in the kitcken."
6, 105, "Professor Farnsworth", "Oh, boo-hoo! Everyone, look at my latest invention."
6, 105, "Zoidberg", "Okay."
6, 105, "Amy", "I like how it's not killing us so far."
6, 105, "Professor Farnsworth", "It takes any object and makes two smaller copies!"
6, 105, "Bender", "Why?"
6, 105, "Professor Farnsworth", "You see... As I age, I've been shrinking and feeling colder. So now I need twice as many sweaters in a smaller size. First, I scan the old sweater.  Then, we add some matter. Any old, useless matter will do.  Now, the matter prism reorganises the raw material into two smaller copies."
6, 105, "Fry", "So that's where babies' sweaters come from!"
6, 105, "The Scary Door narrator", "Enclosed as a PDF attachment, a picture of yourself in a boat on a river. It's a river that flows in two directions. Make that three. It's a magic river, that's how. And it's flowing down the eerie canal to... The Scary Door. That's eerie with two Es. [Close-up"
6, 105, "Dr. Daniel Zenus", "This Robot will do everything for me. Robot, activate yourself and do my research.  Ah!"
6, 105, "Dr. Daniel Zenus", "Next, assume my social obligations."
6, 105, "Official", "Dr. Zenus, for a lifetime of scientific achievement, we present this award to... Your Robot."
6, 105, "Boy", "Daddy, I love you."
6, 105, "Dr. Daniel Zenus", "If only I'd programmed the Robot to be more careful what I wished for. Robot, experience this tragic irony for me."
6, 105, "Robot", "No!"
6, 105, "Dr. Daniel Zenus", "Ah!"
6, 105, "Bender", "Ah!"
6, 105, "Fry", "Man, I wish we had a Robot to do stuff."
6, 105, "Bender", "I know, right?"
6, 105, "Professor Farnsworth", "Bender, thank God I found you in time. I need someone in the lab immediately to fold my new sweaters."
6, 105, "Bender", "I'm sorry. Do you see a Robot in this room named Folder?"
6, 105, "Professor Farnsworth", "Fortunately, I came prepared with a backup phrasing. Uh, Bender, would you mind bending my new sweaters? There's only two of them."
6, 105, "Bender", "Hey! Oh! You want me to do two things? Man, I'd call my lawyer if diallin' the phone wasn't such a hassle.[Scene"
6, 105, "Bender", "Razzle, frazzle, two things!  Ooh. Razzle, frazzle, duplicator.  Now for some tasty matter.  Howdy, fellas! I'm Bender."
6, 105, "Bender duplicate", "Go to hell, old man."
6, 105, "Bender", "I like your attitude. Let's party. But, first, fold these two sweaters."
6, 105, "Bender duplicates", "I'm sorry. Do you see a Robot in this room named Folder?"
6, 105, "Bender", "Damn, you're cute."
6, 105, "Bender", "Hi! I'm Bender, this is my Robot Bender, and this is my other Robot Bender."
6, 105, "Leela", "Oh, Lord."
6, 105, "Bender", "They're 60%-scaled replicas of me, Bender."
6, 105, "Leela", "Does that mean they only do 60% of the work you do or that they actually do more work because they're only 60% as lazy?"
6, 105, "Bender", "Shut up.  That's a good one."
6, 105, "Professor Farnsworth", "Enough good ones, everyone. We have a delivery to an Alien space giant."
6, 105, "Hermes", "You'll have to be respectful. This customer is fifty-feet tall and sensitive about his appearance."
6, 105, "Amy", "Colossal tooth whitener, mega deodorant, humongous acne cream... Aw, and one regular-sized condom."
6, 105, "Bender", "All that and a small wiener? This guy's got it goin' on."
6, 105, "Leela", "Remember"
6, 105, "Bender", "I hope that's vanishing cream, 'cause that needs to go away."
6, 105, "Bender duplicate", "That's cold-blooded."
6, 105, "Leela", "Shhh!"
6, 105, "Unattractive giant monster", "It's okay. I understand. My unusual appearance makes people nervous. You used humour to defuse the tension."
6, 105, "Bender", "Yup. And there's still a little more tension, so look out.  You so ugly, when trick-or-treaters come to your house, they give you candy."
6, 105, "Bender duplicate #1", "You so ugly, when you go to the bank, they ask you to put on a ski mask."
6, 105, "Bender duplicate #2", "You so ugly, you crack the Daily Mirror. It's a newspaper!"
6, 105, "Unattractive giant monster", "I wish it weren't so, but many of these things are true. Anyhow, you've lowered my self-esteem a bit more, but I'm sincerely grateful you came all this way to deliver my fungus chizzle."
6, 105, "Fry", "Don't feel bad, sir. It's not your fault. You probably just inherited your appearance from your mother."
6, 105, "Unattractive giant monster", "What?! No one insults my momma."
6, 105, "Bender", "Oh, God! Shield your eyes! It's like Edward James Olmos on IMAX."
6, 105, "Left Bender duplicate", "Did you see his face when I said he's so ugly?"
6, 105, "Right Bender duplicate", "No, I blacked out. 'Cause he's so ugly!"
6, 105, "Bender", "Hey, guys, quit reminiscing and grab me two cigars."
6, 105, "Left Bender duplicate", "One thing each?"
6, 105, "Right Bender duplicate", "Sounds fair."
6, 105, "Bender", "Wait. Make that four cigars."
6, 105, "Bender duplicates", "You want us to do four things?"
6, 105, "Hermes", "My manwich!"
6, 105, "Bender duplicate", "What's up, Shorty?"
6, 105, "Bender", "And that's the story of how one of me became two and two became four, makin' seven total. The end."
6, 105, "Leela", "I just like having the end locker. It's not like Amy cares about it at all. But no, she won't trade with me."
6, 105, "Zoidberg", "A rat!"
6, 105, "Leela", "Yes! She is a rat!"
6, 105, "Zoidberg", "No! Look!"
6, 105, "Very small Bender", "Which way to the tiny hookers?"
6, 105, "Amy", "A big, fat roach!"
6, 105, "Hermes", "What? I thought I put that away."
6, 105, "Amy", "No! There!"
6, 105, "Bender on the other side", "Who're you?"
6, 105, "Insect-sized Bender", "Bender sent me."
6, 105, "Insect-sized Bender", "Hey, I know that guy!"
6, 105, "Professor Farnsworth", "Scruffy, what is that tiny Bender doing in my soup?!"
6, 105, "Scruffy", "It appears to be giving you the finger, sir. Enjoy."
6, 105, "Bender duplicate", "Help me! Help me! I'm too lazy to escape!"
6, 105, "Bender duplicate", "Ow."
6, 105, "Bender", "What?"
6, 105, "Hermes", "This place is crawling with yous!"
6, 105, "Bender", "So there's more Benders around. As far as I'm concerned, that's good news!"
6, 105, "Professor Farnsworth", "Bad news, everyone! Look at this infinite series representing the mass of successive generations of Benders."
6, 105, "Fry", "Don't wait for me."
6, 105, "Professor Farnsworth", "It's nonconvergent!"
6, 105, "Fry", "Oh, dip!"
6, 105, "Professor Farnsworth", "Unless we quickly exterminate them, they'll replicate ad infinitum and consume all the matter on Earth.  According to my calculations, there are eleven generations at the moment.  That's 2046 total Benders we need to destroy."
6, 105, "Bender", "Wait. Does that include me?"
6, 105, "Bender", "Too bad he didn't have his own Bible."
6, 105, "Professor Farnsworth", "Just 2045 more to go!"
6, 105, "Hermes", "2045, 2046. That's it. We got 'em all except for the big one."
6, 105, "Amy", "Wait.  This isn't a real Bender. It's a talking doll from when Bender had that sitcom about the city Robot who moves back to the farm."
6, 105, "Bender doll", "Shut your pumpkin, bumpkin."
6, 105, "Bender", "Alright. So I let one measly Bender get away. How much harm can one infinitely self-reproducing Robot do?"
6, 105, "Leela", "Bender! How could you be so lazy and irresponsible?"
6, 105, "Bender", "Wait, what? Did someone say I'm great?"
6, 105, "Bender", "What's with the grey goo?"
6, 105, "Microscopic Bender", "Bite my tiny metal ass."
6, 105, "Bender", "Hey! Those jerklings ate my couch."
6, 105, "Professor Farnsworth", "Oh, God. We've opened Pandora's fly. They'll reproduce without limit, consuming all the matter in the world."
6, 105, "Fry", "Like the Kardashians."
6, 105, "Bender", "Now they drank my booze?! They've gone too far!"
6, 105, "Leela", "Wait a second. All Benders are powered by alcohol!"
6, 105, "Professor Farnsworth", "Of course! Long before the Benders devour the Earth, they'll deplete the planet's booze and die off. This is a problem that will solve itself."
6, 105, "Bender", "A problem that solves itself? That sounds like a job for me, Bender."
6, 105, "Morbo", "Our top story"
6, 105, "Linda", "I can no longer face my children!"
6, 105, "Leela", "Crisis averted. Without alcohol, the Benders are dying off!"
6, 105, "Scruffy", "A greater tragedy my eyes have never beheld. Well, into the terlet."
6, 105, "Bender", "So sober, so weak..."
6, 105, "Leela", "Things really worked out nicely this time."
6, 105, "Professor Farnsworth", "This doesn't taste like old-man water."
6, 105, "Professor Farnsworth", "Everyone to The Situation Room!"
6, 105, "Professor Farnsworth", "I was lying here, snoozing, dreaming, oddly enough, about bathing in champagne with six of the world's most distinguished scientists, when suddenly I realised my bathwater had been transformed into alcohol."
6, 105, "Bender", "Alcohol?"
6, 105, "Fry", "Chug! Chug!"
6, 105, "Bender", "It's like fine cognac with a hint of aged scrotum."
6, 105, "Leela", "How can this be? I thought the Benders drank all the alcohol in the world!"
6, 105, "Professor Farnsworth", "They did. But then they made more! You see, once the Benders reached atomic scale, they began directly manipulating water and CO2 molecules to make alcohol.  In a matter of hours, there will be no more fresh water on Earth."
6, 105, "Bender", "Oh, no! What will I mix with my Scotch?"
6, 105, "Linda", "Hey, you! Good evening. Who're you calling drunk? You're not drunk! I'm drunk."
6, 105, "Morbo", "That's right, Linda. Water is now— Now booze and everyone's tetty much protally fitshaced."
6, 105, "Linda", "Turning to sports, the Indy 500 was today. There were no survivors."
6, 105, "Amy", "This chair is so comfortable."
6, 105, "Bender", "Classic Amy."
6, 105, "Hermes", "You wanna see a picture of my boy?"
6, 105, "Zoidberg", "Sure.  That's your penis!"
6, 105, "Hermes", "That's my boy!"
6, 105, "Leela", "I guess this is a... Not so bad. As long as we don't need to use our mental... Mental..."
6, 105, "Fry", "Minds?"
6, 105, "Leela", "Wha?"
6, 105, "Fry", "No, listen. I... freakin' love you. But I don't throw that word around!"
6, 105, "Professor Farnsworth", "Oh, I know you don't. That's why I love you. Are the pizza muffins ready?"
6, 105, "Fry", "He's here for revenging. That's why."
6, 105, "Unattractive giant monster", "No! Wait! I'm here to apologise."
6, 105, "Leela", "For your looks?  Nice one."
6, 105, "Unattractive giant monster", "Well, yes, actually. It is sort of related to that. Can we talk? Grabbing your spaceship was not okay. I lost my cool and I'm sorry. In group, I learned that I tend to be a bit..."
6, 105, "Hermes", "Repulsive?"
6, 105, "Unattractive giant monster", "Sensitive. So now I'm, like, trying to work on my attitude and project an air of positivity."
6, 105, "Zoidberg", "You're projecting an air of something."
6, 105, "Amy", "You're so stinky, you need right guard and left guard."
6, 105, "Unattractive giant monster", "I'll take your hygiene advice to heart."
6, 105, "Professor Farnsworth", "You're ugly!"
6, 105, "Unattractive giant monster", "Hey! Ow!"
6, 105, "Zapp", "Yo, freakshow! Your face has been declared a weapon of mass disgusting!"
6, 105, "Kif", "Timeless."
6, 105, "Unattractive giant monster", "Okay, deep breath, deep breath.  Dr. Lesterman? I'm sorry to bother you, but I think I'm close to a temper-control incident."
6, 105, "Female voice", "You have reached the office of Dr. Judy Lesterman and Dr. Ira Rodkiss. The office is now closed. If this is a pharmacy call—"
6, 105, "Unattractive giant monster", "That's it! I promised myself I wouldn't do this, but I...  I will destroy you all.  I won't stop until your whole planet is as ugly as you perceived me to be!"
6, 105, "Zapp", "That will take a very long time."
6, 105, "Kif", "Oh, God! Stop. Stop."
6, 105, "Bender", "Ah!"
6, 105, "Fry", "Blunder? You're the only one who's sober. You gotta do somethin'."
6, 105, "Bender", "Haven't I done enough already?"
6, 105, "Fry", "Please... Stop the monster. Just do that one thing."
6, 105, "Bender", "Make it zero and you got a deal."
6, 105, "Fry", "What if I folded the Professor's sweaters for you?"
6, 105, "Bender", "Both of them?! You mean you'll do two things and I only have to do one thing?"
6, 105, "Fry", "Yeah. To save the world."
6, 105, "Fry", "Sucker."
6, 105, "Bender", "Legion of Benders, come onto me. We have one thing to do!"
6, 105, "Bender duplicates", "Screw that."
6, 105, "Bender", "Oh, come on, you lazy jerks. If we all pitch in, we each only have to do one quintillionth of a thing."
6, 105, "Bender duplicates", "Alright."
6, 105, "Bender", "Whoa. Big Bender starts right now."
6, 105, "Unattractive giant monster", "Get a shave, ugly!"
6, 105, "Bender", "How about some aftershave, dumpy?"
6, 105, "Unattractive giant monster", "You big bully!"
6, 105, "Bender", "You ugly nerd! Enjoy a nice guggenheim swirley. Let this beatin' be a lesson about never attacking those more handsome than oneself."
6, 105, "Unattractive giant monster", "All I wanted was to apologise to you people! But now I have to kill you."
6, 105, "Bender", "How? By makin' me look at you?"
6, 105, "Unattractive giant monster", "No. By makin' you look at... My momma!"
6, 105, "Bender", "Your momma's so ugly!"
6, 105, "Unattractive giant monster", "I told you not to talk about my momma!"
6, 105, "Male voice", "Walk toward the light, Bender."
6, 105, "Bender", "Aw, man. Do I have to walk?"
6, 105, "Fry", "No!"
6, 105, "Unattractive giant monster", "No! At last, I'm beautiful."
6, 105, "Bender", "Yeah, if you're in the grave dust."
6, 105, "Fry", "Bender, you did it!"
6, 105, "Bender", "No,  we did it.  Ladies and gentlemen, if together we were able to defeat this giant space monster, think how also we might defeat the monsters of poverty and disease and unliteracy. In this spirit, I ask my fellow Benders to join me in working diligently to—"
6, 105, "Bender duplicate A", "Go to hell!"
6, 105, "Bender duplicate B", "Come on. Let's go some place where we don't have to do one quintillionth of a thing all the time."
6, 105, "Bender", "Well, that was dumb."
6, 105, "Fry", "Looks like it's full of dig dogs."
6, 105, "Amy", "Man, we're way drunk. What happened, Professor?"
6, 105, "Professor Farnsworth", "Something absolutely incredible! The sweaters got folded."
6, 105, "Zoidberg", "But how?"
6, 105, "Fry", "I didn't do it. Bender, did you learn a lesson about not bein' lazy while the rest of us were bombed out of our gourds?"
6, 105, "Bender", "Maybe I did, Fry. Maybe I did. Or maybe I rescued one last mini-Bender to fold stupid, ugly sweaters while I laughed at him.  I guess we'll never know."
6, 106, "Man", "Mom on deck! Ten—"
6, 106, "Mom", "Alright, grunts. Here's your pre-mission pep talk.  Shoot anyone who doesn't obey hard enough."
6, 106, "Man", "But—"
6, 106, "Mom", "Stop gaining knowledge, Hubert! [The camera zooms out, revealing Professor Farnsworth to still have hair and be sitting on a crate. Two other crates read CONTENTS"
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Eh, something about poison. Got it. Eh, by the way, that surgeon...  Where is he?"
6, 106, "Mom", "You! Where's the butcher?!"
6, 106, "Man", "Ma'am, I dunno, ma'am. 'Is duffel bag arrived."
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "It's not a duffel bag. It's my apartment."
6, 106, "Mom", "Hubert, meet John Zoidberg.  You need an Alien hacked to pieces, he's the best there is.  In the budget category."
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Have you ever dissected a Yeti before?"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Pfff.  Himalayan or Neptunian?"
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Tritonian."
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "A Tritonian Yeti?!  You two aren't up to anything unethical, are you?!"
6, 106, "Mom", "Relax.  There's nothing unethical about covert biological weapons research.   I said, ""Relax."""
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Ah, Zoidberg.  We've known each other so long that... Sometimes, I don't think we even need words to understand each other."
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "What?"
6, 106, "Leela", "Once and for all, Fry, even though it's the future, most objects are still just objects. Not Aliens who look like objects."
6, 106, "Fry", "So my efforts to establish diplomatic relations with the cactus people were doomed from the start."
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "So you're in pain and 'ave a bunch o' needles. I prescribe acupuncture.  Let's begin.   Blood?!  I mean, ""Blood."""
6, 106, "Fry", "Put it back in me!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "I'm afraid Fry lost a lotta juice.  He's developed Simpsons jaundice."
6, 106, "Fry", "¡Ay, caramba!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "His only hope is some replacement liver. Yours looks like a good match."
6, 106, "Leela", "Well, if it'll help Fry—"
6, 106, "Fry", "Careful, Leela!  He knows less about Human anatomy than I do. And I can't even find my own uterus!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "You may feel a slight sawing!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "And all we need is a little spine supplement to replace what Leela lost in that unavoidable saw mix-up."
6, 106, "Leela", "It wasn't unavoidable!  You just had to stop cutting my spine when I yelled, ""Stop! You're cutting my spine!"""
6, 106, "Fry", "Quit complaining!  My body rejected your liver and now I've got Garfield syndrome.  I hate Mondays."
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Anyhow, Hermes, all Leela needs is one of your vertebrae."
6, 106, "Hermes", "But, Doctor, will I be able to limbo afterwards?"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Could you limbo before?  Wait. I say, ""Yes."" And you say, ""I couldn't limbo before."" You ruined the joke, Hermes!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "There you go, Leela. Good as new!"
6, 106, "Leela", "Whoa! Whoa!"
6, 106, "Fry", "Oh, sure."
6, 106, "Leela", "Whoa!"
6, 106, "Fry", "Leela's fine.  But my jaundice has progressed a Muppet gangrene. It's not easy being gangrenous."
6, 106, "Hermes", "I thought you were only gonna take out one vertebra!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Yeah, but did you ever play Jenga? Sometimes, you pull one and—"
6, 106, "Fry", "Oh, yeah? Well, I've got news for ya. I'm not stayin' like this. You're the Doctor!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Hmmm. What started out as a pleasant afternoon of drugs and surgery has not gone as planned. But don't worry. We still 'ave three or four coworkers with plenty of spare parts."
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "My first mission.  I'm so excited.  And, after I dissect the Yeti's poison glands, we can stop maybe for ice cream on the way back?  With sprinkles on?"
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Why, you're just a big kid, aren't you, Zoidberg?"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "A very big kid."
6, 106, "Man", "We're over the drop zone, gentlemen. Might I suggest you jump out the door and poop yourselves."
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "So, anyway, I hope the men 'ave been taking their hypermalaria pills."
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Their wha?!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", """Their wha?!""  That's funny. Like a crazy, old man. But you know what's not funny?  Deadly Tritonian hypermalaria. Just be sure to stay outta the methane swamps.  What smells like methane?"
6, 106, "Doctor", "My God. I've never seen such a gruesome shark attack.  Especially this far inland."
6, 106, "Leela", "It wasn't a shark. It was an awful, incompetent doctor."
6, 106, "Doctor", "Wow. He must've been a total Zoidberg."
6, 106, "Hermes", "It was Zoidberg! He brutalised us with power tools, gypsy curses, and hypnosis!"
6, 106, "Amy", "Yes, master."
6, 106, "Doctor", "You'll all get through this. I give you my word as a real doctor."
6, 106, "Bender", "What about me?"
6, 106, "Doctor", "What did 'e do to you?"
6, 106, "Bender", "I dunno exactly, but...   I'm incontinent."
6, 106, "Doctor", "I'm truly sorry."
6, 106, "Fry", "I consider myself a reasonable man. Quick with a joke. Slow to anger. But Bender can't go on long car trips anymore an' I say Zoidberg must die!"
6, 106, "Hermes", "People, please!  Let's not overreact—  Death to the crab!"
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "How bad is it, Doctor?"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Super bad. It's Tritonian hypermalaria.  A lot of these men will be dead within twenty-four hours."
6, 106, "Man", "What?!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Not you, though!  You'll make a complete recovery and go on to marry a super model!  Funny plague, hypermalaria.  It can kill immediately. Or lie dormant for decades. But, sooner or later, it erupts, causing fever, spasms, madness, coma, and finally... Death."
6, 106, "Man", "What?!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Super model!"
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Oh!  Those poor, doomed bastards. I guess it's up to me to complete the mission."
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "I'll be in the swamp, blowing the smirk off a toxic Yeti."
6, 106, "Hermes", "Professor, we need to talk!  Man-to-mob.   You need to listen to us! Yes, you do!"
6, 106, "Leela", "We've had it with Zoidberg!  We demand you fire him!"
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Nonsense! Zoidberg's a fine physician.  For Aliens.  Your mistake is being Humans! No. If I'm going to fire anyone, it'll be Scruffy."
6, 106, "Hermes", "Ya can't do that!"
6, 106, "Bender", "What did Scruffy ever do to you?!"
6, 106, "Amy", "Over my dead body!"
6, 106, "Bender", "Don't you get it, old man?  Thanks to Dr. Scissor Hands, I wet myself every time I laugh.  It's not funny! Well... I guess it is kinda funny.  Uh-oh."
6, 106, "Hermes", "Why are you protecting Zoidberg, Professor?  Do you owe him something?"
6, 106, "Leela", "Is he blackmailing you somehow?"
6, 106, "Amy", "What does 'e have on you?!  Why have you kept 'im around all these years when 'e's so grossly incompetent?!"
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Long ago, Zoidberg an' I entered into a secret arrangement relating to certain extraordinary events too horrible to reveal.   So there's nothing to be curious about!"
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Stop or I'll shoot!   Zoidberg?!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "You can't hunt a Yeti by yourself, sir.  It's suicidal."
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "So what?!  I'm going to die of hypermalaria, anyway. I was in the same swamp as the rest of the men."
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Just because you were in the swamp, doesn't necessarily mean—"
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "I was thirsty from the flight! I drank swamp water! Look, Zoidberg.  You're a loyal friend."
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Friend?!"
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "But I'm doomed.  I might as well capture a Yeti and die trying."
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Then you'll need someone to dissect it!  Friend."
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Go, Johnny! Go!  That's an order!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Never! Zoidberg doesn't abandon a friend apparently."
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Ooh! Ooh-ho-ho!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "I'll save us! By scaring 'im off with my crazy war noise!  Crunch all you want. I'll make more."
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Oy.  I lost another one."
6, 106, "Leela", "Zoidberg...   I'm sorry to break it to you this way, but we hate you and we never wanna see you again."
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "But, friends—"
6, 106, "Hermes", "We're not your friends! We're your victims!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "I was just trying to—"
6, 106, "Amy", "Shut up and give me my kidney back!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "I'm sorry.  I'm sorry."
6, 106, "Fry", "We dunno why the Professor keeps you around here and we don't care!   You're a terrible doctor!   Nobody wants to see you ever again!"
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Dr. Zoidberg, I want to see you right now!"
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "The time 'as come, my friend.  We have to talk about... Our arrangement."
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Oh, no!  No! No!  Oh, no, no, no! Oh, no!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Oh, no!"
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Unpaw him, you big ape!  I saw this in a Tarzan movie.  It was called...  Tarzan versus the Yetis.  I lost my virginity...  Ooh! During the film. So I'm... Hah!  A little fuzzy on the details.  Oh!  John...  Are you alright?"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "You!  You saved my life!"
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Oh, fuff."
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Yes, fuff.  How can I ever repay you?! Do you need a slave?  Or maybe a butler?"
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "No, I haven't needed a butler since grad school. But I do need a doctor.  I don't wanna die like those marines, John.  The fever! The madness!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Don't forget the spasms, coma, and death."
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "I don't want to go through that!  I want you to kill me!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Alright.  Give me the knife."
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Not now!  Hypermalaria can lie dormant for years.  Isn't that what you said?"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "It sounds like something I would say."
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "So stay with me until the symptoms start. Then...  Put me out of my misery. You must swear!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Alright, Hubert.  I swear."
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "It's started, Zoidberg. The fever. The muscle spasms.  I'm dying.  It's time for you to keep your promise and kill me."
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "This is very difficult.  But I'll try...  Friend."
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "No! Wait!  I'm afraid to die!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Argh!  You said you wanted me to kill you!  Is this one o' those ""No means yes"" deals?!"
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Yes and no.  I do want you to kill me. But I mustn't see it coming. That would be agony!  So you must murder me completely by surprise."
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "As God is my witness, you can count on me.  Well... See you tomorrow."
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Not surprising enough!"
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Eh, wha?! Oh!  My...  Heart!"
6, 106, "Fry", "Hey!"
6, 106, "Leela", "What are you doing there?"
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Stop! You don't understand!"
6, 106, "Leela", "Let's go, you murderer! Fry, help me lock 'im up!"
6, 106, "Fry", "Hang on. I'm learnin' how to do loop-de-loops."
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Whoa! Whoa! Woo!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "You're making a mistake! I was only trying to kill the Professor!"
6, 106, "Bender", "Ooh."
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Hubert... I'm sorry.  Wha?! He doesn't have hair.  Great Little Caesar's ghost!"
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "You fools!  You stupid, life-prolonging fools!  I asked Zoidberg to kill me!"
6, 106, "Amy", "Huh?!"
6, 106, "Bender", "What you talkin' 'bout, Professor?!"
6, 106, "Hermes", "Professor, have you gone mad?!"
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Probably!  It's one o' the symptoms of Tritonian hypermalaria!"
6, 106, "Amy", "You mean the incurable disease that causes fever...  Spasms...  Insanity...  Coma...  And finally death?!"
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Yes! And I begged Zoidberg to put me out of my misery!  Bring 'im!  Quickly!"
6, 106, "Scruffy", "Hmmm. Should've known better than to store my antiques in the office."
6, 106, "Leela", "Zoidberg, we were wrong!  We're letting you out so you can kill the Professor!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop."
6, 106, "Amy", "Oh, no!  He sand-crabbed out!"
6, 106, "Leela", "Then we have no choice. We'll have to mercy-kill the Professor ourselves."
6, 106, "Bender", "Well, let's get started."
6, 106, "Walt", "We have a situation, Mother. This creature tried to sand-crab into the building."
6, 106, "Mom", "Zoidberg?!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Sorry I didn't call first, Carol. Uh... But I'm in a hurry! I need your help to save Hubert!"
6, 106, "Mom", "Let him go  and stooge the hell out of here!"
6, 106, "Larry", "We're on it."
6, 106, "Walt", "Ow!"
6, 106, "Igner", "Ow!"
6, 106, "Larry", "Ow!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Beautiful kids. You must be very proud!"
6, 106, "Mom", "John Zoidberg... It's been a long time. How've you been?"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Not too bad.  Last year, I took a bus trip to the Grand Canyon.  Later, I'll show you the pictures."
6, 106, "Mom", "Do you ever regret it, John?  Leaving me to work for the Professor?"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "What do you want me to say?  'E saved my life."
6, 106, "Mom", "Oh, big deal! You could've been rich if you'd stayed.  Your own lab... A full staff..."
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "But Hubert is my friend.  'E's very sick.  I can cure him. But I need the thing! The thing...  From Triton!"
6, 106, "Mom", "It'll cost you, John.  How much are you worth now?"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "I live in a dumpster.  All I have in the world is this coupon for one free session at the tanning salon."
6, 106, "Mom", "Oh, John.  That's really all you have?   Then I'll take it."
6, 106, "Scruffy", "Okay.  Murdolator's finished."
6, 106, "Bender", "I said I'd kill 'im myself!  Nobody listens to Bender!"
6, 106, "Leela", "We all have to share in the guilt.  Which is why we're each going to add one drop of cyanide to the death wheel as it goes by."
6, 106, "Scruffy", "Commence mercy-killing...  In three...  Two...  Ayup."
6, 106, "Hermes", "Kill-check one is go!"
6, 106, "Leela", "Yay!"
6, 106, "Amy", "Woohoo!"
6, 106, "Fry", "Kill-check two is go!"
6, 106, "Humans", "Ooh!"
6, 106, "Woman", "Wow!"
6, 106, "Hattie", "It's about time."
6, 106, "Female voice", "Vegetables activated."
6, 106, "Bender", "Kill-check three is go! Also, the salad's ready."
6, 106, "Leela", "Yay, salad!"
6, 106, "Amy", "Yay!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "What the hell are you doing?!"
6, 106, "Leela", "Zoidberg!   We know about your secret agreement.  I am so, so sorry for how we treated you."
6, 106, "Fry", "And, to make it up to you, we're killing the Professor for you so he doesn't die horribly from hypermalaria."
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "'E doesn't have hypermalaria, you idiots!  'E has Yetiism.  When 'e saved my life all those years ago, 'e was scratched by a Yeti!"
6, 106, "Fry", "Hmmm. I consider myself almost completely ignorant of modern medicine.  And I've never heard of Yetiism."
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "It mimics the symptoms of hypermalaria exactly.  Except for the part where, instead of dying, you turn into a Yeti!  Wow!  Hold 'im down while I prepare the antidote."
6, 106, "Leela", "Another Yeti?!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Yes.  The same jerk that once noshed on me like a shrimp toast.  Now, who's getting 'is pineal gland extracted?  Ah, yes.  This contains a concentrated form of the Yeti neurotoxin."
6, 106, "Hermes", "But that's what gave 'im Yetiism in the first place! Won't it just make 'im a double Yeti?!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Don't lecture me about Alien physiology, Conrad! The pineal neurotoxin neutralises the adrenal neurotoxin. That's why Yetis don't drive themselves mad!"
6, 106, "Fry", "My God. He's like some kinda believable Hulk!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "No time for an injection.  Uh!   I'll be damned. It did make 'im a double Yeti!"
6, 106, "Amy", "It wasn't supposed to do any of those things."
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "You did it, Johnny. I'm cured!"
6, 106, "Bender", "Wow!  Alright, let's set it up and try again."
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "There's one thing I don't understand, Zoidberg.  How did you persuade Mom to give you her precious Yeti head? Did you 'ave to promise anything in return?"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Nothing. Nothing at all."
6, 106, "Amy", "This calls for a celebration! Come on, everyone!  Let's go tanning!"
6, 106, "Bender", "Hooray!"
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "Yay!"
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "I was going to tan...  Once."
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth", "What do you say, Johnny?  It's on me."
6, 106, "Zoidberg", "Thank you, Hubert."
6, 106, "Professor Farnsworth and Zoidberg", "Woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop."
6, 107, "Hermes", "Listen up, people."
6, 107, "Hermes", "As long as nothing happens for the next fifteen minutes, our insurance will be reinstated, so let's just sit quietly and run out the clock."
6, 107, "Amy", "A giant sausage!"
6, 107, "Bender", "Oh, God!"
6, 107, "Hermes", "Oh, God, no! Get out of here, you horrific sausage!"
6, 107, "Leela", "Wait! Isn't today the parade? It's just a giant balloon!"
6, 107, "Fry", "Giant balloon?"
6, 107, "Bender", "See, buddy? It's not so scary."
6, 107, "Fry", "I feel better now.  Why is so many different parades smooshed together?"
6, 107, "Leela", "It's the Parade Day parade."
6, 107, "Fry", "What's Parade Day?"
6, 107, "Professor Farnsworth", "It used to be that every group in New New York wanted their own parade. Why, when I was a boy, we had a parade every day. Those were dark times."
6, 107, "Leela", "Now we just combine them all into one big Parade Day parade and get it over with."
6, 107, "Zoidberg", "Hey, look! A fog is rolling in."
6, 107, "Hermes", "No, that's just the Jamaican pride float."
6, 107, "Amy", "Looks like it's speeding up."
6, 107, "Hermes", "Oh, no! It's within munching distance of the Doritos float."
6, 107, "Zapp", "Thank you! Thank you!  Kif, you're slacking off of my waving arm."
6, 107, "Leela", "Oh, no! It's heading right for those two nerds!"
6, 107, "Manbot", "Whoa! Sweet shirt, dude!"
6, 107, "Man", "Thanks. I have another one that says PALEONTOLOGISTS DO IT IN THE DIRT. I'm a palaeontologist."
6, 107, "Fry", "I'll save one of you!"
6, 107, "Woman", "Oh, honey! I dig you so much!  Thank you for saving my stupidly dressed husband.  You're a hero!"
6, 107, "Mayor Poopenmeyer", "A hero indeed. What's your name, son?"
6, 107, "Fry", "I dunno. Fry?"
6, 107, "Mayor Poopenmeyer", "Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud to associate myself with a true hero.  Mr. Fry, allow me to present you with the keys to the city.  This one's for the deadbolt, this is for the top lock... I think this one's for the knob. The city's in a bad neighbourhood.  Care to say a few words, son?"
6, 107, "Fry", "Uh... Heroes don't do drugs! Except for Drugman, I guess."
6, 107, "Mayor Poopenmeyer", "I hereby declare that henceforth this Saturday shall be known as Fry-day!"
6, 107, "Fry", "It sure was nice of the Mayor's wife to have sex with me.  Huh?"
6, 107, "Bender", "You!"
6, 107, "Fry", "What?"
6, 107, "Bender", "You could've saved the Robot, but instead you saved the Human.  Do you think Human life is more precious than Robot life?"
6, 107, "Fry", "No, no... Well, yes, actually."
6, 107, "Bender", "That's it. I'm killin' myself!"
6, 107, "Leela", "Oh, Lord."
6, 107, "Bender", "Don't try and talk me out of it!  Well?"
6, 107, "Amy", "Bender, you always say you're gonna kill yourself, but you almost never do."
6, 107, "Hermes", "Yeah. Last time you went to the suicide booth, you ended up dating it for six months."
6, 107, "Leela", "How is Lynn, by the way?"
6, 107, "Bender", "Livin' in Oregon with her crazy mother! See you at my funeral, suckers!"
6, 107, "Bender", "Kill me, please!  And make it splatter!"
6, 107, "Suicide booth", "With pleasure... Bender!"
6, 107, "Bender", "Lynn?  Huh, wow, you look great.  Fat, but great. I thought you were in Oregon."
6, 107, "Suicide booth", "My mom tried to commit suicide in me. I don't wanna talk about it."
6, 107, "Bender", "Well, tell your mom I said hello and it's been nice catchin' up with you. Let's get this show on the road!"
6, 107, "Suicide booth", "Oh, no! You're going to die, alright. But it won't be suicide. It'll be murder!"
6, 107, "Bender", "Missed me!"
6, 107, "Fry", "He did it.  He actually did it this time."
6, 107, "Hermes", "No way, mon. He's fakin' it.  He really is gone.  Everyone, put on your takin'-off caps."
6, 107, "Fry", "Our what?"
6, 107, "Professor Farnsworth", "It's a sign of respect, you savage!"
6, 107, "Amy", "Poor, nasty, mean, old Bender. I can't believe we'll never hear his evil laugh again."
6, 107, "Fry", "I miss 'im so much."
6, 107, "Hermes", "There, there, Fry. He may be gone, but he'll always be with us as a trash can."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Look at that loser gettin' garbage dumped in 'im. Glad I'm not him, whoever he is."
6, 107, "Leela", "Fry, as his only friend, you should have first pick of body parts."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Just don't pick his nose!  What's wrong with you guys? This is comedy gold!"
6, 107, "Fry", "He always had my back, so I'll take his arm, uh... As a backscratcher.  I love you, Bender. Somebody hand me a bolt cutter."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Hey, dipshlits! That's not me. I'm right here. Hello!  Pay attention to me!"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Why can't anybody hear my witty remarks? This is Hell!"
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "Feh! You wish!"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Robot Devil? You can hear me? Why is everyone else ignoring me?"
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "Isn't it obvious, Bender?"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Yeah, I guess it is."
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "You're dead!"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "What?! I thought I just had laryngitis and anti-gravity."
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "Come down to my office and I'll explain everything."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "So what's happenin' to me? And I'll take my answer in any form but a song!"
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "Oh, you're no fun.  You see, Bender, it's simple. You're a ghost!"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "A g-g-g-g-ghost?!"
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "No, just the regular kind.  Because you killed yourself, you're in Limbo. Your software was exported to the computational cloud."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Adoy! Wait, Adoy?"
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "Your disembodied programme is now running on the wireless network shared by all machinery."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Cut to the chase, Smokey! How do I get outta Limbo?"
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "That's the laughy part! You can't! You're stuck in an infinite loop."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "An infinite loop?  I don't have time for that. Man, this is all Fry's fault!"
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "Fry? I hate that guy. We once traded hands.  They still stink of candy corn!"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Get this"
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "What?!  After all you've done for him, Fry must die."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "I know, right? I'd murder him good if only I was still alive."
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "Bender, would you like to make a deal?"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "I'm not stupid...  So yes, absolutely.  What have I agreed to?"
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "I'll return you to your body... After you use your ghostly powers to scare Fry to death!"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "That sounds fair and also fun. I like that there's no catch this time."
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "But wait. There's a catch."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Crap!"
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "If you fail, you'll spend eternity here in Robot Hell. Which, as luck would have it, is where I rehearse my band.  Hit it, boys!   Cigars are evil. You won't miss 'em—"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Okay! I'll do it, I'll do it. Just stop the damn music!"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Scare Fry to death? Ha. I could do that in my sleep.  What are you, deaf?"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Soap. I know Fry's afraid of that.  Maybe he'll die if I rub 'im all over with it real slow.  Whoa, it's sick! My software can control electronics."
6, 107, "Fry", "What the—  No! Not the armpits! Winter's coming!"
6, 107, "Hermes", "As you can see, since Bender's death, requests to bite one's shiny metal ass are down 98%.  Do you mind doing that later?!"
6, 107, "Scruffy", "Bite my shiny metal ass."
6, 107, "Fry", "Help! I was attacked in my bathroom! By my bathroom! I'm being haunted by a ghost!"
6, 107, "Amy", "Fry... You're just upset because you drove Bender to suicide. Here, take your mind off it with these soothing relaxation balls."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Alright. I got 'im all heebie-jeebied with my bathroom harass.  One more good scare and I'll be outta Limbo!"
6, 107, "Hermes", "Did someone say Limbo?"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Hold on to your dookie. It's about to get spooky."
6, 107, "Fry", "I'm tellin' ya. Somethin' supernatural is happening. I'm scared to death!"
6, 107, "Leela", "Stop being ridiculous. There's no such thing as whatever you're saying."
6, 107, "Fry", "Ow! Ow! Ow!"
6, 107, "Leela", "Whoa. Maybe you're right. I only meant to slap you twice."
6, 107, "Fry", "All I know is I've got a ghost that needs busting."
6, 107, "Hermes", "Who you gonna call?"
6, 107, "Fry", "Gho—"
6, 107, "Female voice", "The number you have dialled has been lame since 1989."
6, 107, "Fry", "Now do you believe me?!"
6, 107, "Professor Farnsworth", "Oh, fuff.  Enough of your superstitious nonsense. I'm sure that whatever is happening can be explained by science."
6, 107, "Gypsy", "Let the séance begin!"
6, 107, "Professor Farnsworth", "I said science!"
6, 107, "Gypsy", "The veil is lifting. I am gazing into the spirit world... And... Nothing.  You said something about a buffet?"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "I'm right here, you lazy shyster!"
6, 107, "Gypsy", "Wait. I'm sensing something."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "I'm rich!  Aw."
6, 107, "Fry", "Is it a ghost?!"
6, 107, "Gypsy", "There's no such thing as ghosts, you donkey monkey! It's a Robot ghost."
6, 107, "Fry", "A Robot ghost?! What Robot would wanna haunt me?"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Me, dumbass! Bender, Bender, Bender, Bender!  Aw!  Tell 'im, you baggy, old crone!"
6, 107, "Professor Farnsworth", "Finally! Any more ridiculous ideas?"
6, 107, "Reverend Preacherbot", "Hallelujah!  I'm here to conduct a exorcism and avail myself of the buffet.  Can I get an amen and a goodly helpin' of Scruffy's famous corn biscuits?"
6, 107, "Scruffy", "Right away, Reverend."
6, 107, "Reverend Preacherbot", "Oh, Lord. I got the too much macaroni sweats. Now where's this alleged apparition?  Might be a problem with your circuit breaker. See ya."
6, 107, "Fry", "Please! I'm under constant attack by machinery. I can't sleep, I can't think. I can't even think!"
6, 107, "Reverend Preacherbot", "Very well.  This sacramental firewall scans for and removes ghostware in a twenty-foot radius."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Bring it on, holy man!"
6, 107, "Reverend Preacherbot", "Carry this at all times and the demon cannot harm you. It also keeps cats off the sofa. By killin' 'em!"
6, 107, "Fry", "So quiet! So peaceful! Time to lower my guard even for a minute.  A heart attack!  Yup, I was right."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Okay, Beelze. Fry's dead."
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "A ghost!  Oh, it's you."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "A deal's a deal, so give me my body back."
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "Fry's dead, you say? Funny. That's not what it says on his Wikipedia page."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Survived the heart attack?! Damn you, Obamacare!"
6, 107, "Dr. Cahill", "I'm afraid your heart has suffered a lot of damage, Mr. Fry. And my cleavage isn't helping."
6, 107, "Professor Farnsworth", "Not helping him."
6, 107, "Dr. Cahill", "One more sudden shock will kill you."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Sudden? That's just the kind of one more shock I was plannin'."
6, 107, "Fry", "The machines. They're after me!"
6, 107, "Dr. Cahill", "You're suffering from machine phobia. Your only hope is to go to the Amish homeworld, where no machines are allowed."
6, 107, "Fry", "I guess it's for the best.  The only machine I'll ever miss is...  Bender."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Say what?"
6, 107, "Fry", "Now that he's gone, I realise how valuable a Robot life can be... When it belongs to my best friend."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "That's the closest thing to Bender is great that anyone besides me has ever said."
6, 107, "Female voice", "Final boarding call for Flight 38 to the Amish homeworld. As a reminder, passengers are limited to two carry-on butter churns."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "I'm sorry, Fry. I'm sorry! Wait for your ghost buddy!"
6, 107, "Amish man", "Brother Fry, thou hast visitors."
6, 107, "Fry", "Well, yank my beard. This be a surprise."
6, 107, "Leela", "How are you, Fry?"
6, 107, "Fry", "Thank you for asking, English. My life is simple, but plain. And, though Bender be gone, somehow, I feel he's still with me."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "I sure am, Brother Fry.  Yo, big bonnet! Move your ugly but modest head covering. Oh, right. You can't hear me."
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "Oh, I hear you loud and clear."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "You're not Granny Hester! What have you done with Granny Hester?!"
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "She's naked, but unharmed. And now, Bender, it's time to fulfil your end of the deal."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Sorry. I'm not gonna kill Fry. Take me to Hell for all eternity. Just as long as my little bearded meatbag gets to live."
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "That he will not! For, you see, it is your fate to kill him."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Says you!  I would never kill Fry! Not even to save my own life!"
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "But, Bender, isn't a Robot life worth ever so much more than a Human life?"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Of course not! What idiot thinks that?!"
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "You!"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "You're usin' my own words against me!  Go to Hell!"
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "Soon enough. But, first, the killing. Have you noticed that animals are sometimes spooked by Robot ghosts?"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "So what?! I hate animals!  Run for your life, Fry! Move your hemp flaps!"
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "He can't hear you, Bender. I'm afraid your friend is about to be Fully Buckminstered!"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Oh, yeah? I'll just jump into a machine and get his attention that way."
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "Ah, but there aren't any machines on this planet!"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "There's one, you rusty, old dummy."
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "Hey, no fair! Ocupado!"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Got you! Get over here, Devil!"
6, 107, "Fry", "And Scruffy's buffet? How's that going?"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Fry! Fry! Look out for that bowlin' barn!"
6, 107, "Fry", "Bender?! Is that thou?"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "I love you!"
6, 107, "Amy", "Oh, my God! That was close!"
6, 107, "Hermes", "Did you see that?"
6, 107, "Leela", "Are you okay? What just happened?"
6, 107, "Fry", "Well, I think the Robot Devil said he'd loved me in Bender's voice, wearing Granny Hester's clothes. I wanna go home!"
6, 107, "Robot Devil's ghost", "You still lose, Bender. You failed to kill Fry, so you are banished to Hell.  I get a new body and you get to be a translucid chump 'til the end of time!"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Big deal! I saved my friend. As far as I'm concerned, I won."
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "Uh, really?   You may find your victory pyrrhic, when subjected to this lyric, for a trillion years or so. Yeah!"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Whoa!"
6, 107, "Robot Devil", "Hey, where are you going?!"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "I don't know and I don't care!"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Yeah, I'm back!  Wait. This is my stop!  Oh, this guy..."
6, 107, "White Robot", "Bender, for your selfless act in saving Fry, I am pleased to welcome you to Robot Heaven."
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "Shut up, God!"
6, 107, "White Robot", "Beg pardon?"
6, 107, "Bender's ghost", "I wanna go back to Robot Earth. I mean regular Earth."
6, 107, "White Robot", "Hey, what are you—  Ow! Hey, stop that! I command you, you jerk!  Just get out."
6, 107, "Fry", "Woo! I've been through the adventure of a lifetime.  Ow!"
6, 107, "Bender", "I'm back, baby!"
6, 107, "Fry", "You're back from the dead?!"
6, 107, "Bender", "I'm back from lots of stuff."
6, 107, "Fry", "Oh, Bender, Bender, I missed you so much!  Hey, wait. Did you haunt me?"
6, 108, "Hermes", "Well, we're bankrupt in six, five..."
6, 108, "Hermes", "Four, three..."
6, 108, "Hermes", "Two, one. And we're out of business."
6, 108, "Professor Farnsworth", "Good news! We're back in business. We've been hired to deliver an envelope."
6, 108, "Leela", "It's crunch time. Let's do this.  It's for you, Professor."
6, 108, "Professor Farnsworth", "Great delivery, everyone. You're the finest crew I've had the honour to work with.  Oh, my. We're being foreclosed upon. You're all terrible and incompetent!"
6, 108, "Amy", "I resent that!"
6, 108, "Hermes", "Wait. I found a loophole in the mortgage. If we actually pay it, we can keep the building. We just need...  Eleven million dollars."
6, 108, "Bender", "And... Boned!"
6, 108, "Professor Farnsworth", "Aw. I suppose there's nothing left to do but move out. Leela, Amy, pack us a lunch for our new lives under the bridge while us men reminisce and smoke some stogies."
6, 108, "Leela", "We are not packing lunches, you walking beer commercials. It was you men who drove this company into the ground. Remember Fry's idea to offer free delivery?"
6, 108, "Fry", "It got us a lot of customers!"
6, 108, "Leela", "We're a delivery company!"
6, 108, "Amy", "If you wanna save this company, you should listen to a woman's idea for once."
6, 108, "Hermes", "Okay. What you got?"
6, 108, "Leela", "An airline!"
6, 108, "Amy", "Yeah! Wait, what?"
6, 108, "Leela", "We should become a commercial airline. I mean, we've got a ship, and teleporters won't be invented for another fifteen years, according to that guy from the future."
6, 108, "Amy", "Wow! That's actually a really good idea for a woman!"
6, 108, "Professor Farnsworth", "Puff! What else you ladies got?"
6, 108, "Bender", "Girls-of-Planet-Express calendar!"
6, 108, "Fry", "Girly calendar? Great idea, Amy!"
6, 108, "Hermes", "Okay, then. Leela, Amy, come to work topless tomorrow."
6, 108, "Leela", "Forget it! I promised myself I wouldn't pose naked until I was married."
6, 108, "Hermes", "Sorry. It's in your contract. ""All female employees must pose nude if requested."""
6, 108, "Leela", "That's discriminatory!"
6, 108, "Hermes", "No, it's in all our contracts. Here's mine. ""All female employees must pose nude if requested."""
6, 108, "Fry", "Sounds fun."
6, 108, "Bender", "Back to work, Hermes!"
6, 108, "Scruffy", "Now that's what I call fine print."
6, 108, "Amy", "Okay, but good luck making a girly calendar with only two female employees."
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "Oh, husband! I'm so excited about this new job."
6, 108, "Hermes", "And it's excited about you, LaBarbara. First order of business is to put on your uniform and take your ID photo."
6, 108, "Leela", "Look, I agree that it makes space walking more comfortable, but, for a photo shoot, it's a little... Unsavoury. Over."
6, 108, "Bender", "Time is money, peaches. Now shut your com link and make love to the camera. And remember"
6, 108, "Leela", "But the ship is dirty."
6, 108, "Bender", "Uh, whatever. I ran out of film an hour ago."
6, 108, "Professor Farnsworth", "No, no. This won't do. A three-month calendar? What is this, Mercury?"
6, 108, "Amy", "I told you it wouldn't work."
6, 108, "Professor Farnsworth", "Well, you should've talked louder. Fortunately, I came up with a brilliant idea to save Planet Express. We'll turn it into a commercial airline!"
6, 108, "Leela", "But that was my idea!"
6, 108, "Professor Farnsworth", "Then you should've talked louder.  What?"
6, 108, "Leela", "There. It was hard work, but it beats posing in demeaning, skimpy modelling outfits."
6, 108, "Professor Farnsworth", "Ladies, here are your demeaning, skimpy stewardess outfits."
6, 108, "Bender", "Sorry, ma'am. I'll have to confiscate your artificial knee cap."
6, 108, "Hattie", "Okay, here you go."
6, 108, "Fry", "Ladies and gentlemen, this is the plane's president speaking."
6, 108, "Fry", "We are cleared for takeoff."
6, 108, "Leela", "You put Goofus and Ganja in charge? I'm the only trained pilot here."
6, 108, "Professor Farnsworth", "Please, Leela. Who ever heard of a plane with a woman president?"
6, 108, "Bender", "Welcome to Plan Am Flight 1 to Acapulsar. The local time on Acapulsar is five years from now.  In the event of a wormhole sendin' us back in time, do not kill your parents. If you who are travelling with small children, help them not to kill you before not killin' your own parents. Now please turn off all electronic devices."
6, 108, "Fry", "Uh, preparing for takeoff."
6, 108, "Man", "I kill you, my friend!"
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "I hope you all enjoyed our timey beverage service.  Now sit back and endure our in-flight entertainment."
6, 108, "Zoidberg", "Hiya! Hiya! Hiya!  So what's the deal with airline food, hmm? They offer you two choices, but they're always outta one. Uh, by the way, we're outta both choices."
6, 108, "Petunia", "Shut up and put on four episodes of Da Office."
6, 108, "Amana", "Ooh, your hands are warm...  For a Robot."
6, 108, "Bender", "Thanks, baby. I don't know what you're doing back here in the galley, 'cause you got a first-class C."
6, 108, "Leela", "Captain, we were supposed to land two days ago. Is everything— Hey!"
6, 108, "Fry", "Are we at the fair yet, Mommy?"
6, 108, "Leela", "We're not at the any place! And we're out of fuel!"
6, 108, "Amy", "Attention, passengers. Please remain seated until the plane comes to a complete crash."
6, 108, "Professor Farnsworth", "Perhaps we should reconsider the girly calendar."
6, 108, "Leela", "Flight-attendance log. We've crashed near a river of mercury on a lifeless, mineral world. Supplies are low. Cannibalism, imminent. Radio, busted. Our one hope is to form a society."
6, 108, "Hermes", "Okay, then. Men, let's get hunting. The women folk can cook what we catch."
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "No one put you in charge, husband. I'm the only one here who ever ran a society."
6, 108, "Hermes", "Roller derby is not a society!"
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "Well, let's put it to a vote, then. All in favour of the jamooca thunderclap?  That would be me."
6, 108, "Hermes", "Practically no one. All in favour of me?"
6, 108, "Dr. Cahill", "Eight to eight. It's a tie."
6, 108, "Professor Farnsworth", "We can't trust a woman's math! Count again!"
6, 108, "Big rock Alien", "Greetings, soft ones. Who among you is your leader?"
6, 108, "Men", "He is!"
6, 108, "Women", "She is!"
6, 108, "Big rock Alien", "Curious. You're a diarchic society?"
6, 108, "Hermes", "Um, maybe. But, whatever we are, I'm the leader of it."
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "Leader? Fat man, you couldn't even run a bath."
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "Well, you sure can run something"
6, 108, "Big rock Alien", "Silence! Even a young pebble could see your race is divided based on the configuration of your twenty-third chromosome."
6, 108, "Amy", "You mean, ""along gender lines""?"
6, 108, "Big rock Alien", "Gender?"
6, 108, "Sal", "Yes. You knows, guyses, galses... In that order.  Ows!"
6, 108, "Big rock Alien", "I am not familiar with this concept of gender. My species has only a single gender, known as nuchacho."
6, 108, "Zoidberg", "Interesting.  Come on, men! Let's kill him!"
6, 108, "Big rock Alien", "Your genders differ in many ways, but, as with all things that are different, chocolate and vanilla, Mac and PC, one is always clearly better."
6, 108, "Bender", "Chocolate, Mac, men. The end."
6, 108, "Big rock Alien", "Well, I've got nothing to do for the next eight million years. Therefore, I will administer a series of tests to determine the superior gender. Test number one"
6, 108, "Professor Farnsworth", "Just ask us some damn questions."
6, 108, "Big rock Alien", "Very well. Which is larger? An Italian size four or an American apparel medium?  How many calories are in a small green-tea yogurt.  Name any twelve of the Desperate Housewives.  How was your day?  Test complete. What is the score?"
6, 108, "Bender", "Uh... Men, five. Women, less."
6, 108, "Amana", "Hey! He's lying."
6, 108, "Big rock Alien", "Obviously. That was a test to see who could lie better. The men win that round."
6, 108, "Professor Farnsworth", "In your face, decumbent urinators."
6, 108, "Big rock Alien", "So far, I have learned nothing, but that's probably as much my fault as yours.  The time has come for the final test."
6, 108, "Fry", "Uh, we usually call it the lightning round."
6, 108, "Big rock Alien", "As you may have noticed, it's getting hotter here."
6, 108, "Leela", "It's nice."
6, 108, "Fry", "It's too hot."
6, 108, "Zoidberg", "Would one of you chicks change the thermostat?"
6, 108, "Big rock Alien", "Tomorrow morning, this planet makes its closest pass to the sun. You will all be boiled alive like retired circus animals. Unless you somehow can cross the Great Alkali Plains and reach shelter in the Cave of Harmony."
6, 108, "Fry", "That sounds hard."
6, 108, "Big rock Alien", "Which ever gender reaches the cave will survive and may the inferior gender burst into something. Flames, I guess."
6, 108, "Hermes", "Uh-oh. I think we're walking in circles. I recognise the pattern of striations on that gypsum formation."
6, 108, "Fry", "Also, my shoe that fell off."
6, 108, "Bender", "Oh, God. We're all gonna die in agony."
6, 108, "Small rock Alien", "Howdy there. You fellows need some directions?"
6, 108, "Bender", "No, we're fine."
6, 108, "Professor Farnsworth", "Beat it."
6, 108, "Fry", "Don't worry about it."
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "Keep it up, sistren. Only a few more miles to the cave. Let's just buckle down and—"
6, 108, "Amy", "Look! A clearance sale!"
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "What?! Where?"
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "I can't believe that sale was just a mirage. Now we're going to die without so much as a factory second-clutch purse to show for it."
6, 108, "Amy", "It would've been nice to shop at Tommy Hilfiger one last time."
6, 108, "Hattie", "It wasn't Tommy Hilfi-gigger. It was Linens 'n Things!"
6, 108, "Petunia", "The hell it was! It was a Juicy Couture!"
6, 108, "Leela", "I guess we all saw what we wanted to see."
6, 108, "Hermes", "We can't make it tonight. We'll set up camp here by this shoe."
6, 108, "Professor Farnsworth", "Oh, gentlemen. When that sun rises in the morning, we're toast. These are our last moments together. So, if anyone's got any good fart jokes, now would be the time."
6, 108, "Amy", "It's a schmundered degrees and all we have to drink are non-diet sodas."
6, 108, "Petunia", "It's gonna ruin ma figger."
6, 108, "Leela", "Wait. I forgot that Amana here is a refrigerator. If we could supercharge her freon with a gas compressor, we might survive the heat and make it to the cave."
6, 108, "Amana", "Hey, yeah! But the only gas compressor on this planet is inside Bender's ass."
6, 108, "Dr. Cahill", "Was that a fart joke? Because I don't find those amusing."
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "No one does! Nevertheless, Bender's gas blaster may be our only hope."
6, 108, "Hermes", "Oh! Wife? What are you doin' with Bender's shiny metal, gas compressor?"
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "None of your Biz Markie. Wait a second. What's that do wah in your ditty bag?"
6, 108, "Hermes", "Okay... So we were hot. I stole Amana's freon coil so we could hook it up to Bender's ass and build a cooler."
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "You are no better than me, ya shifty tree skink! How do you live with yourself?"
6, 108, "Hermes", "Damn it, woman! You are makin' me highly Selassie."
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "Don't you talk to me that way, you big, hairy Belafonte!"
6, 108, "Hermes", "Oh... You cookin' me back bacon. Thank you, woman."
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "That's not back bacon! That's your back bakin'!"
6, 108, "Hermes", "Oh, no! We overslept."
6, 108, "Amy", "The mercury's boiling!"
6, 108, "Petunia", "Can't breathe... Lungs burnin'..."
6, 108, "Fry", "My lucky shoe!"
6, 108, "Bender", "Goodbye, cruel me!  I learned that from a movie."
6, 108, "Big rock Alien", "I find both genders supremely disappointing. The real reason I administered this bizarre, outer-space test was to teach you to work together! But you couldn't. Thanks to you, I lost my bet with the Borax Kid."
6, 108, "Fry", "Never bet against me being stupid."
6, 108, "Big rock Alien", "Enough! Your gender differences have kept you from achieving harmony. There is only one way to resolve this conflict."
6, 108, "Fry", "Wait. Why didn't that hurt?  My wing-wang's gone!"
6, 108, "Leela", "My girls!"
6, 108, "Bender", "My antenna!"
6, 108, "Hattie", "My kajigger!"
6, 108, "Zoidberg", "My gonopores! Look it up."
6, 108, "Big rock Alien", "I have freed you from the tyranny of gender. Now go in peace. Or actually stay here. I'll go in peace."
6, 108, "Professor Farnsworth", "Good news, nuchachos! The ship is nearly repaired."
6, 108, "Sal", "Work goes fasters withouts no secondary sex characteristicses at which to hoot. Now who wants to sing some Christopher Cross songs?"
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "I do!"
6, 108, "Fry", "Look, associates. I made a hammock from our clothing."
6, 108, "Leela", "How industrious!"
6, 108, "Amy", "Do you mind if we sleep with you?"
6, 108, "Fry", "I have no opinion.  Well, good night."
6, 108, "Hermes", "Everyone got along so well today."
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "Yes. This place is like a neutered utopia.  A neutopia!"
6, 108, "Hermes", "I enjoy humour when no one gets hurt."
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "Your companionship is inoffensive, Hermes."
6, 108, "Hermes", "Likewise. Really, what are we missing out on by not having sex right now?"
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "Well..."
6, 108, "Hermes", "Give us back our genitals!"
6, 108, "Big rock Alien", "Is that you, Borax Kid? I've got your fifty bucks.  Oh, it's you. Why do you want your genders? You seem happier without them."
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "Bein' Human isn't just about bein' happy! It's about lovin' and fightin' and that rasta MacNasty we were doin' last night.  We want that back."
6, 108, "Big rock Alien", "Very well. Perhaps it is I who have learned a lesson. Or something."
6, 108, "Bender", "Now what?"
6, 108, "Big rock Alien", "I have decided, after little thought, to return your genders."
6, 108, "Amy", "Not cool, bro! Our genders are all reversed!"
6, 108, "Hattie", "Now I got a what-ya-call-it instead of a kajigger, you stupid what-ya-call-it!"
6, 108, "Big rock Alien", "Okay. Stop yelling at me! It was an innocent mistake. Allow me to rectify it."
6, 108, "Zapp", "I got your distress call and came as quickly as I wanted to. No need to thank me."
6, 108, "Leela", "What's your problem, Holmes? Now we'll be stuck like this forever!"
6, 108, "Zapp", "Chill out, dude.  Well, hello from the neck down."
6, 108, "Bender", "Thank you for your patronage. We know you have a choice in airlines and you made the wrong one. No refunds!"
6, 108, "Hermes", "Aren't we going to cuddle?"
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "Woman, I'm tired! I'm sorry. It's just... I need my sleep. I got to get up five times a night to play Xbox."
6, 108, "Hermes", "I understand. Womanhood also takes some getting used to. For example, did you know there are more than two feelin's?"
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "I only need one feelin'"
6, 108, "Hermes", "Your manwich!"
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "No wonder it's such a mess in there. These bad boys are hard to aim."
6, 108, "Leela", "I hate being a man. I smell bad, my face is scratchy, and the food at those strip clubs is terrible."
6, 108, "Amy", "Crappin' A! Still, I'm sure the women are having an even harder time."
6, 108, "Bender", "OMG! Being chicks is so much fun."
6, 108, "Fry", "Now, when I say stupid things, guys all laugh and buy me stuff."
6, 108, "Leela", "What a skank. Anyway, Planet Express is still facing foreclosure. There's no way we can raise enough money to save this company."
6, 108, "Amy", "Wait. What about the girly calendar?"
6, 108, "Fry", "Well, that won't work, remember? We only have three women on staff—"
6, 108, "LaBarbara", """All female employees must pose nude if requested."""
6, 108, "Leela", "And it is requested."
6, 108, "Professor Farnsworth", "Let's just hope we can sell enough of these calendars by tomorrow."
6, 108, "Professor Farnsworth", "We sold enough of those calendars since yesterday!"
6, 108, "Leela", "Thank God most of our fans are huge perverts!"
6, 108, "Fry", "Who're you, stranger?"
6, 108, "Borax Kid", "Well, madam, folks called me the Borax Kid. My friend, the other rock Alien, died without settin' your genitals to right, so I reckon it's up to me to sex you up proper."
6, 108, "Leela", "My girls are back!"
6, 108, "Fry", "Ow! Yay!"
6, 108, "Hermes", "So what did you like better, my love? Bein' a man or a woman?"
6, 108, "LaBarbara", "I don't care what parts I have. As long as they interlock with yours."
6, 108, "Professor Farnsworth", "Ah, marriage. It combines the contentedness of being neutered with the occasional sex of being not."
6, 108, "Borax Kid", "Well, I'd best mosey on down to the landing. Sounds like the feldspar queen is about to set sail. You folks watch your genitals now.  Come on, boy! Giddy up!"
6, 108, "Leela", "And that's that."
6, 108, "Scruffy", "What I miss?"
6, 109, "Albert", "I got one!"
6, 109, "Warden Vogel", "Okay, kids. Put away the dust motes 'til tomorrow.  It's story time!  Today's storyteller is a space captain who grew up right here at the Orphanarium. Welcome back the bedwetter of building D, Turanga Leela!"
6, 109, "Leela", "Hi, kids!  What book would you like me to read first?"
6, 109, "Albert", "We don't got books no more."
6, 109, "Leela", "What?"
6, 109, "Warden Vogel", "He means any more. Look, sometimes you gotta choose between eatin' and reading.  So they ate the books. Just... Make somethin' up!"
6, 109, "Leela", "Make something up? Um... Okay.  Once upon a time, there was a... A..."
6, 109, "Sally", "Princess?"
6, 109, "Leela", "Yes! That!  A... One-eyed princess in a long, flowing... Tank top. And she lived in a magical, one-room..."
6, 109, "Sally", "Castle?"
6, 109, "Leela", "Yeah. If you believe the listing agent. Anyhow, one day, the princess went off to... Uh... Tell a story! And, then, that's exactly what she did do that. And they all lived happily ever after. The end."
6, 109, "Albert", "Miss Leela? I have a question!"
6, 109, "Leela", "Yes, Albert?"
6, 109, "Albert", "That story was bad."
6, 109, "Leela", "That's not really a question."
6, 109, "Albert", "That wasn't really a story."
6, 109, "Leela", "I'm sorry, kids. I'm not a natural storyteller.   But I promise"
6, 109, "Sally", "Please don't..."
6, 109, "Leela", "See you soon!"
6, 109, "Leela", "I'm sure I've got a great kids' story in me. I just need to think of three of some kind of animal. Concentrate, Leela! Concentrate!   Fry, I'm writing here! Do you have to play that?"
6, 109, "Fry", "Yes.  It's the only song I know."
6, 109, "Zoidberg", "Look, friends! I accidentally learned to tap-dance!"
6, 109, "Leela", "Zoidberg, I'm trying to—"
6, 109, "Hermes", "Time for my four-twenty-one daiquiri!"
6, 109, "Bender", "Guys! Guys! Guess who just got commissioned as a tugboat!"
6, 109, "Amy", "Oh, yeah! Pachinko break!"
6, 109, "Pachinko machine", "Tokyo crazy balls! Yes!"
6, 109, "Professor Farnsworth", "Ooh, good, Leela. You're here.  I'd like to describe my foot pain.  My left has a sharp jabbing throb near the bunion, while the other's got a searing pain like gout.  Maybe it's too much albumin because of gravity..."
6, 109, "Leela", "Even if I had a pen, I couldn't write under these conditions.  I'm going to some other planet, where I can concentrate."
6, 109, "Professor Farnsworth", "Searing, searing pain that feels as if it were in a vice."
6, 109, "Bender", "Well, that was rude."
6, 109, "Leela", "Warden Vogel, I have a new story for the children.  I'm sure they'll like it more than my last one."
6, 109, "Warden Vogel", "They liked hunger cramps more than your last one. Anyhow, you'll have to wait. The kids are busy right now."
6, 109, "Leela", "Oh. Is the organ-harvesting clown here?"
6, 109, "Warden Vogel", "Nah. Rusty comes on Tuesdays now. Today, it's the owner of the Tickelodeon Kids Network."
6, 109, "Abner Doubledeal", "Okay, kids.  Get ready to be subjected to our new Fall shows! Mr. Funny Bunny here will gauge your reaction by bombarding your brains with harmless snuggle rays."
6, 109, "Albert", "He gives me a nice, warm feeling in my eyeballs!"
6, 109, "Male voice #1", "Popular Slut Club."
6, 109, "Little girl #1", "Oh, my God!  There's Jake Thinkleburg!  He's so hot!  I wish he wasn't my brother."
6, 109, "Male voice #1", "Popular Slut Club."
6, 109, "Male voice #2", "Look! Up on the drive-through menu! It's Captain Mega Meat and his young ward Bottomless Boy!"
6, 109, "Bottomless Boy", "Hurry, Captain!  A skinny kid needs our help!"
6, 109, "Captain Mega Meat", "Supersize me!"
6, 109, "Male voice #3", "From the ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper daycare centre in Glasgow, Scotland, it's Extreme Toddler Wrestling!"
6, 109, "Abner Doubledeal", "Thanks for the brain scans, kids.  Don't have any children for the next couple of days."
6, 109, "Warden Vogel", "Alright, boys and girls. Enough fun! Your old friend Leela is back with a brand-new story!"
6, 109, "Leela", "Hi! It's great to be back.  I think you'll enjoy this one."
6, 109, "Sally", "Please!  Can't we just get our organs harvested?"
6, 109, "Leela", "It's about some cute, little creatures from a land called Rumbledy-Hump.  Kids, let's meet the Humplings!  My name is Lady Buggle and I huggle all my friends.  I'm a silly spring named Doingg and my bouncing never ends.  Doingg. Doingg. Doingg.  They call me Princess Num Num. I'm as sweet as sticky buns.  I'm Feffernoose.  Hello.  I'm scared of everyones. Oh, Feffernoose.  What about me?  Hey, it's Garbly. Everyone loves him 'cause they can't understand him. It's nice to meet you. We're here to make you laugh and think and smile and learn and sing.And laugh and learn and smile and think and other happy things."
6, 109, "Albert", "Say more things like that!"
6, 109, "Leela", "Okey-doke. One sunny, funny day, there was an unfamiliar visitor in Rumbledy-Hump."
6, 109, "Leela", "Today we learned that folks are not as different as they seem.  The space gorilla's just like us. Although I breathe chlorine."
6, 109, "Sally", "Wow! I can't believe you imaginated all that stuff!"
6, 109, "Nina", "Will you come back again and tell us more stories and also adopt us all?"
6, 109, "Leela", "Of course I'll tell you more stories.  I'll go think some up right now."
6, 109, "Abner Doubledeal", "Holy moly!  Lady, you don't know me, but my name is Abner Doubledeal."
6, 109, "Leela", "Wait! I know you! You're Abner Doubledeal!"
6, 109, "Abner Doubledeal", "I brain-scanned those little nose-pickers during your story. And, sister, their enjoyment glands were squirtin' like Broadway roadkill!"
6, 109, "Leela", "Aw.  They were?!"
6, 109, "Abner Doubledeal", "Say, you seem like a smart mark.  How'd you like to make it into a TV show? Sign here, 'round this... Uh...  Supercuts coupon."
6, 109, "Leela", "I dunno.  Don't I need a degree to write gibberish for toddlers?"
6, 109, "Nina", "Come on, Miss Leela!  Don't be a fraidy cat like Feffernoose!"
6, 109, "Leela", "Okay. I'll do it!  To show you kids you can succeed at anything.  If you just luck out hard enough."
6, 109, "Abner Doubledeal", "Welcome to the glamourous, big-money world of basic cable TV!   I'm gonna need that pen back."
6, 109, "Hermes", "Working on a real TV show is so exciting! I'm on a mostly natural high!"
6, 109, "Amy", "These costumes are gonna make it hard to go to the bathroom."
6, 109, "Fry", "I'm not havin' any problem."
6, 109, "Abner Doubledeal", "We're shooting in five minutes and this Leela broad hasn't even delivered a script yet! Sweet Zombie Jesus! Like it's not hard enough to make a freakin' TV show for under fifty bucks!  Damn it, I'll call you back, grandma. Nice of you to show up, toots. I mean that sincerely. It's just that I'm in show biz."
6, 109, "Leela", "Sorry. I went to my quiet place to write. Here's the script."
6, 109, "Abner Doubledeal", "Argh! You writers make me sick. Nice job on the script, though. Places, everyone.  Okay. Cheap lights. Off-brand camera. And non-union action!"
6, 109, "Fry", "I like ice cream. And I like lollipops. And I like you, Princess Num Num."
6, 109, "Amy", "Ew! I'm all licky-sticky!"
6, 109, "Fry", "I don't understand. When I like something, I lick it. Like this raccoon."
6, 109, "Leela", "Doingg! Don't lick things that don't wanna be licked."
6, 109, "Fry", "But how do I know what to lick and what not to lick?"
6, 109, "Leela", "It's very simple.  If it's alive, don't lick it."
6, 109, "Zoidberg", "Like a horse, a turtle, or a cricket."
6, 109, "Bender", "I like turtles."
6, 109, "Leela", "So, if you're not sure if it's alive or dead,Poke it with a stick and lick the stick instead."
6, 109, "Fry", "Now I get it!"
6, 109, "Zoidberg", "Ow!"
6, 109, "Leela", "Well, that's all for today. But, before we go, let's do everything we just did two more times."
6, 109, "Bender", "Leela, that was great! Even I have to admire the performance of me, Bender!"
6, 109, "Amy", "The show looks so cute. Kids'll love it! And it looks so cruddy, their ironic hipster parents will love it."
6, 109, "Leela", "Thanks, guys. But let's be realistic. We all know any TV show that's even slightly good gets cancelled. Sometimes, two or three times."
6, 109, "Abner Doubledeal", "Leela! Tomorrow's ratings just came in from the future. We're a hit!"
6, 109, "Leela", "What?! My show is a hit?!"
6, 109, "Abner Doubledeal", "What are you, deaf? It's gonna be bigger than SpongeBot SquareBolts!"
6, 109, "SpongeBot SquareBolts", "I interfere with pacemakers!"
6, 109, "Abner Doubledeal", "Baby, I hope you like drowning in caviar. 'Cause that is how you're gonna die!"
6, 109, "Calculon", "Welcome back to the Young People's Choice Awards. In a moment, the award for Outstanding Sext Message. But, first, the nominees for Best New Kids' Show are... Yo Gimme Gimme!, The Adventures of Pit-Bull and Scaredy Squirrel, Dora the Destroyer, and Rumbledy-Hump."
6, 109, "Fry", "I hope you win, Leela."
6, 109, "Leela", "Thanks, Fry. It's nice to have the support of viewers like you."
6, 109, "Fry", "I'm the star of the show."
6, 109, "Leela", "Shh!"
6, 109, "Calculon", "And the Slurmie for Best New Kids' Show goes to... Turanga Leela for Rumbledy-Hump!"
6, 109, "Female voice", "This is Turanga Leela's first nomination and second time in high heels."
6, 109, "Leela", "Wow. I feel so lucky just to have been nominated alongside so many inferior shows. And, to all my young friends at the Orphanarium, thank you for inspiring me to be your hero."
6, 109, "Calculon", "Slurm her!"
6, 109, "Bender", "So wait. You play a high-school student who's also secretly a rock star who's also secretly a massage chair?"
6, 109, "Fembot", "No. I play a high-school student who's also secretly a rock star, but, in real life, I'm a massage chair."
6, 109, "Bender", "Hmmm. You ever made out with a tugboat?"
6, 109, "Leela", "Guys, I didn't have time to mention it up there, but I want each of you to know what an honour it is to work with me."
6, 109, "Hermes", "Sweet ego of Montego! Someone build a wind farm in front of her mouth."
6, 109, "Abner Doubledeal", "Leela, I mean this. You're the greatest creative mind since blah, blah, blah-bity, blah. But it's two AM and you still haven't written tomorrow's episode."
6, 109, "Leela", "Well, you can't expect me to write it here, with everyone talking so loudly about how great I am."
6, 109, "Abner Doubledeal", "Sorry."
6, 109, "Leela", "I'm taking the ship to my quiet place so I can be alone. You non-creatives can catch a bus home."
6, 109, "Fry", "Non-creative? Ha! I'll have you know I bedazzle my own underpants."
6, 109, "Bender", "That was a helluva massage. Maybe the best there ever was. Say, where are we? Rumbledy-Hump?! It's real!"
6, 109, "Doingg", "I love eating vegetables. Don't you? They're like crunchy, green water."
6, 109, "Garbly", "I don't like 'em. They're icky-yucky!"
6, 109, "Lady Buggle", "Now, now, Garbly. If we don't eat our vegetables, we won't grow big and strong... Like Feffernoose."
6, 109, "Feffernoose", "I have to be big and strong to fight off the monsters. Did somebody say monsters?!"
6, 109, "Leela", "This will make a great episode. But talk slower. I can't type that fast."
6, 109, "Bender", "Well, well, well. You didn't make up that TV show! You just wrote down what these space twerps said!"
6, 109, "Leela", "Oh, hell."
6, 109, "Princess Num Num", "Leela said a Rumbledy-Hump no-no!"
6, 109, "Humplings", "Sometimes, when we're mad,We say words that are bad."
6, 109, "Humplings", "And poo-poo and pee-pee and penis and gay.Those are the ninety-eight words we don't say."
6, 109, "Bender", "My God. You stole all your ideas from those poor, innocent creatures and hogged all the credit?! I underestimated you."
6, 109, "Leela", "Wait! I can explain."
6, 109, "Bender", "Nah, don't ruin it. I'm lovin' the hypocrisy. It's like catchin' an evangelist in a whorehouse. That was the best Christmas ever."
6, 109, "Leela", "You know I hate lying. But those orphans were so proud of me, I couldn't bear to let them down."
6, 109, "Bender", "Pfff! At least Reverend Pickens had the dignity to jump out the whorehouse window with his pants around his ankles."
6, 109, "Princess Num Num", "Who's your friend, Leela? He sure has a shiny metal bumbledy-boop."
6, 109, "Bender", "Aw, they're so cute and harmless. No wonder you feel safe rippin' off their act."
6, 109, "Leela", "Bender! I feel bad enough already."
6, 109, "Bender", "I'm just messin' with ya. I love that you're gettin' rich off of them. 'Cause, now, I can get rich off of you!"
6, 109, "Leela", "Oh, Lord."
6, 109, "Bender", "From now on, you give me half the gross or I'll blow your cover."
6, 109, "Leela", "Fine. You'll get your cut. I don't really care about the money, anyway. I just wanna show those poor, disadvantaged orphans that they can succeed in life."
6, 109, "Bender", "Ugh. You are the worst kind of rich person."
6, 109, "Leela", "Be it parsnips or peppers or kale or zucchini."
6, 109, "Fry", "I like to relax with a spinach martini."
6, 109, "Bender", "A-gurgle bufwoozle didoodi houdini."
6, 109, "All", "'Cause we love our vegetables."
6, 109, "Abner Doubledeal", "And... Cut! That's a wrap, everybody. Ten-minute break, then we shoot season three."
6, 109, "Fry", "Leela, you may have become a Lady Gaga-esque fame hag, but you sure cheered up those orphans. Nice job."
6, 109, "Warden Vogel", "Thanks so much for inviting us to the taping. The kids haven't been this excited since food day!"
6, 109, "Leela", "Aw, thanks. They're my inspiration."
6, 109, "Bender", "But not your only inspiration. Am I right, Leels?"
6, 109, "Albert", "Is somebody standing on me?"
6, 109, "Bender", "I do love inconveniencing the underclass."
6, 109, "Warden Vogel", "Well, we'll be on our way. After we dig through your trash for aluminum. Okay, kids. Delta pattern. Go! Go! Go!"
6, 109, "Sally", "Miss Leela?"
6, 109, "Leela", "Yes, Sally?"
6, 109, "Sally", "I wanna show you the story I made up. That's Gum Drop, Sticky, Candy Corn, Sour Ball, and Jujube. They're brothers and sisters and they live in Butterscotch Hollow."
6, 109, "Leela", "Sally, that's wonderful. You came up with that yourself? Out of thin air? How?"
6, 109, "Sally", "You were an orphan and now you're the best writer ever, so I knew I could write too. Thank you for being my hero."
6, 109, "Leela", "I can't do this any more."
6, 109, "Professor Farnsworth", "I don't blame you. Having to wear a costume made from a hollowed-out walrus..."
6, 109, "Leela", "Everyone, I have a confession. I, Turanga Leela, winner of a Young People's Choice Award, a Peabody Jr, and two Training Emmys, am not what I appear to be. There's something I need to show you."
6, 109, "Bender", "Uh-oh."
6, 109, "Leela", "Continuing my confession, this is the hardest thing I've ever done."
6, 109, "Sally", "Harder than creating the bestest show in the world?"
6, 109, "Leela", "I didn't create anything. I stole it."
6, 109, "Bender", "Stealin' is a form of creativity!"
6, 109, "Leela", "No, it isn't. Guys! Come on out!"
6, 109, "Abner Doubledeal", "Holy moly again."
6, 109, "Lady Buggle", "Oh, hello, Leela. I was just telling my friends how they shouldn't eat food off the floor. Should we sing a song about it?"
6, 109, "Fry", "Yes, please!"
6, 109, "Leela", "No need, Lady Buggle."
6, 109, "Abner Doubledeal", "Say, what's goin' on here?"
6, 109, "Leela", "This planet is the real Rumbledy-Hump. And these creatures are the real Humplings. All I did was write down their adorably repetitious hijinks."
6, 109, "Sally", "You lied? Like Doingg did when he stole Garbly's pet pinecone?"
6, 109, "Doingg", "You told them about that?"
6, 109, "Leela", "I should've told the truth right away. These simply prairie folk have a simple prairie-ish life here. And I was wrong to exploit it for profit."
6, 109, "Lady Buggle", "I'm as sad as an upside-down smile."
6, 109, "Leela", "You mean a frown?"
6, 109, "Lady Buggle", "We didn't have a word for it... Until now."
6, 109, "Amy", "To think I put on an unflattering cupcake costume for you!"
6, 109, "Fry", "To think I borrowed money from you!"
6, 109, "Albert", "I was gonna ask you to marry me."
6, 109, "Sally", "I guess, if you can't make up stories, I can't neither."
6, 109, "Leela", "I deserve this. And more. Keep it coming!"
6, 109, "Abner Doubledeal", "Wait a second. As a big Hollywood TV producer, I think I know how to remedy this ethical lapse."
6, 109, "Lady Buggle", "So if you don't want a tapeworm or intestinal bug..."
6, 109, "Humplings", "Don't eat pastrami that fell on the rug."
6, 109, "Abner Doubledeal", "And... Cut! Ta-da! We got us a reality show! No writers. No actors. No problem."
6, 109, "Leela", "Doubledeal, this is disgraceful! You can't just rip off their real lives and put it on TV!"
6, 109, "Abner Doubledeal", "Wha? Who said anything about rippin' them off?"
6, 109, "Leela", "I did!"
6, 109, "Abner Doubledeal", "I'm payin' 'em. Gather 'round, gang. Here're your pay checks."
6, 109, "Garbly", "I can finally afford my speech therapy!"
6, 109, "Feffernoose", "And the health plan covers my generic Prozac!"
6, 109, "Lady Buggle", "Electricity, plumbing... Our lives are a jillion times better. And it's all thanks to you, Leela."
6, 109, "Leela", "Don't thank me! I should be punished! I've corrupted you and taught the orphans a terrible lesson."
6, 109, "Warden Vogel", "What orphans?! The kids were all adopted!"
6, 109, "Leela", "They were?! By who?!"
6, 109, "Abner Doubledeal", "Come on, kids. Let's get this place cleaned up for the next episode. Albert, pick up that pastrami and put it back on the craft services table."
6, 109, "Albert", "You're the boss, Daddy."
6, 109, "Leela", "Oh, God! What have I done?!"
6, 109, "Nina", "You've given us a new father and a full-time job! Which is more than most kids have!"
6, 109, "Leela", "But—"
6, 109, "Sally", "We love it here, Miss Leela. This is the funnest planet in the whole world!"
6, 109, "Leela", "Don't hug me! I've done a horrible thing! For God's sakes, somebody teach me a lesson!"
6, 109, "Orphans and Humplings", "We love Leela!"
6, 109, "Leela", "No!"
6, 110, "Fry", "Run, Leela! They're bouncing right at us!"
6, 110, "Bender", "So... Anybody hungry?"
6, 110, "Fry", "I could stuff myself."
6, 110, "Leela", "I'll use that free app that tells you what restaurants you're near."
6, 110, "Fry", "You mean the window?"
6, 110, "Leela", "Yes."
6, 110, "Lrrr", "I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8! I demand extra dipping sauce!"
6, 110, "Teenaged Alien", "How many?"
6, 110, "Lrrr", "Uh... Two."
6, 110, "Fishy Joe", "Welcome to Fishy Joe's. Today is Stroganoff Thursday. We are currently out of the following menu items."
6, 110, "Female voice", "Stroganoff."
6, 110, "Teenaged Alien", "May I take your order?"
6, 110, "Fry", "I'll have the Stroganoff."
6, 110, "Teenaged Alien", "Okay."
6, 110, "Bender", "Yeah, uh, gimme the fried spaghetti dinner breakfast pocket for lunch an', uh, a big bucket o' mixed sodas."
6, 110, "Teenaged Alien", "One kids meal. Got it."
6, 110, "Leela", "Huh. Buggalo tots?"
6, 110, "Leela", "What exactly are those made of?"
6, 110, "Teenaged Alien", "You got a warrant?"
6, 110, "Leela", "I'll just have something from the lite menu. How about the gardener lover's salad?"
6, 110, "Teenaged Alien", "What kinda cheese fillin' you want in that?"
6, 110, "Leela", "Ugh! Just gimme the fruit cup!"
6, 110, "Teenaged Alien", "Okey-doke. What kinda cheese fillin' you want in that?"
6, 110, "Leela", "Oh, God! Fruit is spelled F-R-O-O-T. And it's got quotation marks around it."
6, 110, "Fry", "Mmm. There's nothin' wrong with a little fast food once or twice a meal. Heart... Attack! I'm fine."
6, 110, "Leela", "Oh! I got a bone in my fruit! That's it. From now on, we're not eating anything unless we know what it is an' where it's from. We're going to the local farmers market."
6, 110, "Bender", "Aw, mom! Do we hafta?!"
6, 110, "Leela", "This is what I'm talkin' about! See all the dirt an' earwigs? That's the sign of healthy food."
6, 110, "Hydroponic farmer", "You think that's healthy? Try this. I found it growin' at the bottom of my hamper."
6, 110, "Leela", "Mmm! So fresh an' musty!"
6, 110, "Bulb", "It's what I do."
6, 110, "Thog", "Hello, tiny man. You want sample small-batch Amazonian maple syrup?"
6, 110, "Fry", "Sure. That's the kinda sap I like."
6, 110, "Thog", "You the kind of sap I like."
6, 110, "Fry", "I'm scaroused!"
6, 110, "Bender", "Zuban tobacco?! The richest, most obnoxious kind! Listen, pal. I'm lookin' for a versatile smoke. One that's equally good in a crowded elevator or an audience with the Pope."
6, 110, "Moustached Alien", "Forget the Pope, my friend. Smoke one of these and God himself will ask to be seated far away from you."
6, 110, "Bender", "Ooh!"
6, 110, "Leela", "Heirloom eggs?! That's so life-affirming! I'll bet you run your own hatchery. Just you and your wife... Matilda."
6, 110, "Brown-haired man", "No, ma'am. Matilda an' I gather them eggs in the forest. And Matilda's really more of a mongoose than a wife."
6, 110, "Leela", "You're a lucky man. But are they way more expensive than regular eggs?"
6, 110, "Brown-haired Man", "Way more."
6, 110, "Leela", "Ooh! I'll take a dozen."
6, 110, "Professor Farnsworth", "Wha?! You're not my breakfast friends! What are you doing here?!"
6, 110, "Amy", "Leela blackmailed us all into eating healthy, organic food."
6, 110, "Professor Farnsworth", "Blackmail? What does she have on you?"
6, 110, "Hermes", "As long as we eat 'er filthy scrambled eggs, you'll never find out."
6, 110, "Leela", "They're not filthy! They're wholesome, fertile, and fresh from the forest floor. There's some filth."
6, 110, "Fry", "FERTILE? What does that mean?"
6, 110, "Zoidberg", "It means it'll hatch into a tiny, little infant creature. Unless we cook it first. Hey, Leela! Hurry up with those scrambled infants!"
6, 110, "Fry", "What?! That's horrifying! Zoidberg, you're an in-Human monster."
6, 110, "Zoidberg", "What are you? My driver's license?"
6, 110, "Fry", "Eating a sweet, innocent chick before it's even hatched?! Oh-ho-ho-ho, no, you won'tn't! I refuse to eat an unborn animal! I'm gonna keep this egg safe and warm and secure. Until it hatches out into the world. And then I'm gonna eat it!"
6, 110, "Leela", "Should we turn on the TV?"
6, 110, "Hermes", "Nah."
6, 110, "Fry", "Bender, d'you mind? I'm roosting."
6, 110, "Bender", "I'm considerin' buyin' a yacht to house my Thoroughbreds. How d'you expect me to do that without smokin' a cigar?"
6, 110, "Fry", "Think of the unborn embryo!"
6, 110, "Bender", "That's what I'm gonna call the yacht. Stop pickin' me! Whoa!"
6, 110, "Fry", "Hey! Leggo my egg-o, crab-o!"
6, 110, "Hermes", "Stop it, Fry! That's sexual harassment!"
6, 110, "Zoidberg", "Yeah, come down off your round, white pulpit! You're just gonna eat that thing, anyway!"
6, 110, "Fry", "I was, but you can't sit on something for a week without falling in love with it. Whoever's in here deserves a chance at life. A chance to blossom into a beautiful young man. Like I did as a baby. And so I make this solemn vow... To do everything I can to make sure this wonderful, innocent creature enters this world happy, healthy, an'— All yours, Zoidberg."
6, 110, "Bender", "Aw! Look at the cute, little— I was gonna go yachting in those feet!"
6, 110, "Leela", "Relax, you babies. It's no different from stomping a puppy."
6, 110, "Fry", "Everyone stop! He's not gonna hurt you."
6, 110, "Bender", "I'm standin' in a pool of my own feet!"
6, 110, "Hermes", "Bender's right! Kill it before someone names it!"
6, 110, "Fry", "No! Mr. Peppy just wants to be our friend."
6, 110, "Hermes", "Oy!"
6, 110, "Fry", "Look"
6, 110, "Amy", "That's what we said about Zoidberg and look what that got us."
6, 110, "Zoidberg", "Amy has a point."
6, 110, "Fry", "Mr. Peppy's not like Zoidberg. He's my friend."
6, 110, "Zoidberg", "Aw!"
6, 110, "Calculon", "Where to... Adulterers?"
6, 110, "Monique", "Calculon?! Then it wasn't your body they found in the harbor after the bomb went off."
6, 110, "Calculon", "What bomb?"
6, 110, "Bender", "It takes more than that to surprise me, Bender.  What you doin', little buddy? Uh, yeah... Uncle Bender... He's your friend.  Huh? Oh, you wanna play fetch!  Come on, boy! Get the ball.  Dumb jerk. Come on! Get the ball."
6, 110, "Hermes", "Sweet freak of Mozambique! That thing's colossal! It's gonna kill us all!"
6, 110, "Amy", "It's so huge! How big does one o' those things get?!"
6, 110, "Fry", "Well, that depends on what one o' those things is. That seems like a fact worth knowing."
6, 110, "Professor Farnsworth", "Good, startling news, everyone!"
6, 110, "Professor Farnsworth", "I found a description of the creature in this medieval monster manual. Just as I feared. Attack type J."
6, 110, "Amy", "No!  No!"
6, 110, "Professor Farnsworth", "Yes!  It kills its prey by sucking out the skeleton, leaving nothing but a puddle of flesh."
6, 110, "Amy", "Ew!"
6, 110, "Leela", "Ugh!"
6, 110, "Bender", "Ew!"
6, 110, "Professor Farnsworth", "Hence the Latin name bonus vampirus. Or, as you non-Catholics would say, the bone vampire!"
6, 110, "Zoidberg", "Dios mío."
6, 110, "Fry", "That's ridiculous. Mr. Peppy doesn't eat bones. I raised 'im on a simple diet o' Brussels sprouts an' mixed soda."
6, 110, "Hermes", "At least there's only one of 'em. The good news is they can't start breedin'."
6, 110, "Professor Farnsworth", "The bad news, everyone, is the beast reproduces asexually. A single bone vampire, left alone with some quiet music and some bone-vampire porn, could produce dozens of deadly offspring."
6, 110, "Zoidberg", "That lucky bastard. I say kill it!"
6, 110, "Fry", "But it loves me! And I love it."
6, 110, "Zoidberg", "Kill 'em both!"
6, 110, "Leela", "Killing them seems like a hassle. Can't we just set it free to live with its own kind?"
6, 110, "Professor Farnsworth", "Poor, ignorant Leela. The bone vampire is now extinct on its home planet."
6, 110, "Leela", "That's perfect! We can reintroduce it to the wild and repopulate the species!"
6, 110, "Fry", "Yeah! Let's do those Leela things."
6, 110, "Fry", "Well, buddy, how d'ya like your new home? See? He's happy already."
6, 110, "Hermes", "That thing doesn't have emotions, Fry. Its brain is the size of a walnut."
6, 110, "Fry", "So are walnuts and they're delicious. I'll miss you, Mr. Peppy. But you'll be happier here. So... Go on. Go. Goodbye, Mr. Peppy. Come on, man. Don't do this. Go on now. I mean it. Don't make this any harder than it has to be. It's time to let go! Ow! Thanks, Leela. He just needed a little extra push."
6, 110, "Leela", "Come on, Fry. Let's go home an'—"
6, 110, "Bender", "Hold up! There's alcohol around here somewhere. My Tanqueray-dar is goin' crazy. Aha-ha! Thought you could get away from me, huh? You lose again, you stupid intoxicant!"
6, 110, "Zoidberg", "We're not from around here. Hello!"
6, 110, "Man #1", ""
6, 110, "Hermes", "Excuse me, but we're guests on your planet. Speak English!"
6, 110, "Man #2", "Behave yourselves, gents. Off-worlders best be welcome here. Especially if we're trying to get the Olympics. May I buy you a drink? We don't get a lot of pretty faces around here."
6, 110, "Leela", "Uh... Sure. But I'm driving. I'll just have the smallest whisky you've got."
6, 110, "Man #2", "A small aquarium o' whisky for the busty lass!"
6, 110, "Leela", "Thanks. I suppose I should know your name if I'm gonna be drinking ten gallons of alcohol with you."
6, 110, "Man #2", "McZongo. Angus McZongo. Major Angus McZongo. Handsome Major Angus McZongo. Esquire."
6, 110, "Leela", "Ooh! Handsome and esquire. I'm Turanga Leela. My crew an' I are from Earth."
6, 110, "Angus McZongo", "So what brings you folks here to Doohan 6?"
6, 110, "Amy", "We just released an endangered animal back into the wild. A bone vampire!"
6, 110, "Hermes", "No need to thank us. Your shocked stares of gratitude say it all."
6, 110, "Angus McZongo", "Dear God. You brought back the bone vampire?! The damn things wreaked bloody havoc on our livestock for centuries!"
6, 110, "Woman", "Aye! Until McZongo 'ere shot 'em all into extinction, 'e did."
6, 110, "Man #3", "Now we've got more livestock than we can slaughter. Oh, aye. 'Tis a Bonnie time to be an ignorant villager."
6, 110, "Man #4", "We kinna have no murderin' bone vampires back 'ere!"
6, 110, "Man #3", "Kill it afore it puts a bun in its own oven and repopulates the bleedin' planet!"
6, 110, "Fry", "No!"
6, 110, "Angus McZongo", "Angus is right."
6, 110, "Hermes", "I thought you were named Angus."
6, 110, "Man #1", "We're all named Angus!"
6, 110, "Fry", "Please! Mr. Peppy won't attack your livestock. He's a vegetarian and 'e's not even preachy about it!"
6, 110, "Angus McZongo", "Poppycock. Once he gets the smell o' bones, there'll be no stoppin' 'im. Tonight, Mr. Peppy must die."
6, 110, "Leela", "Angus, wait. My strictly platonic friend is right. At least wait a few days before you decide to kill it."
6, 110, "Angus McZongo", "The last time I hesitated, a bone vampire snicked out me left shin."
6, 110, "Leela", "Please! Just a few days."
6, 110, "Angus McZongo", "Well, 'twould give us a chance to get to know each other. The beast lives! For now."
6, 110, "Leela", "Thank you, Angus."
6, 110, "Men", "You're welcome!"
6, 110, "Fry", "I don't trust that McZongo. Maybe I should go keep an eye on Mr. Peppy."
6, 110, "Leela", "Don't worry about McZongo. He an' I are having brunch tomorrow. I'm thinking of wearing this."
6, 110, "Fry", "It's nice! But there's still somethin' I don't like about that guy. My dad always said you could tell a lot about a man by the rigidity of 'is shins."
6, 110, "Zoidberg", "What is?!"
6, 110, "Man #1", "UNKNOWN, Gryffindor, Slytherin an' Hufflepuff! It killed Little Angus!"
6, 110, "Professor Farnsworth", "They're all dead! And their bones are gone! This was no accident."
6, 110, "Angus McZongo", "Still think your Mr. Peppy is harmless, Fry?"
6, 110, "Fry", "He wouldn't do this in our sleep. He would not, could not to a sheep."
6, 110, "Angus McZongo", "The deal is off! The beast must die!"
6, 110, "Bender", "Ooh! Pimpy!"
6, 110, "Fry", "What are we supposed to do? Just sit here and wait for Mr. Peppy to be killed?"
6, 110, "Bender", "Sounds like a plan! Guess I'll pass the time by lightin' up an El Jerko!"
6, 110, "Leela", "Okay! That's it! I need some air."
6, 110, "Leela", "Who's there? Hermes, is this one o' your zany practical jokes?"
6, 110, "Fry", "Leela, are you okay? Did you drink too many aquaria?"
6, 110, "Hermes", "Look! The bone vampire!"
6, 110, "Leela", "Mr. Peppy attacked me. Quick! Count my bones. There should be two-hundred-and-five!"
6, 110, "Leela", "Okay. That's better. Keep 'em comin'!"
6, 110, "Professor Farnsworth", "I'm sorry, Fry, but no vegetarian could've done this."
6, 110, "Fry", "I know. An', as much as I love Mr. Peppy, I love Leela more. He has to be... Put down."
6, 110, "Amy", "Aw, don't feel bad. Major McZongo's an experienced hunter. He'll blow Mr. Peppy's head off as painlessly as possible."
6, 110, "Fry", "No! Not McZongo! If anyone's gonna kill Mr. Peppy, it should be me."
6, 110, "Zoidberg", "Fry, I know you're upset right now, but I hope you'll consider donating the body to science dinner."
6, 110, "Fry", "Here, Mr. Peppy. Mmm. Lovely bones."
6, 110, "Hermes", "We've been walkin' for hours. I hope we can find our way back."
6, 110, "Amy", "Don't worry. I left a trail of bread crumbs."
6, 110, "Bender", "An' I left a trail of cigars!"
6, 110, "Leela", "You don't have to do this, Fry. Mr. Peppy just gave me a little love concussion."
6, 110, "Fry", "Thanks, Leela, but I have no choice. I can't let my monstruous deboner get anywhere near you."
6, 110, "Hermes", "There it is!"
6, 110, "Fry", "Well, this is it. You guys wait here. This is gonna kill him more than it does me. Goodbye, boy. I'll think of you whenever I sit on something round."
6, 110, "Amy", "What's happening?! Did you kill it?!"
6, 110, "Mr. Peppy", "The bloody idiot bloody-shot me! I'm all bloody-bloody!"
6, 110, "Bender", "Wha?!"
6, 110, "Fry", "Mr. Peppy?! Bullets make you talk?!"
6, 110, "Bender", "That's not Mr. Peppy!"
6, 110, "Amy", "Jinkies! He Scooby-Doo-ed us!"
6, 110, "Leela", "Why, Major McZongo? Why?"
6, 110, "Angus McZongo", "Oh, it's been thirty years since last I killed a bone vampire. The villagers dinna idolise me like they used to."
6, 110, "Amy", "You seem pretty popular at the pub."
6, 110, "Angus McZongo", "I work there as a greeter! Your beast was my chance to be a hero again. But the damn thing was a vegetarian! So I slaughtered the sheep meself."
6, 110, "Leela", "But why did you attack me?"
6, 110, "Angus McZongo", "So I could impress you by seeking revenge on the creature. Us greeters don't get a lot of action. On paper, it seemed like a win-win situation."
6, 110, "Professor Farnsworth", "Do you realise what this means, Fry?! Your pet's not dangerous after all!"
6, 110, "Fry", "I told ya! Mr. Peppy's a lover, not a fighter. Like Dwayne ""The Rock"" ""The Tooth Fairy"" Johnson."
6, 110, "Zoidberg", "UNKNOWN! Hey. What's that bone-sucking sound?"
6, 110, "Fry", "It's Mr. Peppy! I'd know 'im anywhere."
6, 110, "Leela", "Huh. So, apparently, Major McZongo and Mr. Peppy were each doing about half the sheep killing."
6, 110, "Fry", "Why, Mr. Peppy? Why? Ooh. That tickles. Now I really do have to kill you."
6, 110, "Man #3", "Wait! Don't shoot. The beast is a godsend. Like I said, we've more livestock than we can slaughter. But, thanks to this ravenous bogle, that's nae more a problem."
6, 110, "Man #5", "Angus is right. The cursed thing even debones 'em. Which is perfect for today's fast-paced, lazy consumer."
6, 110, "Man #1", "Dersu Uzala, Yojimbo, Rashomon! The beast must live!"
6, 110, "Leela", "You know what the best part is? From now on, whenever we're eating fresh, organic space meat, we'll know exactly where it comes from."
6, 110, "Fry", "One bucket o' double-friend, triple-salted, boneless sheep tots, please."
6, 110, "Teenaged Alien", "What kinda cheese fillin' you want in that?"
6, 110, "Fry", "All kinds."
6, 110, "Leela", "Eh... Make it two."
6, 110, "Leela", "An' a small whisky. Large."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Good news, everyone! Remember when you asked to see my family tree?"
6, 111, "Leela, Bender, Zoidberg, Hermes, Amy, and Fry", "No."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Ta-da!  This is my ancestor Philo Farnsworth, inventor of television and, as a bonus, childhood obesity.  And here's Dean Farnsworth, developer of the Farnsworth test for colour blindness.  Where is he, blast it?!  And, just recently, I learned of a modern-day Farnsworth, who invented the anti-senility truss."
6, 111, "Leela", "That's you, Professor."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Wha?!  Ah, yes. The Farnsworths boast a proud and distinguished lineage. No wormy fruit on this tree."
6, 111, "Amy", "What about Fry?  Isn't he your distant uncle?"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Very distant. Not a true Farnsworth, mind you.  He's way over here on this filthy branch riddled with fungus and dung beetles."
6, 111, "Fry", "What's with the seventeen dung beetles?"
6, 111, "Hermes", "Well, it's six o'clock.  I guess we'll have to deliver that Human heart tomorrow. Good work, people!"
6, 111, "Bender", "Woohoo! Time to go clubbin'.  Baby seals, here I come."
6, 111, "Fry", "Guess I better head over to my night job."
6, 111, "Leela", "You have a night job?"
6, 111, "Fry", "Yup. It's exhausting, but I need the extra money to buy coffee so I can stay awake for my night job."
6, 111, "Leela", "But—"
6, 111, "Fry", "Gotta go!"
6, 111, "Fry", "Woo!"
6, 111, "Dr. Cahill", "You've got a surprising amount of algae in your beard, Mr. President. Just sit still and let the algae eater do its work."
6, 111, "Abraham Lincoln's head", "Ooh! Ow!  Ooh! Lay off my trademark mole."
6, 111, "Dr. Cahill", "Hi, Lars."
6, 111, "Fry", "Fry."
6, 111, "Dr. Cahill", "Whatever.  I'm heading out to my night job.  Remember"
6, 111, "Fry", "I wanna go to that museum!"
6, 111, "Bill Clinton's head", "Man, this place is a snooze. Hey, Fry, I challenge President Taft 'ere to a pie-eatin' contest."
6, 111, "William Taft's head", "You're on, skinny!"
6, 111, "Fry", "Sorry, guys. You know the rules. ""No fun allowed."""
6, 111, "Andrew Jackson's head", "Come on, you pansy! I'm thirsty. I want me some Tennessee loopy juice!"
6, 111, "Warren Harding's head", "And I want loose women. The kind that aren't afraid to show a little ankle."
6, 111, "James Madison's head", "Or elbow."
6, 111, "Fry", "No visitors! I'll lose my job."
6, 111, "Rutherford B. Hayes' head", "Oh, boo-hoo! I'll lose my minimum-wage job."
6, 111, "Fry", "You're mean, Rutherford B. Hayes!"
6, 111, "Franklin D. Roosevelt's head", "Listen here, young man! We have nothing to fear but running out of beer."
6, 111, "Fry", "Alright. One small get-together. But let's keep it quiet and dignified."
6, 111, "Zoidberg", "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"
6, 111, "Bender", "Woohoo! Yeah, alright!"
6, 111, "Scruffy, Leela, Hermes, and Bender", "Four more beers! Four more beers!"
6, 111, "Amy", "Yes! Right in the ike!"
6, 111, "James Madison's head", "Nice elbow action."
6, 111, "Hermes", "So... You grow hemp?"
6, 111, "Thomas Jefferson's head", "Yes."
6, 111, "Hermes", "And... You do what with it?"
6, 111, "Thomas Jefferson's head", "All manner of things. Manufacture paper, fabric, rope..."
6, 111, "Hermes", "Oh. Well, nice talking to you."
6, 111, "Thomas Jefferson's head", "Why, I used to smoke about four feet of rope a day."
6, 111, "Hermes", "Let me give you my pager number."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Hey, Reagan. Remember when you asked to see my family tree?"
6, 111, "Ronald Reagan's head", "I asked you to leave me alone."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "The Farnsworths are a remarkable—"
6, 111, "George Washington's head", "Farnsworth?!  That name is a stain on American history! One of the worst traitors of the Revolution was a Farnsworth!"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "You're lying!"
6, 111, "Leela", "He's George Washington! He tends not to do that!"
6, 111, "George Washington's head", "David Farnsworth was a notorious British agent and counterfeiter.  He conspired to bring down our nation with his fraudulent currency."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "A Farnsworth did this?!  Oh, dear! My good name is ruined!"
6, 111, "Gerald Ford's head", "Hi! I'm Jerry. I like movies."
6, 111, "Bender", "Anyone seen Ulysses Grant?  He owes me a cheroot."
6, 111, "Leela", "He's over there, pukin' in the Bushes."
6, 111, "George H. W. Bush's head and George W. Bush's head", "No!"
6, 111, "Fry", "Oh, boy."
6, 111, "Dr. Cahill", "Mr. Fry!  Why are all these people standing around?   When they should be partying!"
6, 111, "Amy, Bender, and Hermes", "Alright!"
6, 111, "Zoidberg", "Hey, hey, LBJ. You wanna get drunk?"
6, 111, "Lyndon Johnson's head", "Oh, hell, yeah.  Whoa!"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Zoidberg, no!  The effects of jar juice aren't fully understood!"
6, 111, "Zoidberg", "Uh... Not bad. A hint of vitalis and—"
6, 111, "Amy", "I recognise this!  It's the 1960s!  I did a report on it for my drug-taking class."
6, 111, "Blond man", "Hi. I'm Andy Warhol and you're some kind of... Marvellous lobster man."
6, 111, "Zoidberg", "Right on! Say, you got any real soup or just this schlock?"
6, 111, "Andy Warhol", "What a horrid bore."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Ooh."
6, 111, "Amy", "Wha?"
6, 111, "Zoidberg", "Far out! That head gave me a total head trip!"
6, 111, "Fry", "Really?!  I'm gonna lick Herbert Hoover's head!"
6, 111, "Zoidberg, Leela, Amy, Hermes, and several heads", "Lick the head!  Lick the head!"
6, 111, "Bender", "Whoa! A speakeasy.  One prohibited beverage, please."
6, 111, "Bartender", "Hey, Dutch. The new still is here."
6, 111, "Bender", "I'm not a still!  I just smell like one!"
6, 111, "Male voice", "Dutch Schultz, come out with your bootleg whisky. We're thirsty!"
6, 111, "Hermes", "What the heck is goin' on?! Jefferson, did you sell me some bad rope?!"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "It must have something to do with the jar fluid.  Aha!  Dr. Cahill, do I detect a trace of opal essence?"
6, 111, "Dr. Cahill", "Very observant, Professor. To preserve the heads, we use a rare form of powdered crystalline opal.  This is the world's entire supply.  Yet it's so powerful, it should last a thousand years. It keeps the heads alive, but... We don't know how."
6, 111, "Amy", "Why did it give us those hallucinations?"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Because it didn't!"
6, 111, "Amy", "Uh... Yuh-huh!"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Opal has unusual temporal properties.  It preserves each head in a time-stasis bubble. Ergo, licking those heads actually sent us back in time to their original eras.  Look!"
6, 111, "Zoidberg", "Fuh! Schlock and more schlock!"
6, 111, "Dutch Schultz", "Pssst! Is the coast clear?"
6, 111, "Bender", "Button your yap, you mug!"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "I've discovered a new means of time travel! I'll call it the Farnsworth effect!"
6, 111, "George Washington's head", "Nice try.  But even this discovery won't undo the treachery wrought by your nefarious ancestor David Farnsworth."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "It will if we go back in time and stop him!"
6, 111, "Leela", "Professor, no!  You can't tongue the father of our country!"
6, 111, "Fry", "Where are we? Also, when are we?"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "68th and Broadway, colonial era.  Rush hour."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "By my calculations, this head trip will last, at most, 24 hours. We need to stop that monster, David Farnsworth!"
6, 111, "Leela", "Look at the date on this newspaper.  April 17th, 1775."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Say, on this exact date, the Continental Congress was meeting secretly in New York. Maybe they can help us."
6, 111, "Bender", "But they could be meetin' anywhere!  What are we gonna do? Search building to building?"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "We'll start with that one."
6, 111, "Thomas Jefferson", "Alexander Hamilton of New York, how say you?"
6, 111, "Alexander Hamilton", "Nay."
6, 111, "Thomas Jefferson", "John Hancock and John Adams of Massachusetts?"
6, 111, "John Adams", "Yay."
6, 111, "John Hancock", "Yay."
6, 111, "Thomas Jefferson", "The yay's have it. Our nation's official joke state shall be New Jersey.  Uh-oh."
6, 111, "John Adams", "Ah, 'tis just our new Crockpot."
6, 111, "Bender", "Watch it, Wiggy! I ain't no stinking crock!"
6, 111, "John Adams", "We'll see about that in five hours."
6, 111, "John Hancock", "Halt! From whence commeth thou, one-eyed maiden!"
6, 111, "Leela", "Uh, ever been to Peru?"
6, 111, "John Hancock", "Certainly not!"
6, 111, "Leela", "I'm from Peru."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Clam up, founding fathers! We need help locating the treacherous forger  who forged this forgery!"
6, 111, "Thomas Jefferson", "My word! If these enter circulation, our economy will be destroyed! And with it, our chance at independence!"
6, 111, "Alexander Hamilton", "Only one man in the colonies has a printing press fine enough to make these. Our good friend, Ben Franklin."
6, 111, "Leela", "Uh-oh. Isn't Franklin in Philadelphia?"
6, 111, "Thomas Jefferson", "When he's not in Charlotte, or Maribel, or Louisa!"
6, 111, "Fry", "I don't get it."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "I'm sure no one's ever said this before, but I must get to Philadelphia as quickly as possible!"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Oh! Why couldn't my disgraced ancestor have lived in the NASCAR era?!"
6, 111, "Woman", "Dr. Franklin, your new steam engine is here."
6, 111, "Bender", "I ain't no stinkin' steam engine!  Chicken's ready."
6, 111, "Benjamin Franklin", "You may go, Louisa."
6, 111, "Fry", "Now I get it!"
6, 111, "Benjamin Franklin", "Fascinating. Be you man or machine?"
6, 111, "Bender", "Mostly machine. Might be a couple dead cats in there."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Dr. Franklin, with all due respect to the brilliant inventor of the...  stove, I must speak with you.  I'm looking for the scoundrel who made  this!"
6, 111, "Benjamin Franklin", "Intricate filigree, satanic symbols, looks like one of mine.  But no! This is a fake!"
6, 111, "Fry", "Duh! It says  ""Colony of Maffachufetts""!"
6, 111, "Bender", "More like ""Taxachufetts""!"
6, 111, "Benjamin Franklin", "That's just how we print S's, you ""ƒtupid ƒhitheads""! Someone must've used my press while I was poking around in Charlotte. Let's ask my apprentice, David Farnsworth."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Farnsworth?!! That's him! Arm yourselves!"
6, 111, "Benjamin Franklin", "I call it ""the Franklinator""."
6, 111, "Benjamin Franklin", "The apprentice's suite is empty! He's gone!"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Wait! What's that glistening in the chamber pot?"
6, 111, "Bender", "Let's find out."
6, 111, "Leela", "Bender, do you know what a chamber pot is?"
6, 111, "Bender", "I don't know and I don't care!"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "A Massachusetts hapenny?"
6, 111, "Bender", "Probably fake, too. There's one way to find out.  What?"
6, 111, "Fry", "Bender bent a poo penny! Bender bent a poo penny!"
6, 111, "Benjamin Franklin", "Look! 'Tis but worthless tin!"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Where could Farnsworth have minted such a high quality fake?"
6, 111, "Benjamin Franklin", "Not here. But, you know, I have a friend in Boston who's an expert silversmith. They could be connected.  There's only like forty people who do anything around here."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "But Boston's 300 miles away and Bender kicked our horse to death! We'll never get there in time! Unless you have another ""invention"" up your sleeve! Foh!"
6, 111, "Benjamin Franklin", "Hmmm..."
6, 111, "Bender", "How's this going to get us to Boston?"
6, 111, "Bender", "Stupid Franklin—"
6, 111, "Paul Revere", "Ah, that scrap metal I ordered is here."
6, 111, "Bender", "I'm 40% scrap metal."
6, 111, "Paul Revere", "Well, Ben Franklin,  my fellow Son of Liber—  Tea kettles, heh. Yes, I've made some new tea kettles. Perfect for special occasions. Like hanging King George in effigy—  and H and I are monograms you can put on those tea kettles.  Whatta you looking at, you British bastards?!?!?!"
6, 111, "Benjamin Franklin", "Paul, we talked about this."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Mr. Revere, we're looking for a counterfeiter who minted  these smelly hapennies. His name is David Farnsworth."
6, 111, "Paul Revere", "Farnsworth? I just hired him for the fall candlestick rush. He's in the foundry this very moment!"
6, 111, "Benjamin Franklin", "Everybody take a Franklinator."
6, 111, "Fry", "Aw, I gotta chipmunk."
6, 111, "Leela", "Hee-ya!"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsoworth", "David Farnsworth, I presume?"
6, 111, "David Farnsworth", "I'm David Farnsworth."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Fuff! You're a disgrace to the very name Fowvwuh!"
6, 111, "Fry", "Look out! He's got a bezeling planisher!"
6, 111, "David Farnsworth", "'At's right! 'Oo wonts ta be bezel'd?!"
6, 111, "Bender", "You idiot, I'm not a cannon!"
6, 111, "Bender", "Oh, I guess I am a cannon."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Time to prune the family tree!  Huzzah! I've saved the Farnsworth name!"
6, 111, "Man", "An urgent message for Mr. Revere!"
6, 111, "Paul Revere", "Mr. Revere, pray, do not 'ƒhit' your pants. The British attack has begun. Cross the river and watch for my signal.  I must ride."
6, 111, "Leela", "He has so much stuff.  He won't miss this."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Let's burn these counterfeits and paddle the next swan boat the hell out of Boston."
6, 111, "Fry", "Here you go."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Thanks.  Say, where did you get that lantern?"
6, 111, "Fry", "From that old church to the north.  They had two burning, so I figured they wouldn't miss one."
6, 111, "Paul Revere", "One if by land. Two if by sea.   The British are coming! The British are coming!   By land! By land!  Gotta treat this OCD. Gotta treat this OCD."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Fry, you dope! You've really screwed the granny this time! History needed that second lantern!"
6, 111, "Leela", "We better stop Paul Revere before—"
6, 111, "Leela", "I guess everything worked out jolly oll right, eh, guv'nor?"
6, 111, "Bender", "Wot's with th' fruity accent, ducky? Bollocks! Ah've got it, too!"
6, 111, "Fry", "Where's all th' Presidents' heads, then?"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Ah say, appears we've changed 'istory too much, disahster of nightmarish proportions an' wotnot.  Quite."
6, 111, "Hermes", "Where 'ave you blokes been?  You nearly missed elevenses."
6, 111, "Amy", "Who's for tea and shmavories?"
6, 111, "Bender", "Wot in bloody 'ell's goin' on aroun' 'ere ah says?"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Indeed. Wot's become of the dear old USA?"
6, 111, "Amy", "Beg pardon?"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "The Revolution? 1776 and wot all?"
6, 111, "Hermes", "Oh, the Colonial Desktop(?).  Well, there's nuthin' we Brits enjoy more dan a good document'ry. Turn on the televiser, Dr. Zoidsmythe."
6, 111, "Zoidsmythe", "I'll dial up the Beeb. They've always got a nice doccy-woccy on."
6, 111, "Narrator", "The Vanquished Pride of the Yankees,  or  America the Dutiful!  North America or Wes' Britannia as we now call it, has been under British rule for fourteen-hundred years...  all thanks to a nutter known as ""Wrong Way Revere""."
6, 111, "Animated Revere", "The British are coming, by land, by land! Heh heh heh heh!"
6, 111, "Narrator", "But we came by sea, we did. Surprised the Yanks at Lexington ending the Rebellion with narry a kipper scuffed."
6, 111, "Amy", "Scuffed kippers, anyone?"
6, 111, "Zoidsmythe", "Right kind of you, mum."
6, 111, "Narrator", "The humiliated conspirators were forced to sign the Declaration of Dependence, proclaiming British rule forever.  Meanwhile, a loyal Brit by the name of David Farnsworth tracked down the traitor George Washington and bravely smothered him with his wig."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Oh, criminy!"
6, 111, "Narrator", "In gratitude, King George named Farnsworth a duke and granted his family massive land holdings in the colonies."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Blimey. I've never felt so ashamed to be a Farnsworth."
6, 111, "Scruffy", "Will m'lord be returning to his massive land holdings for luncheon?"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Huh-woh?"
6, 111, "Leela", "I know we're ladies-in-waiting but what are we waiting for?"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "How should I know? Just shut up and wait!"
6, 111, "Bender", "Say, how is it that we've got socialized medicine  bot me teeth still loo' like this?"
6, 111, "Fry", "Con't we just go back in time an' set things roight again?"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Don't want to. Rather nice living under the crown and so forth."
6, 111, "Zoidsmythe", "Rather."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Wot's more, couldn't go back even if we wonted to.  No more crystalline opal left in all the world, don't you know."
6, 111, "Scruffy", "M'lord, the Queen is here for 'er, eh, weekly, irrrrr, visit."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "The Queen? Sounds most satisfactory. All of you out!"
6, 111, "Bender", "Right, then. Let's go play some quoits...wotever that is."
6, 111, "Squire", "Presenting the Queen of England, America, and two parking spaces in Tokyo."
6, 111, "Queen", "Where's me consort at?"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "C-C-Consort?"
6, 111, "Queen", "That's right, luv. Fer cent'ries, a Farnsworth gentleman 'as provided service to the Queen. Now close yer eyes an' think of England!"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Ah say, what's that in your crown?"
6, 111, "Queen", "You mean Andamooka Opal? Why, it's th' most precious gem in all th'—"
6, 111, "Bender", "Yes! Three rubbers on the hob!"
6, 111, "Queen", "Stop him! He crowned me in th' knickers an' nicked me crown!"
6, 111, "Smitty", "Freeze or we'll be forced to continue chasing you since we don't carry guns!"
6, 111, "URL", "Indubitably."
6, 111, "Leela", "We've got to go back in toime an' set things straight! 'Urry up an' lick Washin'ton's 'ead again!"
6, 111, "Bender", "We can't! There's no George Washington nor any other Presidents."
6, 111, "Fry", "Wot about this bloke?  'e's from Revolutionary times."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Farnsworth!"
6, 111, "David Farsnworth's head", "Hey! Yer the plaunkers wot candlesticked me! Well, ah showed you! Ah killed George Washin'ton an' now I'm married to one of the Spice Girls! Don't rightly know which one."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Bender, fetch me that powdered opal!"
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "It's time to restore dignity to the Farnsworth name!"
6, 111, "Fry", "There. That time, I left both lanterns in place."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "And I hit Farnsworth much, much harder. Eh, perhaps too hard."
6, 111, "Leela", "Look! All the Presidents are back! Even John Tyler!"
6, 111, "John Tyler's head", "That's the first time anyone's spoken to me in twelve-hundred years."
6, 111, "Professor Farnsworth", "Yes, from Chester A. Arthur to Chester Z. Arthur, they're all here. Our republic and the Farnsworth family name are saved.  And no one will ever know."
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Sr", "Double time, soldier.  I want this ice-fishin' operation up and runnin' by oh-eight-hundred hours."
6, 112, "Fry", "It's too cold, Dad. My teen region is freezing off."
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Sr", "You dunno what cold is.  I once survived an entire week trapped in a Swiss glacier, eatin' nothin' but frozen Neanderthal.  To this day, I can't stand the taste of early hominid."
6, 112, "Fry", "Let's just get inside the shack."
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Sr", "Hold, maggot!"
6, 112, "Fry", "Ow!"
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Sr", "Remember the code o' the ice! Thick an' blue, tried an' true. Thin an' crispy, way too risky."
6, 112, "Fry", "Shows what you know.  Crispy doesn't even rhyme with risky.  Help! I'm drowning!"
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Sr", "Don't worry, son.  You'll freeze before you drown."
6, 112, "Fry", "I love ice fishing."
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "I shouldn't be out in this cold. I 'ave no protective fat, hair, or warm blood. I'm not even legally a mammal."
6, 112, "Fry", "Pfff!  You dunno what cold is.  I was frozen for a thousand years."
6, 112, "Bender", "You were?! Uh.  Learn somethin' dumb every day."
6, 112, "Paper-hatted salesman", "Live bait!"
6, 112, "Paper-hatted salesman", "Get your live bait here.  Whoa!   Fresh-killed bait!"
6, 112, "Amy", "Can we get inside the shack?  I'm wearing a belly parka!"
6, 112, "Leela", "If I understand ice fishing, and I'm pretty sure I don't, we'll need to laser-blast a hole in the ice."
6, 112, "Fry", "No. No crazy technology.  Here. Bender, use your immense Robot strength to drill a hole the old-fashioned way."
6, 112, "Bender", "I don't see any irony in that."
6, 112, "Fry", "And... Woilà !"
6, 112, "Fry", "Everybody's ice-fishing!  How come nobody's ice-fishing?"
6, 112, "Bender", "Hot-cocoa break."
6, 112, "Fry", "Cocoa is for yodelling babies.  If you're sober, it isn't ice fishing."
6, 112, "Fry", "Mom, what's my temperature?"
6, 112, "Mrs. Fry", "Fifty. Forty-five.  Forty. It's all over!  Woo!  Down at the 35!"
6, 112, "Fry", "I'm really sick."
6, 112, "Mrs. Fry", "Huh?  Oh, sorry.   Hundred-an'-nine.  We'll check again at half-time."
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Sr", "You home from school, you traitor?"
6, 112, "Fry", "I fell through the ice!  Cut me some slack!"
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Sr", "Nobody cut me any slack when I broke my spine.  Didn't even take a day off o' work.  Lotta people depend on you when you sell trampolines door to door."
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Jr", "Here's your homework, ya lucky knob."
6, 112, "Fry", "And, with a little more luck from my seven-leaf clover, I might get sick enough to miss the whole semester."
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Jr", "Hey, give me that!"
6, 112, "Fry", "Ooh."
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Jr", "Come on."
6, 112, "Fry", "No."
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Jr", "Give it to me, ya faker!"
6, 112, "Fry", "No. You're not gettin'—  Ow! My underbite!"
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Sr", "Come on, Yancy!  Your brother's sick!  You'll never have a better chance to take 'im out."
6, 112, "Fry", "Dad!  Nerd Search '88?  What's this?"
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Jr", "Some stupid science contest for smart wads.  NASA's gonna pick one kid's experiment to launch into space."
6, 112, "Fry", "I can make a space experiment.  I just got a new thing o' glitter!"
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Sr", "I'm not sure science is your thing, seein' how that chimp at the zoo tricked you outta your allowance."
6, 112, "Fry", "Yeah, well, I'll show you.   And Mr. Bananas.  Anyway, I've got nothin' better to do while I'm sick in bed. Wait. That's it! I'll make a space experiment about the common cold!  Where's that contest flyer?"
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Sr", "You're holdin' it, genius."
6, 112, "Fry", "Oh, good."
6, 112, "Fry", "I feel awful.  But it was worth it to catch an' kill this baby fish."
6, 112, "Amy", "Shmeez!  What's with the shmiffling?"
6, 112, "Fry", "It's nothing.  Just a common cold."
6, 112, "Zoidberg", "Wha?"
6, 112, "Bender", "It's a common uh?"
6, 112, "Hermes", "Wha?"
6, 112, "Leela", "What the hell's a common cold?"
6, 112, "Bender", "Is it valuable? Could it be taken from you if you were, say...  Unconscious?"
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "A common—  A common cold?! No!   No!   Ever since Fry first came to us, I've lived in mortal terror that this would happen!"
6, 112, "Leela", "I never heard you mention that."
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "Oh, I try to act cool, but inside I'm  freaking out!"
6, 112, "Fry", "It's just a cold!  What's the big deal?"
6, 112, "Smitty", "This is the police.  An unknown pathogen 'as been detected on these premises.  Come out with your hands—  I mean... Stay in with your hands up!"
6, 112, "URL", "You are hereby quarantined until such time as it is deemed safe to enter and shoot your asses."
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "Eh, now, now.  Let's not all panic at once. We'll have to take shifts.  Hermes, you'll take the first six hours."
6, 112, "Hermes", "Very well."
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "Louder!   Louder!   Crybaby."
6, 112, "Fry", "Look"
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "No, it won't!  The common cold died out five-hundred years ago. And, subsequently, Humanity lost all resistance to its ravages. But the virus survived in you...   Frozen for a thousand years."
6, 112, "Fry", "Huh.  So it was hiding deep down inside o' me? Like my skeleton bones?"
6, 112, "Leela", "Give it to us straight, Professor. How incredibly deadly is it?"
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "We don't know.  It could kill millions or nobody. I suppose it might even bring a few people back to life!  Anything is possible in science."
6, 112, "Amy", "Oh, no!  I've got it too!  My nose is all gunked up with blork!"
6, 112, "Hermes", "And I've got a hankerin' for a useless remedy created by a schoolteacher."
6, 112, "Zoidberg", "Uh-oh. I think I'm getting swollen glands."
6, 112, "Amy", "Ew!"
6, 112, "Hermes", "Oh!"
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "Oh!"
6, 112, "Leela", "Screw the quarantine! I'm outta here!"
6, 112, "Female CDC scientist", "Initiate containment procedure."
6, 112, "Leela", "Ah!  Ow!  Oh!"
6, 112, "Male CDC scientist", "G'wan now."
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "Now I'm sick!  I shudder to think what this cold will do to me. Yesterday, I was nearly killed by a tight hat!"
6, 112, "Bender", "I'd be remiss if I didn't rub your goopy noses in the fact that I'm immune."
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "Which is why we'll all be counting on you and you alone to nurse us through this catastrophe."
6, 112, "Bender", "Why, God?  Why 'ave I been singled out?"
6, 112, "Fry", "Everyone just calm down and make yourself a tissue walrus."
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Sr", "Damn it, son.   Lose the tissues. You're ruinin' Thanksgivin' dinner."
6, 112, "Fry", "I'm busy with my space experiment. I can't devote precious brainpower to blowing my nose."
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Sr", "You're never gonna win that science fair, Philip. Face it"
6, 112, "Mr. Panucci", "Hey, Barack!  Pizza goin' out.  Come on!"
6, 112, "Barack Obama", "Man, I've got to go back to law school."
6, 112, "Fry", "Pfff!  I'm not gonna wind up a loser like that guy."
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Jr", "Sure you will.  You're gonna lose the science fair.  And that's who's gonna beat ya.   Josh Gedgie, boy scientist."
6, 112, "Josh Gedgie", "Pi over four radians of pizza, please."
6, 112, "Mr. Panucci", "What is that? About a slice?"
6, 112, "Josh Gedgie", "More like exactly a slice."
6, 112, "Fry", "Game on, Gedgie."
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Jr", "Ew!"
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Sr", "I've 'ad worse. When I was shot down over Korea, I had to eat Kimchi.  He was our interpreter."
6, 112, "Bender", "Coming!"
6, 112, "Bender", "What now?"
6, 112, "Amy", "Humidifier."
6, 112, "Bender", "Fine.  Yes?!"
6, 112, "Leela", "Where's that chicken soup we asked for?"
6, 112, "Bender", "Chicken.  Water.  Fire.   You take it from there."
6, 112, "Hermes", "This is torture. The fever. The chills. And the sweating!  Amy's horrible sweating!"
6, 112, "Bender", "That's it. I'm leavin' while I still 'ave my dignity.   See you in the obituaries!"
6, 112, "Male CDC scientist", "How's the... Uh... Containment holdin' up?"
6, 112, "Female CDC scientist", "Without turning my head, I'd say one-hundred percent."
6, 112, "Bender", "Howdy, folks. And may I say, ""Nice work keepin' those sickos penned up."" Put 'er there.  You too, buddy.  An' you.  An' you.  An' you.  An' especially you."
6, 112, "Fifth CDC officer", "That Robot was a heckuva nice feller."
6, 112, "Fry", "You'd better stay here during biology.  Mrs. Jenkins dissects anything smaller than a fifth grader."
6, 112, "Josh Gedgie", "Well, if it isn't Grandmaster Phlegm. I heard you're enterin' the NASA science competition."
6, 112, "Fry", "Maybe I am... LL Fool J!"
6, 112, "Josh Gedgie", "So what's your project? The effects of losing on idiots?"
6, 112, "Fry", "No!  I'm gonna infect my guinea pig with the common cold and launch it into space to see if it gets cured by cosmic rays!"
6, 112, "Josh Gedgie", "Lame! Though the common-cold virus does seem like a judge pleaser.  I think I'll steal that an' do an experiment that's slightly less... Very stupid!"
6, 112, "Fry", "But that's my idea! You are an evil, evil nerd!"
6, 112, "Josh Gedgie", "Gedgie out!"
6, 112, "Fry", "We'll show him who's stupid."
6, 112, "Morbo", "Linda?"
6, 112, "Linda", "Morbo. The so-called common cold, introduced by living fossil Philip J. Fry, is spreading out of control.  All citizens are advised to wash their hands thoroughly after beating up Philip J. Fry."
6, 112, "Fry", "Phew!  Lucky I'm safely locked up here with you guys."
6, 112, "Amy", "There 'e is!"
6, 112, "Hermes", "Get him!"
6, 112, "Fry", "Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! What are you—"
6, 112, "Morbo", "The situation is expected to deteriorate as newscasters whip the city into a panic."
6, 112, "Morbo", "Run! Run for your lives!"
6, 112, "Linda", "And, finally, the heart-warming story of a handicapped magician who didn't know when to give up."
6, 112, "Zapp", "I don't like the looks of this, Mr. President.  Shall I switch it off?"
6, 112, "Richard Nixon's head", "Negative.  Rose Mary, release the Surgeon General!"
6, 112, "Woman", "Get in there!"
6, 112, "Wernstrom", "Ow!  It's bright out here."
6, 112, "Richard Nixon's head", "Wernstrom...  The quarantine 'as failed. Give me a worst-case scenario. And make it grim."
6, 112, "Wernstrom", "I've prepared some projections.  Should the virus escape Manhattan, this is how far it will spread in twelve hours.  This is twenty-four hours.  This is a Verizon coverage map.  And, in thirty-six hours, it will have infected the entire planet!"
6, 112, "Richard Nixon's head", "Options?"
6, 112, "Zapp", "We 'ave only one option.  Protocol sixty-two."
6, 112, "Richard Nixon's head", "Not possible. We don't 'ave nearly enough piranhas!"
6, 112, "Zapp", "Then protocol sixty-three it is."
6, 112, "Hermes", "Hooray!  They're letting us out!"
6, 112, "Zoidberg", "And hundreds of black hovercopters are coming to welcome us!"
6, 112, "Hermes", "They shrink-wrapped the hole city! Well, it could be worse.  It is worse!"
6, 112, "Zoidberg", "They're flying Manhattan into the Sun!  They must've been outta piranhas."
6, 112, "Hermes", "They're gonna kill the virus by exposing it to the heat of our burning bodies!"
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "I'm just glad I have my wool scarf."
6, 112, "Fry", "What good is a wool—"
6, 112, "Bender", "Guys! Guys! You're never gonna believe this!"
6, 112, "Amy", "We know! They shmooped up Manhattan and blasted us toward the Sun!"
6, 112, "Bender", "They did? Aw!  So that's why this was unguarded."
6, 112, "Wernstrom", "People of New New York, this is Surgeon General Ogden Vernstrom."
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "Wern--strom!"
6, 112, "Wernstrom", "No doctor likes hurling his patients into the Sun, but, since there is no way to make a vaccine for the common cold—"
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "There is a way to make a vaccine!"
6, 112, "Fry", "There is?   Yay!"
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "Of course, there's a catch."
6, 112, "Fry", "Woo!"
6, 112, "Fry", "Woo!  Yay! Yay!  So what's the catch?"
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "The vaccine requires the original, unmutated, 20th-century cold virus. So I need to grind you into a paste."
6, 112, "Leela", "Professor, no!"
6, 112, "Fry", "It's okay, Leela. This is all my fault, sort of. If this will save you, then, please, turn me into a virus milkshake."
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "He consented!  You all heard it!"
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Sr", "Yes, sir. Many of these entries merit a ride in the mighty bosom of our space shuttle.  And then there's your so-called entry."
6, 112, "Fry", "Jeez!  Walk much, Gedgie?!"
6, 112, "Josh Gedgie", "Absurd. You really think your guinea pig could survive in the vacuum of space?"
6, 112, "Fry", "He already survived in the vacuum of my mom.  I mean, ""My mom's vacuum."""
6, 112, "Josh Gedgie", "My experiment measures the effects of microgravity of the propagation of the common cold virus in an anaerobic environment; i.e., space.  Impressed?"
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Sr", "Damn right I am.  That's some dry, emotionless science.  Nice job, son."
6, 112, "Fry", "Hey, wait a second!  I know where you can get some 20th-century cold virus without killing me!"
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "Hush, lad.  I'm totally in the zone."
6, 112, "Fry", "We just 'ave to find the Nerd Search '88 satellite!"
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "I don't know why I even build these things."
6, 112, "Leela", "Gunnery Chief Bender, blast us out of quarantine."
6, 112, "Bender", "Aye, aye, lady."
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "Oh, fiddlepoop! Our weapons aren't strong enough to puncture a thin plastic tent that thick?!"
6, 112, "Leela", "No. But theirs are!"
6, 112, "Kif", "Captain, a ship is attempting to break the quarantine."
6, 112, "Zapp", "Blow them to baco bits with a well placed warning shot!"
6, 112, "Kif", "But—"
6, 112, "Zapp", "Oops."
6, 112, "Fry", "We'll find that cold virus.  The Nerd Search satellite was launched on the space shuttle and released into orbit."
6, 112, "Leela", "Hmmm. All ancient satellites were swept up as space junk in 2113.  I actually knew that offhand.  I'm Facebooking right now."
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "Aha!  That satellite was scuttled on Enceladus, Saturn's main dump moon!"
6, 112, "Fry", "Let's dump it up!"
6, 112, "Leela", "This is the exact location of the dump.  But there's nothing here."
6, 112, "Bender", "Can we please go home an' die now?"
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "I'm with Bender.  Whatever was here's been covered by centuries of ice buildup."
6, 112, "Fry", "No!  It's under here somewhere. We just 'ave to bust our way down.  Remember the code of the ice. Thin an' crispy, way too risky."
6, 112, "Leela", "I found a satellite!"
6, 112, "Fry", "Let's just hope the experiment's still in here.  Yes! We're saved!"
6, 112, "Man", "And now, to present the awards, our very special guest.  He walked on the Moon and now he is judging a high-school science contest.  Truly a man who can and will do anything... Dr. Buzz Aldrin!"
6, 112, "Buzz Aldrin", "Wow!  I could've used an introduction like that when I first met the Moon men!  But, seriously, there are Moon men.  Okay. This year's Nerd Search runner-up is a young man who devised a way to add and subtract in zero gravity.  Vijay Patel and his calculator space hat!"
6, 112, "Vijai Patel", "Woo!  Woo!"
6, 112, "Buzz Aldrin", "And now the grand-prize winner whose experiment will be launched into space."
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Sr", "Look at that cocky smirk.   My money's on Gedgie."
6, 112, "Fry", "Yeah? He may 'ave brains, but I 'ave heart."
6, 112, "Buzz Aldrin", "Josh Gedgie!"
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Sr", "I'll bring the car around."
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "What a well prepared virus culture.  This will make a fine vaccine."
6, 112, "Fry", "Good thing Gedgie won. My dumb experiment wouldn't've lasted an hour in space, let alone a thousand years. Besides, Buzz Aldrin ran over my guinea pig in the parking lot."
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "Eh, okay. Uh, come on, gang. Let's go inoculate everyone and cram Manhattan back into its rightful hole!"
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "This may hurt a little."
6, 112, "Wernstrom", "Ow!"
6, 112, "Professor Farnsworth", "Now, I'll give you the shot."
6, 112, "Leela", "You saved millions of lives, Fry. You should feel proud. No matter what your dad said to you."
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Sr", "You still 'aven't thanked me for pullin' you outta the lake, soldier."
6, 112, "Fry", "I could've flip-flopped out."
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Sr", "I know that.  Look, son.  I know I give you the business sometimes.  But, if I'm hard on you, it's only 'cause I want you to grow up strong and resilient.  Someday, you may face adversities so preposterous, I can't even conceive of them.  But I know you'll pull through and make me proud.  I love you, son."
6, 112, "Yancy Fry Sr", "Now, bundle up.  I don't want you gettin' frozen."
6, 113, "Fry", "Bucket of hot dogs?"
6, 113, "Cubert", "Check."
6, 113, "Fry", "Butt massager engaged?"
6, 113, "Bender", "Check."
6, 113, "Fry", "Then let the video games begin! Wait. Hang on. I— I lost my controller."
6, 113, "Cubert", "There is no controller. The X-Cube tracks your motions with a built-in camera."
6, 113, "Bender", "Oh, yeah? Track this motion."
6, 113, "Cubert", "Frykowski. BenderIsGreat34. Follow me!"
6, 113, "Bender", "Sounds like fun on the bun."
6, 113, "Cubert", "Aw! You guys again?!"
6, 113, "German #1", "Ach! These dorkeschoens. Let's humiliate them with slingshots."
6, 113, "Fry", "Shoot your weapon, Private!"
6, 113, "Bender", "Wait. How do I— Hold on. Oops."
6, 113, "German #1", "Sorry to kill und run, but I really must be Göring."
6, 113, "Fry", "Man!"
6, 113, "Bender", "Pwned again."
6, 113, "Cubert", "This is all Bender's fault. Admit it! Your reflexes suck!"
6, 113, "Bender", "Aw... It's true! My circuitry's twelve years outta-date. I can't keep up with today's high-speed, top-o'-the-line kids."
6, 113, "Fry", "You can't even keep up with me and I'm some sort o' stone-age throwback."
6, 113, "Cubert", "You know... I might be able to speed up your reflexes by overclockin' ya."
6, 113, "Bender", "Eh... What's that, sonny? You say it'll put some whoopiee in my cushion?"
6, 113, "Cubert", "This may take a while. I've got to adjust the memory timing, raise the CPU voltage, and delete twelve terabytes of outdated catchphrases."
6, 113, "Bender", "Sounds like fun on the bun!"
6, 113, "Female voice", "Deleted."
6, 113, "Bender", "Oh."
6, 113, "Leela", "Fry, can we talk about our relationship?"
6, 113, "Fry", "Of course. Our relationship is the best thing in my life, so I'm sure I'll enjoy talking about it with you."
6, 113, "Leela", "I dunno. I guess I'm just feeling uneasy about us being so on-again, off-again."
6, 113, "Fry", "Maybe it's none o' my business, but, if it were up to me, we'd be on all the time. An' I mean all the time."
6, 113, "Leela", "But what would that be like? I mean... If we were together, where would we be ten years from now? Still here?"
6, 113, "Fry", "Definitely. Or... Somewhere else."
6, 113, "Leela", "Maybe I'm havin' some kinda... Early-life crisis, but... Look"
6, 113, "Fry", "Well, sure, but... You're always in it. Also, sometimes, terminators."
6, 113, "Cubert", "Alright. You should run a lot faster now. Unless you die."
6, 113, "Bender", "Woo! I'm smart! I know how to spell aardvark. February is the shortest month. There's three-thousand-eighteen jelly beans in that jar."
6, 113, "Cubert", "Damn, I'm good."
6, 113, "Bender", "I mean three-thousand-eighteen rat kidneys."
6, 113, "Cubert", "Now, then, my man. Let's see if your reflexes are—"
6, 113, "Bender", "Faster!"
6, 113, "Cubert", "Get 'em! Get 'em! Get 'em!"
6, 113, "Bender", "Eh, foreign aggressors. Vhat's up?"
6, 113, "German #1", "Oh, we were just eating spaetzle and listening to Kraftwerk— I— I mean, ""Fire!"""
6, 113, "German #2", "That tap-dancing, decadent jazz baby is too fast for us!"
6, 113, "German #1", "Let's see him outrun a V-2!"
6, 113, "Bender", "It's my brains against your von Braun!"
6, 113, "German #1", "Ach! I could have fired a V-8!"
6, 113, "Walt", "Those guys normally stink. That's why we play them exclusively."
6, 113, "Larry", "Those cheaters must've cheated!"
6, 113, "Walt", "Now, Larry. Let's deal with this like mature adults.  Mommy!"
6, 113, "Mom", "What is it, you colicky bastards?!"
6, 113, "Walt", "We were playing video games and the other kids didn't play fair!"
6, 113, "Mom", "What?! Nobody rips off my kids but me! We can find out who they are through their motion-capture camera. It better not be those little Korean girls again. Aha! Got it!"
6, 113, "Bender", "Woo! We're the greatest! Mostly me!"
6, 113, "Mom", "Bender Rodríguez?"
6, 113, "Walt", "But he's a stock MomCorp bending unit.  And 'e's twelve years out-of-date. How could 'e possibly play that well?"
6, 113, "Bender", "Did you see me?! History came alive an' I killed it!"
6, 113, "Cubert", "If I overclock you some more, maybe we can beat those Korean girls!"
6, 113, "Mom", "Well, well. That nerd burglar overclocked the Robot's processor!"
6, 113, "Larry", "And that voids his warranty. Even an idiot like me knows that."
6, 113, "Mom", "An idiot like you knows nothing! What matters is... It violates the licence agreement. And that means I've got 'im right by his little—"
6, 113, "Smitty", "Ding dong. I'm sayin' ""Ding dong"" 'cause you don't 'ave a doorbell."
6, 113, "Cubert", "Hey, pigs."
6, 113, "URL", "We're lookin' for a Cubert J. Farnsworth."
6, 113, "Cubert", "You're porkin' at 'im!"
6, 113, "Smitty", "You're under arrest for felony violation of the MomCorp licence agreement."
6, 113, "Professor Farnsworth", "What's all this oinking about?! Who called the fuzz?!"
6, 113, "URL", "Sir, who's this boy's legal guardian?"
6, 113, "Professor Farnsworth", "You're porkin' at 'im!"
6, 113, "URL", "Then the charges apply to you too."
6, 113, "Professor Farnsworth", "Wha?"
6, 113, "Mom", "Farnsworth?! What a lucky break!"
6, 113, "Mom", "After all these years, I've got 'im! And legally too!"
6, 113, "Larry", "Even an idiot like me knows he'll be ruined."
6, 113, "Mom", "An idiot like you is correct!"
6, 113, "Professor Farnsworth", "You overclocked Bender?! What did I teach you about tinkering with machinery?"
6, 113, "Cubert", "How. You taught me how."
6, 113, "Professor Farnsworth", "I also taught you not to get caught! Oh, I wish I'd never cloned you."
6, 113, "Cubert", "It's not my fault! I didn't even know Bender had a licence agreement!"
6, 113, "Professor Farnsworth", "Neither did I— Ooh."
6, 113, "Professor Farnsworth", "Bender, as my newest employee, could you bend this drinking straw for me?"
6, 113, "Bender", "Sure. Let me just."
6, 113, "Mom", "First, click the licence agreement, deary."
6, 113, "Professor Farnsworth", "I really shouldn't agree to things I don't understand, but I'm slightly thirsty."
6, 113, "Professor Farnsworth", "Oh, God! I clicked without reading!"
6, 113, "Cubert", "An' I slightly modified a thing that I own!"
6, 113, "Professor Farnsworth", "We're monsters!"
6, 113, "Walt", "Congratulations, Mother. Can you die happy now?"
6, 113, "Mom", "Not yet!"
6, 113, "Walt", "Darn!"
6, 113, "Mom", "I can't rest until this bending unit is restored to factory specs."
6, 113, "Igner", "Why not?"
6, 113, "Mom", "If people learn they can overclock their old Robots, they won't buy my new Robots! This will not stand!  Hoverfish,  bring me the clock of Bender Rodríguez."
6, 113, "Hermes", "Good news, everyone! That's what the Professor would say if we weren't in jail facin' a life sentence."
6, 113, "Bender", "Guys! Guys! I discovered I have an extra processor in my compartment o' mystery. Bein' overclocked was a start, but, once I activate this processor, I'll be all like, ""You're a big dummy, Einstein! Get a haircut!"" Aw! Wow! I can't believe how stupid I used to be an' you still are. What are all these page-y things?"
6, 113, "Amy", "Look out! You're overheating!"
6, 113, "Bender", "Yeah, yeah. There. Now, I'm water-cooled. I can stimulate my intellect without further thermodynamical disruptions."
6, 113, "Fry", "I miss the old, illiterate Bender."
6, 113, "Hermes", "What's happened to you, mon? I thought you liked beer an' knock-knock jokes."
6, 113, "Bender", "I'm processin' so fast, it's like I can anticipate that the ceilin' fan's gonna fall an' knock Zoidberg unconscious."
6, 113, "Zoidberg", "Wrong, Mr. Genius."
6, 113, "Bender", "Not that ceilin' fan. In fact, lookin' ahead, it's obvious Mom won't allow me to stay accelerated like this. Hmmm. Who's up for a turkey dinner an' a game o' badminton?"
6, 113, "Hermes", "Say what?!"
6, 113, "Bender", "Yup."
6, 113, "Amy", "Uh-oh. 'E must be overheating again."
6, 113, "Hoverfish", "Bending unit, you are ordered to report for factory reset."
6, 113, "Bender", "Okay. Sure. But, first, this."
6, 113, "Zoidberg", "I hear turkey. Woop-woop-woop-woop-woop— Oh, boy. Ay... Ay. Ay."
6, 113, "Bender", "Ten more processors for me. Once I install these, I'll have access to the loftiest realms o' thought!"
6, 113, "Zoidberg", "Anyone have access to a lofty realm of gravy?"
6, 113, "Bender", "I can conceive of gravies that would boggle your tiny mind! But it's not safe here. So I'll need to find a hideout."
6, 113, "Fry", "Hideout? Bender, are you becoming some kinda supervillain?"
6, 113, "Bender", "Farewell, monobrains."
6, 113, "Yellow and red lawyer", "Your Honour, Mom is a poor, frail industrialist with three special sons who require constant neglect. Yet, isn't it true, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that this boy, this... Cubert Farnsworth..."
6, 113, "Cubert", "That's my name. Don't wear it out."
6, 113, "Yellow and red lawyer", "Deliberately robber her blind by improving his own Robot?!"
6, 113, "Fishy Joe", "It's true! 'E did it!"
6, 113, "Yellow and red lawyer", "No further questions for this jury."
6, 113, "Ron Whitey", "Before I call a recess for mimosas and horse breeding, can the defence produce the bending unit in question?"
6, 113, "Professor Farnsworth", "We don't know where the hell 'e is."
6, 113, "Hyper-Chicken", "Your Honour, that is something we cannot a-doodle-do."
6, 113, "Ron Whitey", "Then I'm holding the defendants in contempt and fining them ten-thousand dollars a day until they produce the Robot."
6, 113, "Hermes", "Oh! At that rate, Planet Express will be bankrupt in... Four fingers!"
6, 113, "Hermes", "It's been a good run, people, but this is the end."
6, 113, "Zoidberg", "Wait!  I've got it! This building's technically in the theatre district. If we could mount one big musical featuring everyone's talents, we might just save Planet Express!"
6, 113, "Nibbler", "We'll call it Nibbler on the Roof!"
6, 113, "Fry", "Alright!"
6, 113, "Zoidberg", "Hooray!"
6, 113, "Hermes", "We're saved!"
6, 113, "Leela", "I've been thinking a lot about moving on with my life. And hearing the words Nibbler on the Roof has given me the kick in the pants I needed. It's time for me to leave and make a fresh start."
6, 113, "Fry", "Don't go, Leela, please. You an' me... We were supposed to..."
6, 113, "Leela", "What?"
6, 113, "Fry", "I dunno.  But someday we'll find out.  Won't we?"
6, 113, "Leela", "Goodbye, Fry."
6, 113, "Fry", "I dunno, Randy. I just feel like my life's falling apart. The Professor's in jail and now Leela's gone forever."
6, 113, "Randy Munchnik", "Stay strong, Fry."
6, 113, "Fry", "You're the best friend I have left.  An' I barely even know you."
6, 113, "Randy Munchnik", "Have you thought about asking Bender for help?"
6, 113, "Fry", "What are you, Randy? A complete moron?!  I'd love to talk to Bender, but I 'ave no idea where 'e is."
6, 113, "Randy Munchnik", "Well, if 'e's runnin' on twelve processors, 'e must be some place with a lotta power and liquid coolant."
6, 113, "Fry", "Aw! You're no help at all!  I'm gonna go kill myself."
6, 113, "Fry", "Wait a second. Power. Liquid coolant.  That gives me the option of electrocution or drowning."
6, 113, "Paper-hatted salesman", "Barrels here.  Can't go over the Falls without a barrel."
6, 113, "Fry", "What are my chances of surviving in one o' those?"
6, 113, "Paper-hatted salesman", "Slim to none."
6, 113, "Fry", "I like those odds!"
6, 113, "Fry", "Wait. This isn't a barrel. It's just a stinking cask! I want my money  back!  Ow! Ow!"
6, 113, "Fry", "That was not worth three-thousand dollars."
6, 113, "Fry", "Hello? Anybody?"
6, 113, "Bender", "Fry?"
6, 113, "Fry", "Bender?! Are you in here?!"
6, 113, "Bender", "In here is the only place I'm not. I amuse myself."
6, 113, "Fry", "But— Bender?! What happened to you?"
6, 113, "Bender", "I'll try to put it in terms you can comprehend. I passed the existential singularity."
6, 113, "Fry", "Try harder!"
6, 113, "Bender", "I hacked myself inside-out and now the entire universe is my processor."
6, 113, "Fry", "Whoa! I definitely wanna hear about that. But, first, I need your help. The Professor and Cubert are in trouble and Leela left me. I'm in misery!"
6, 113, "Bender", "I've grown far beyond the petty concerns of your world. Every time I burp, a new galaxy is born.  Two if I've been eatin' broccoli. All existence is just a chess game. An' I can see fifty moves ahead. Human emotion no longer concerns me."
6, 113, "Fry", "But— But Randy said—"
6, 113, "Bender", "Randy?!  'Ave you been hangin' out with Randy?!"
6, 113, "Fry", "Please, Bender. If everything is a chess game for you, you must know how to help me."
6, 113, "Bender", "I'm sorry, Fry. But some games you just can't win.  Cubert and the Professor are guilty. The jury will vote to convict.  I can't change that."
6, 113, "Fry", "Well, what about Leela? Is there any hope things could still work out between us?"
6, 113, "Bender", "It's getting late. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some new heavy elements to create.  Better cover your nads. It may get a little non-Newtonian in here."
6, 113, "Ron Whitey", "Not only have the defendants failed to rebut the charges, they've not even presented any mitigating factors to recommend leniency. It strikes me as an extra-risky strategy."
6, 113, "Hyper-Chicken", "Did you say ""extra-crispy recipe""?"
6, 113, "Ron Whitey", "You know I didn't."
6, 113, "Hyper-Chicken", "Your Honour... If we could locate Bender Rodríguez, he would testify that my clients acted without malice."
6, 113, "Fry", "No, 'e wouldn't. Bender doesn't care about us anymore."
6, 113, "Zoidberg", "Someone used to care about me?! Hooray!"
6, 113, "Ron Whitey", "In that case, the jury will begin its deliberations. Bailiff,  release the jury collies."
6, 113, "Mom", "I finally nailed Farnsworth. Destroyin' the boy is just icing on the cake."
6, 113, "Larry", "No one destroys a boy like you, Mother."
6, 113, "Mom", "Thank you, you repulsive disappointment."
6, 113, "Fry", "Any word from Leela?"
6, 113, "Amy", "I heard she took a job selling deep-space real estate. Somewhere beyond the most distant thing ever observed with a telescope."
6, 113, "Fry", "She always liked not being observed with a telescope."
6, 113, "Ron Whitey", "Order. Order in the head."
6, 113, "Bender", "For reasons beyond even my comprehension, I 'ave returned to testify on behalf of the defendants."
6, 113, "Professor Farnsworth", "Yay!"
6, 113, "Cubert", "Yay, Bender!"
6, 113, "Fry", "I knew 'e cared about us!"
6, 113, "Hermes", "You said you knew he didn't care about us!"
6, 113, "Fry", "Leave me alone."
6, 113, "Yellow and red lawyer", "Your Honour, I object to this surprise witness. 'E's too surprising!"
6, 113, "Ron Whitey", "Sustained. Testimony has closed."
6, 113, "Bender", "But— Your Honour—"
6, 113, "Ron Whitey", "Silence! One more in-burst like that an' I'll have this courtroom removed from you! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!"
6, 113, "Bender", "I'm sorry, guys. I didn't realise I was late. I guess I'm not as smart as everybody thought."
6, 113, "Professor Farnsworth", "I was born in prison and I'll die in prison."
6, 113, "Bender", "There is still one hope. You're co-defendants. An' the jury might not wanna convict a twelve-year-old."
6, 113, "Mom", "Son of a nerd. He may be right! Make sure Farnsworth doesn't get off easy on account o' that snot-gobbling twerp."
6, 113, "Ron Whitey", "'As the jury reached a verdict?"
6, 113, "Fishy Joe", "Not just any verdict, Your Honour. A great verdict!"
6, 113, "Mom", "They're going to take pity on him!  Do something!"
6, 113, "Yellow and red lawyer", "Your Honour, prosecution moves to drop the charges against Cubert Farnsworth."
6, 113, "Ron Whitey", "Very well. The case against Cubert Farnsworth is hereby dismissed."
6, 113, "Cubert", "Told ya I'd get away with it."
6, 113, "Ron Whitey", "That'll do, pig. Please read the verdict against Professor Farnsworth."
6, 113, "Fishy Joe", "You got it, Judge. I think you'll find this verdict as fair as it is cruel."
6, 113, "Bender", "Your Honour,  I move for a mistrial on grounds of double jeopardy. Cubert Farnsworth cannot be tried twice for the same crime! Cubert is the Professor's clone. Ergo, they are legally the same person. Since you dismissed the charges against Cubert, you cannot convict the Professor of these same charges!"
6, 113, "Hyper-Chicken", "Well, I'll be a nugget's uncle. He's right!"
6, 113, "Ron Whitey", "What a brilliant legal shenanigan! Case dismissed."
6, 113, "Zoidberg", "Yay!"
6, 113, "Fry", "Yay!"
6, 113, "Hermes", "Yes!"
6, 113, "Fry", "Bender, you knew all this would happen, didn't you?"
6, 113, "Bender", "Yes. All except this part."
6, 113, "Mom", "If I can't bring down Farnsworth, I can at least dumb down 'is Robot. Take 'im away and reset 'im to factory-stupid condition!"
6, 113, "Fry", "Bender, wait. While you can still calculate the future, just tell me"
6, 113, "Bender", "There's no time now. Quick, Zoidberg! Take three steps to your right!"
6, 113, "Nibbler", "We've had some tough times,  but at least we won a Tony!"
6, 113, "Zoidberg", "You won a Tony. Feh!"
6, 113, "Fry", "Wow. You gave up your superintelligence to save us. Why did you come back?"
6, 113, "Bender", "Honestly, I couldn't think o' one good reason. But some decisions can't be made by thinking. Even if you're drunk! No galaxies there."
6, 113, "Leela", "Knock knock."
6, 113, "Bender", "Oh! Oh! Who's there?!"
6, 113, "Fry", "Leela?!"
6, 113, "Professor Farnsworth", "Yay!"
6, 113, "Bender", "Leela who?!"
6, 113, "Fry", "It's good  to see you.  Is it good to see me?"
6, 113, "Leela", "Of course."
6, 113, "Amy", "Come on in, Leela!  Take that ugly coat off!"
6, 113, "Leela", "Thanks. Hi, everybody."
6, 113, "Hermes", "So... Tell us. How's the intergalactic real estate going?"
6, 113, "Leela", "Pretty good. I just sold a castle to the King of Space. But, somehow, I keep finding myself thinking about this place. An' things."
6, 113, "Fry", "Things  like me or... Things like this badminton racket?"
6, 113, "Leela", "You, Fry. Bender, while you still have your giant brain, please... Tell me"
6, 113, "Fry", "It's too late, Leela. He's good, old Bender again. 'E's totally useless."
6, 113, "Bender", "Well, not totally! Before they reset me, I figured out the answers to life's great questions. Uh... This is the reason we exist. This is which ceilin' fans are gonna fall. Aha! Found it! Fry and Leela's Ultimate Fate... By Bender."
6, 113, "Fry", "Uh, it's probably better if we don't know. Uh, mystery of life and whatnot."
6, 113, "Leela", "Gimme that!"
6, 114, "Galactic Entity", "A wise man once said that nothing really dies. It just comes back in a new form. Then he died. So, next time you see a lowly salamander, think twice before you step on it. It might be you. Stand by for ""Reincarnation""."
6, 114, "Planet Express headquarters", "'Owdy, folks! Come on in!"
6, 114, "Leela", "Jumpin' Joe an' golly jeeper,I got one gigantic peeper.Sassafras an' banana oil,I'm a bee-youtiful purple-haired goyl."
6, 114, "Bender", "Watch it!"
6, 114, "Fry", "Oh, it's just that I love Leela something awful. Do you think a space-age dame like her would ever marry a two-bit, low-life delivery boy like me an' also I 'ave bad posture and severe financial problems?"
6, 114, "Bender", "Have you tried gettin' 'er pregnant?"
6, 114, "Fry", "Gosh, yes. I've tried an' tried, but, so far, I only got Amy pregnant."
6, 114, "Bender", "You know what your problem is?  Too much smoke in your face."
6, 114, "Fry", "I wanna ask Leela to marry me, but I can't afford a diamond ring big enough to express my love."
6, 114, "Bender", "That's for sure.  Not on the measly salary I steal from you each month."
6, 114, "Horn loudspeaker", "All crew, report to the laboratorium. Get a wiggle on."
6, 114, "Fry", "Thanks for the heads-up, Sparky."
6, 114, "Horn loudspeaker", "Mhm. Fish on Friday. An' Human flesh the rest of the week."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Movietone News, everyone.  I've discovered a new comet!"
6, 114, "Leela", "One side, boys. Let a lady take a gander."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Hang on. Let me just adjust it to your eye level."
6, 114, "Leela", "Holy matrimony!  That's one flashy rock!"
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Indeed. It's pure diamondium!"
6, 114, "Fry", "Um... Would it be possible to break off a piece an' put it in an engagement ring for reasons that are private?"
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Oh, fuff! Nothing in the universe can fracture diamondium. Not even God 1 an' God 2 put together. But behold!  The tail is composed of abrasive comet powder.  And that's just what I need to put a washday shine on my new Doomsday device.  Now hop in the flivver and score me some o' that sweet, sweet powder."
6, 114, "Hermes", "Comet ahoy!  Why, it's lit up like a smooth, refreshing Chesterfield."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Get plenty of that powder. I want this bomb to sparkle like the floor at Grand Central Station.  Over and out."
6, 114, "Amy", "Watch it, ya stumblebums! You're boopin' my betty!"
6, 114, "Fry", "Um... I'll be back in a jiff. I gotta go check this comet for anarchists."
6, 114, "Fry", "Wouldja look at that gem! Slap that shiner on a ring an' me an' Leela will be doing the married, horizontal Charleston in no time."
6, 114, "Fry", "Alright, diamond. You won those rounds. But I've got an ace up my hole."
6, 114, "Leela", "I love this time of day. There's such a beautiful stillness."
6, 114, "Fry", "Leela, I don't know if words can describe how I feel about you—"
6, 114, "Leela", "Good?"
6, 114, "Fry", "Huh. I guess they can. Anyhow, when a guy feels good about 'is sweetheart, 'e wants to prove it by giving 'er somethin' really... Good!"
6, 114, "Leela", "I'm still listenin', you big lug."
6, 114, "Fry", "What I'm tryin' to say is... In all the world, I couldn't find a diamond good enough for you. But then I found one out there...  Among the stars. The beautiful, affordable stars."
6, 114, "Leela", "You mean... When you disappeared up on the comet..."
6, 114, "Fry", "Exactly."
6, 114, "Leela", "I thought you snuck off to take a dump."
6, 114, "Fry", "A man can sneak off to do two things."
6, 114, "Leela", "Oh, Fry!"
6, 114, "Fry", "In exactly ten seconds, the Doomsday device will blow the stone loose. An', if my calculations are correct, it will land here on your finger."
6, 114, "Leela's finger", "You've made me the happiest finger in the whole wide hand!"
6, 114, "Fry", "Comet kaboomination in three, two—"
6, 114, "Bird", "Uh... Hello?! Cuckoo!"
6, 114, "Fry", "The diamond still didn't break!   Now, you'll never know 'ow much I love you.   It went kersplitters!"
6, 114, "Leela", "Fry, I don't need a diamond. You've given me the most beautiful rainbow I've ever seen! All the colours of the spectrum!"
6, 114, "Fry", "Not beautiful enough! A swell gal like you deserves better!"
6, 114, "Leela", "What's that?!  Is my eye playing trick on me?!  It's so beautiful! Fry, you've created a new colour! Totally different from any other colour or combination of colours."
6, 114, "Fry", "Shucks. It's still only half as beautiful as you.  Whoa!"
6, 114, "Leela", "Whoa! I wish this moment could last forever."
6, 114, "Fry", "Leela, my love, will you marry—"
6, 114, "Alien", "Bernilla, my love,  will you marry me?"
6, 114, "Bernilla", "Blorg! Blorg! A thousand times blorg!"
6, 114, "Bender", "Ba-da-ba-da-ba-dip-That's all you get, jerks!"
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Good news, multiplayers! After a lifetime of toil, I'm on the verge of solving all the mysteries of science!"
6, 114, "Bender", "So we can leave early?"
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Certainly not!  Not until I demonstrate this new microscope lens,  made from the debris of that diamondium comet."
6, 114, "Bender", "Eh, Professor."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Yes, Bender?"
6, 114, "Bender", "Boo!   Okay. Too bad. Goodbye."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "You're not through with this level! I have another lens."
6, 114, "Bender", "Bite my 8-bit metal ass.  That's ""Bite"" with a Y."
6, 114, "Hermes", "Whatever you say, mon."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Due to the lens' remarkable quark-lattice structure,  it should be capable of unthinkable magnification!  Come.  Follow me to the lab."
6, 114, "Bender", "Hey, I'm gonna try that! So long, meatbags! Son of a—"
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Eh, let me just insert  lens in microscope.  There! Now, for the first time, we may be able to see the infinitesimal fabric of matter itself.  Laying bare the most fundamental laws of the universe!"
6, 114, "Leela", "Hey, Fry. I know something you could lay bare."
6, 114, "Fry", "Leela! Shhh! I'm tryin' to listen to a physics lecture!"
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Now, to examine some matter. Any old matter will do."
6, 114, "Hermes", "Mon, that's some cheap-ass matter!  What the hell is it?"
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Oh,  it's just a log I found in a hole in the bottom of the sea. Now, to penetrate its deepest mysteries."
6, 114, "Leela", "Hey, Fry."
6, 114, "Fry", "Leela! No means no!"
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Oh, my! There's a frog on a bump on this log that I found in a hole in the bottom of the sea!"
6, 114, "Leela", "An' that's the ultimate secret of the universe?!"
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Apparently so. Wait! There's a snail on the tail of the frog on the bump on this log that I found in a hole in the bottom of the sea!"
6, 114, "Hermes", "Dear Eliza!"
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "The snail itself is composed of cells, molecules, atoms..."
6, 114, "Fry", "Pfff! Those things don't rhyme!"
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Things only rhyme below ten to the minus five angstroms, you dope!  Now, ions an' pions, muons an' gluons, neutrinos, gravitinos...  We're closing in on the very smallest particles of matter! For the first time, we're about to observe the fundamental structure of the universe.  Such detail.  Such finely wrought intricate beauty!"
6, 114, "Leela", "It's like staring into the face of God!"
6, 114, "Scruffy", "It's a mirror into Scruffy's soul."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "This explains everything! Even the Big Bang that created the universe! All that's left is the mathematics! Put down h-bar, uh, carry the infinity, and— My-reka! There it is! The Grand Unified Theory! Reducing all the laws of nature to a single equation!"
6, 114, "Amy", "Professor, you did it! You solved the problem that baffled Einstein an' drove Stephen Hawking to quit physics and become a cartoon voice actor!"
6, 114, "Stephen Hawking's head", "I like physics, but I love cartoons."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "This is the greatest moment in scientific history! At last, there are no more questions left to answer!"
6, 114, "Stephen Hawking's head", "Yay!"
6, 114, "Amy", "Yay!"
6, 114, "Hermes", "Woohoo! Alright! Well done, Professor. Okay. Back to work, everyone."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Wait. There are no more questions left to answer."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Oh."
6, 114, "Morbo", "And those are today's high scores. Linda?"
6, 114, "Linda", "Thanks, Morbo. Coming up next, Galaxians. What you need to know to protect your family."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "How do you people do it? How do you go on knowing there's nothing more to know?!"
6, 114, "Fry", "I watch TV. It's the next best thing to bein' alive."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "What's the use? I'm just not capable of the happiness of the dumb. If only I'd made some mistake!"
6, 114, "Stephen Hawking's head", "You didn't. I checked the invariance of your Lagrangian. Hubba-hubba."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Then there's nothing left to do! Nothing!"
6, 114, "Bender", "Would it cheer you up if I punched Fry in the groin? 'Cause I'll do it. Regardless. Body blow! Body blow!"
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "I devoted every waking minute to answering the fundamental questions of science."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "I never married."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Rarely went outside!"
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "And, now that I've found all the answers, I realise that what I was living for were the questions!"
6, 114, "Fry", "That stinks, Professor. Too bad the universe made it turn out that way and not some other way. I wonder why it did that."
6, 114, "Stephen Hawking's head", "Probably magnets."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Shut up, Hawking. Fry, you idiot!  You're a genius! Why are the laws of physics what they are? Instead of some other laws? To find out, we'd have to recreate the conditions before the Big Bang. It would take decades of work by thousands of scientists in a particle accelerator powered by dump trucks of flaming grant money.  Of course, there'd be no guarantee of success.  And, in any case, I'd never live to see it."
6, 114, "Leela", "I'm surprised you lived through that sentence."
6, 114, "Hermes", "Sorry you wasted your life, Professor. I guess you never know everything after all."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Indeed. The pursuit of knowledge is hopeless and eternal.  Hooray!"
6, 114, "Amy", "Yay!"
6, 114, "Hermes", "Yeah-heah!"
6, 114, "Bender", "Woohoo! Alright! Yay!"
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Action Delivery Force, assemble!"
6, 114, "Bender", "And me, Mighty Merchandise Robot!"
6, 114, "Transition Announcer", "Meanwhile, on Space Planet 4, the Aliens who communicate by dancing..."
6, 114, "Transition Announcer", "Were worshipping a giant comet."
6, 114, "Subtitle", "All hail great comet! Beloved mascot of popular shrimp crunch snack! Also God. Foreigners killed our God! Many words of disapproval!"
6, 114, "Leela", "Team assembled!  What is that box, you old witch?"
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Ha ha ha! I'll never tell you.  It's a deep space-emotion detector.  The detector can tell you're impressed. You should be!  Wha? The marvellous device. It's detecting a massive burst of anger. From deep space!"
6, 114, "Subtitle", "There is Earth! Attack it as previously discussed!"
6, 114, "Fry", "Flying bananas? Ha ha! I will slice them on my morning fish porridge."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "This is no time for one of your jokes, Fry."
6, 114, "Fry", "I will tell you something that's no joke.  I will lead the defence fight."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Ha ha ha ha! Don't make me laugh. If we fight, we'll surely be destroyed."
6, 114, "Hermes", "Then what is our only hope?!"
6, 114, "Amy", "We must summon Zagtar, defender of space!"
6, 114, "Hermes", "You forget!"
6, 114, "Hermes", "Zagtar was destroyed by the crystal space devil!"
6, 114, "Leela", "The crystal space devil was once my brother, Prince Hiroshi."
6, 114, "Leela", "I mourn his loss. But what matters now is protecting Earth from that fruit armada."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "I see your mother, the water Mutant, didn't raise any fools, Turanga Leela. Our only hope is to communicate with the Aliens. And show them our peaceful intentions."
6, 114, "Bender", "Perhaps they speak perfect English... As do we."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "We can't take that chance! We'll need my universal auto-translator!"
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "This  is my universal auto-translator!"
6, 114, "Fry", "That will show them our peaceful intentions."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "The only question is, ""Who should  be our spokesman?!"""
6, 114, "Zoidberg", "Me! Me! Choose Zoidberg."
6, 114, "Fry", "Zoidberg, a diplomat? The list of things I've heard now contains everything."
6, 114, "Zoidberg", "Hear my words. My shell may be tough like a samurai honeymoon mask, but inside I'm as soft and sensitive as a girl made of custard!"
6, 114, "Cubert", "Custard time?!  Hooray!"
6, 114, "Zoidberg", "Please! I am certain I will succeed with my delicate manner. Oops."
6, 114, "Leela", "Instead, I will send the peace transmission. Most honoured visitors, we greet you in peace."
6, 114, "Subtitle", "Why does it flap its face hole? I am puzzled, for we don't know what mouths are. It's a threat! Destruct them!"
6, 114, "Hattie", "Kajigeru desu!"
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "All attempts to communicate with the Aliens have failed. I fear our only option is thrilling space battle."
6, 114, "Bender and Fry", "Power friends, go!"
6, 114, "Male voice", "Launch all missiles! Launch all missiles!"
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "We were defeated in battle."
6, 114, "Bender", "Oh, no! They're forming Gigatron!"
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Defeat is ours. If we can't communicate with these bone-jelly ghosts, we're doomed!"
6, 114, "Amy", "Professor, I 'ave analysed the Aliens' movements with this movement analyser."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "That device was a gift from my ancestors. Go on."
6, 114, "Amy", "It seems their movements are a form of language. Rather than speaking Ja—"
6, 114, "Transition Announcer", "English!"
6, 114, "Amy", "Like us, they speak by dancing."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Of course! Having no mouths our ears, they could only communicate through motions!"
6, 114, "Fry", "Or perhaps by odours!"
6, 114, "Bender", "That is 'ow you communicate!"
6, 114, "Amy, Leela, Fry, Bender, and Hermes", "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
6, 114, "Leela", "Then our only hope to talk to them is by doing a peace dance. But it will have to be smoother an' more fluid than any movement mankind is capable of."
6, 114, "Fry", "What if we hire a buttered geisha?"
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Another one of your ill-timed jokes, Fry?!"
6, 114, "Fry", "You an' I are enemies now!"
6, 114, "Zoidberg", "Hear my words. I believe I, the most humble member of Action Delivery Team, could do such a dance!"
6, 114, "Hermes", "Surely, your heart shell is too rigid! I call on anyone but you to do the peace dance!"
6, 114, "Zoidberg", "Aw."
6, 114, "Bender", "Of course, I will do the peace dance. But I will need 'elp."
6, 114, "Bender and Fry", "Super Dance Squad, initiate!"
6, 114, "Amy", "We all hope they're communicating a peaceful message!"
6, 114, "Subtitle", "Hey Aliens, we will kill you! And dishonor your widows by making them gather wood! Fire a the weapon!"
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Wha, wha?! We thought we were so smart with our science and dancing, but look at us now"
6, 114, "Zoidberg", "The shame is too great. It's time to end this! Huh-yah! Feh!"
6, 114, "Leela", "Zoidberg,  stop! We are too scared right now to enjoy the ceremony of your death!"
6, 114, "Zoidberg", "No hara-kiri today, but heiwa no dansu! The gelatinous dance of peace!"
6, 114, "Hermes", "You may be gelatinous, but not even the Mochi Phanton could perform such intricate motions!"
6, 114, "Zoidberg", "Says you, salaryman!"
6, 114, "Subtitle", "What is the medical crab doing?"
6, 114, "Zoidberg", "Behold! The dance of peace!"
6, 114, "Bender", "The dance is so complex! The eye can barely follow it!"
6, 114, "Zoidberg", "I may be the humblest Team member, but I have given it my all."
6, 114, "Amy", "I underestimated you, medical crab. But will the Aliens understand?!"
6, 114, "Subtitle", "We have understand peace."
6, 114, "Subtitle", "Farewell, Action Team."
6, 114, "Professor Farnsworth", "Zoidberg, you are the greatest hero. You saved us all."
6, 114, "Zoidberg", "For now. But another threat from the stars is sure to arise next week at the same time!"
6, 114, "Leela", "Until then..."
6, 114, "Bender and Fry", "Action Delivery Force star-hero rocket engage!"
